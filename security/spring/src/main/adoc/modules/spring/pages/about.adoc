This guide describes the configuration of the Spring implementation of Apache Isis' xref:refguide:core:index/security/authentication/Authenticator.adoc[Authenticator] SPI.

It does _not_ however provide any implementation of xref:refguide:core:index/security/authorization/Authorizor.adoc[Authorizor] SPI.
You will therefore need to configure an alternative implementation, eg the xref:bypass:about.adoc[Bypass] implementation (to disable authorisation checks completely), or use the xref:secman:about.adoc[SecMan] implementation.


include::docs:mavendeps:partial$setup-and-configure-dependencyManagement.adoc[leveloffset=+1]


== Dependency

In the webapp module of your application, add the following dependency:

[source,xml]
.pom.xml
----
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.isis.security</groupId>
        <artifactId>isis-security-spring</artifactId>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

[[_update-appmanifest]]
== Update AppManifest

In your application's `AppManifest` (top-level Spring `@Configuration` used to bootstrap the app), import the `IsisModuleSecuritySpring` module and remove any other `IsisModuleSecurityXxx` modules.

Also, as this module provides no implementation of the xref:refguide:core:index/security/authorization/Authorizor.adoc[Authorizor] SPI, instead you will need some an alternative implementation, such as the xref:bypass:about.adoc[Bypass] implementation.
(Note: this will in effect disable authorisation checks).

[source,java]
.AppManifest.java
----
@Configuration
@Import({
        ...
        IsisModuleSecuritySpring.class,     // <.>
        AuthorizorBypass.class,             // <.>
        ...
})
public class AppManifest {
}
----
<.> make sure that no other `IsisModuleSecurityXxx` module is imported.
<.> or some other implementation of `Authorizor`.


== Design

The module brings in a transitive dependency to `org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-security`:

[source,xml]
.pom.xml
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-security</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

This enables security by default, and should then be adjusted as required to enable access.
See the Spring documentation for details on how to do this, for example:

* link:https://spring.io/guides/gs/securing-web/[Spring security introductory guide]
* link:https://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot-security-autoconfiguration[Baeldung article] on `spring-boot-starter-security`
* link:https://www.tutorialspoint.com/spring_boot/spring_boot_securing_web_applications.htm[Tutorialspoint] tutorial on `spring-boot-starter-security`

The module itself configures a filter that is installed at the end of Spring Security's filter chain.
It uses the link:https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/current/api/org/springframework/security/core/context/SecurityContextHolder.html[SecurityContextHolder] to obtain the current authentication:

[source,java]
.SpringSecurityFilter.java
----
val springAuthentication = SecurityContextHolder.getContext().getAuthentication();
if(springAuthentication==null
        || !springAuthentication.isAuthenticated()) {
    httpServletResponse.setStatus(HttpServletResponse.SC_UNAUTHORIZED);
    return; // not authenticated
}
----

For an authenticated user the `org.apache.isis.viewer.wicket.roles.USER` role -- as required by xref:vw::about.adoc[Web UI (Wicket viewer)]  -- is automatically added to the list of roles.



[#walk-through-in-memory]
== Walk-through : In-memory

Using Spring Security we can configure your app with various authentication providers.
In this section we describe how to modify the xref:docs:starters:helloworld.adoc[HelloWorld] starter app to use an in-memory authenticator.


=== Code Changes

First, we need an implementation of `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` to setup the inmemory authenticator:

[source,java]
----
@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter
{
    @Override
    protected void configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) throws Exception {
        auth.inMemoryAuthentication()
                .withUser("sven")
                .password(passwordEncoder().encode("pass"))
                .roles("USER");   // <.>
                ;
    }

    @Bean
    public PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder() {
        return new BCryptPasswordEncoder();
    }
}
----
<.> at least one role must be assigned to each user.

Next, we configure the necessary components (including `SecurityConfig`, above).
As discussed <<_update-appmanifest,above>>, we need to reference Apache Isis' Spring security module and also an implementation of xref:refguide:core:index/security/authorization/Authorizor.adoc[Authorizor] SPI, eg the xref:bypass:about.adoc[Bypass] implementation:

[source,java]
.AppManifest.java
----
@Configuration
@Import({
        ...
        IsisModuleSecuritySpring.class,
        AuthorizorBypass.class,
        SecurityConfig.class,
        ...
})
public class AppManifest {
}
----


Lastly (and optionally), the swagger/REST API is not configured for spring security, so we replace the `index.html` page with one to redirect straight to the xref:vw::about.adoc[Wicket Viewer]:

[source,html]
.static/index.html
----
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">
<html xmlns:th="http://www.thymeleaf.org">
<head>
    <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1">
    <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0;url=/wicket/" />
</head>
<body>
<div id="wrapper">
    <!-- we just redirect immediately, because swagger/restful API not configured to use spring security -->
</div>
</body>
</html>
----

=== Run the application

You should now be able to run the application.
You will see that the usual login page is replaced by one provided by Spring:

[#authenticatorconverter-spi]
== AuthenticatorConverter SPI

The module provides a number of implementations of xref:refguide:security:index/spring/authconverters/AuthenticationConverter.adoc[AuthenticationConverter] that (attempt to) convert a Spring `Authentication` object into an Apache Isis `UserMemento`.

Several implementations are provided by default for most of the common representations of a user principal, including support for link:https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/current/api/org/springframework/security/core/userdetails/UserDetails.html[UserDetails] (as returned in the <<walk-through-in-memory,in-memory walk through above>>) and link:https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/current/api/org/springframework/security/oauth2/core/user/OAuth2User.html[OAuth2User] (as returned in the <<walk-through-oauth2,oauth2 walk-through>>).
This SPI does though provide additional flexibility for other security technologies that may be supported by link:https://spring.io/projects/spring-security[Spring].
