WARNING: TODO: this content has not yet been reviewed/updated for v2.0


By and large the security mechanisms within Isis are transparent to the rest of the framework.
That said, it is the responsibility of the viewers to ensure that for each request there is a valid user session present.
The sections below explain how this works.

NOTE: the content below also appears in the respective user guides for the xref:vw:ROOT:about.adoc[Web UI (Wicket viewer)] and the xref:vro:ROOT:about.adoc[REST API (Restful Objects viewer)].
