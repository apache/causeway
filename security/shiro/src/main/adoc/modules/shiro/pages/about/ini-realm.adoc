The Shiro concept of a `Realm` allows different implementations of both the authentication and authorisation mechanism to be plugged in.

Probably the simplest realm to use is Shiro's built-in `IniRealm`, which reads from the (same) `WEB-INF/shiro.ini` file.

This is suitable for prototyping, but isn't intended for production use, if only because user/password credentials are stored in plain text.
Nevertheless, it's a good starting point.
The app generated by both the xref:docs:starters:helloworld.adoc[HelloWorld] and xref:docs:starters:simpleapp.adoc[SimpleApp] starter apps are configured to use this realm.

The diagram below shows the Isis and components involved:

image::configuration/configuring-shiro/ini/configure-shiro-to-use-ini-realm.PNG[width="600px",link="{imagesdir}/configuration/configuring-shiro/ini/configure-shiro-to-use-ini-realm.PNG"]

The realm is responsible for validating the user credentials, and then creates a Shiro link:http://shiro.apache.org/static/latest/apidocs/org/apache/shiro/subject/Subject.html[`Subject`] which represents the user (for the current request).
Apache Isis `Authenticator` component then interacts with the `Subject` in order to check permissions.




== Shiro Configuration

To use the built-in `IniRealm`, we add the following to `WEB-INF/shiro.ini`:

[source,ini]
----
securityManager.realms = $iniRealm
----

(Unlike other realms) there is no need to "define" `$iniRealm`; it is automatically available to us.

Specifying `$iniRealm` means that the usernames/passwords, roles and permissions are read from the `shiro.ini` file itself.
Specifically:

* the users/passwords and their roles from the `[users]` sections;
* the roles are mapped to permissions in the `[roles]` section.

The format of these is described below.

=== `[users]` section

This section lists users, passwords and their roles.

For example:

[source,ini]
----
sven = pass, admin_role
dick = pass, user_role, analysis_role, self-install_role
bob  = pass, user_role, self-install_role
----
The first value is the password (eg "pass", the remaining values are the role(s).


=== `[roles]` section

This section lists roles and their corresponding permissions.

For example:

[source,ini]
----
user_role = *:ToDoItems:*:*,\
            *:ToDoItem:*:*,\
            *:TodoAppDashboard:*:*
analysis_role = *:ToDoItemAnalysis:*:*,\
            *:ToDoItemsByCategoryViewModel:*:*,\
            *:ToDoItemsByDateRangeViewModel:*:*
self-install_role = *:ToDoItemsFixturesService:install:*
admin_role = *
----

The value is a comma-separated list of permissions for the role.  The format is:

[source,ini]
----
packageName:className:memberName:r,w
----

where:

* `memberName` is the property, collection or action name.
* `r` indicates that the member is visible
* `w` indicates that the member is usable (editable or invokable)

and where each of the parts of the permission string can be wildcarded using `*`.

Because these are wildcards, a '*' can be used at any level. Additionally, missing levels assume wildcards.

Thus:

[source,ini]
----
com.mycompany.myapp:Customer:firstName:r,w   # view or edit customer's firstName
com.mycompany.myapp:Customer:lastName:r      # view customer's lastName only
com.mycompany.myapp:Customer:placeOrder:*    # view and invoke placeOrder action
com.mycompany.myapp:Customer:placeOrder      # ditto
com.mycompany.myapp:Customer:*:r             # view all customer class members
com.mycompany.myapp:*:*:r                    # view-only access for all classes in myapp package
com.mycompany.myapp:*:*:*                    # view/edit for all classes in myapp package
com.mycompany.myapp:*:*                      # ditto
com.mycompany.myapp:*                        # ditto
com.mycompany.myapp                          # ditto
*                                            # view/edit access to everything
----

[TIP]
====
The format of the permissions string is configurable in Shiro, and Apache Isis uses this to provide an extended wildcard format, described xref:security:shiro:about/enhanced-wildcard-permission.adoc[here].

== Externalized IniRealm

There's no requirement for all users/roles to be defined in the `shiro.ini` file.
Instead, a realm can be defined that loads its users/roles from some other resource.

For example:

[source,ini]
----
$realm1=org.apache.shiro.realm.text.IniRealm # <1>
realm1.resourcePath=classpath:webapp/realm1.ini # <2>
----
<1> happens to (coincidentally) be the link:http://shiro.apache.org/static/latest/apidocs/org/apache/shiro/realm/text/IniRealm.html[same implementation] as Shiro's built-in $iniRealm
<2> in this case load the users/roles from the `src/main/resources/webapp/realm1.ini` file.

Note that a URL could be provided as the `resourcePath`, so a centralized config file could be used.
Even so, the

[NOTE]
====
If configured this way then the `[users]` and `[roles]` sections of `shiro.ini` become unused.
Instead, the corresponding sections from for `realm1.ini` are used instead.
