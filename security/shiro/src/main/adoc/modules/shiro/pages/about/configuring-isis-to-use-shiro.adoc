Apache Isis' security mechanism is configurable, specifying an `Authenticator` and an `Authorizor` (non-public) APIs.
The Shiro security mechanism is an integration wih Apache Shiro that implements both interfaces.

[TIP]
====
Both the xref:docs:starters:helloworld.adoc[HelloWorld] and xref:docs:starters:simpleapp.adoc[SimpleApp] starter apps are pre-configured to use Apache Shiro, so much of what follows may well have been set up already.
====


== Telling Apache Isis to use Shiro


To tell Apache Isis to use Shiro, include `IsisModuleSecurityShiro` module in the top-level "app manifest".

For example, the xref:docs:starters:simpleapp.adoc[SimpleApp] starter app bootstraps using:

[source,java]
----
@Configuration
@Import({
        // ...
        IsisModuleSecurityShiro.class,  // <.>
        // ...
})
// ...
public class AppManifest {
}
----
<.> configures Shiro.

This installs the appropriate implementation (the `ShiroAuthenticatorOrAuthorizor` class) that use Shiro's APIs to perform authentication and authorization:

image::configuration/configure-isis-to-use-shiro.png[width="600px"]

The figure above doesn't tell the whole story; we haven't yet seen how Shiro itself is configured to use realms.
The `ShiroAuthenticatorOrAuthorizor` is in essence the glue between the Apache Isis runtime and Shiro.


== Configuring Shiro Authenticator

The `ShiroAuthenticatorOrAuthorizor` class itself supports a single optional property.
This can be configured in `authentication_shiro.properties` file:

[source,ini]
----
isis.security.shiro.autoLogoutIfAlreadyAuthenticated=false
----

This configuration property only comes into effect for the xref:vro:ROOT:about.adoc[Restful Objects viewer]; if set then the Shiro subject - if found to be still authenticated - will be logged out anyway and then re-authenticated.

[WARNING]
====
There should generally be no need to change this property from its default (`false`).
Setting it to `true` may cause a race condition resulting in exceptions being logged.
====



== Bootstrapping Shiro

//TODO: v2: this configuration is no longer required in `web.xml`, instead is configured programmatically by the framework (`WebModule_Shiro`).


The Shiro environment (in essence, thread-locals holding the security credentials) needs to be bootstrapped using the following settings in the `WEB-INF/web.xml` file:

[source,xml]
----
<listener>
    <listener-class>org.apache.shiro.web.env.EnvironmentLoaderListener</listener-class>
</listener>
<filter>
    <filter-name>ShiroFilter</filter-name>
    <filter-class>org.apache.shiro.web.servlet.ShiroFilter</filter-class>
</filter>
<filter-mapping>
    <filter-name>ShiroFilter</filter-name>
    <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
</filter-mapping>
----

Based on this Shiro will then read `shiro.ini` file to configure its Realm definitions for authentication and authorization.



== `shiro.ini`

The `shiro.ini` file is used to specify the realm(s) that Shiro will delegate to:

[source,ini]
----
securityManager.realms = $realmName
----

Shiro's ini file supports a "poor-man's" dependency injection (link:https://shiro.apache.org/configuration.html[their words]), and so `$realmName` in the above example is a reference to a realm defined elsewhere in `shiro.ini`.
The subsequent sections describe the specifics for thevarious realm implementations available to you.


It's also possible to configure Shiro to support multiple realms.

[source,ini]
----
securityManager.realms = $realm1,$realm2
----

You can learn more about Shiro realms in the link:http://shiro.apache.org/realm.html[Shiro documentation].
