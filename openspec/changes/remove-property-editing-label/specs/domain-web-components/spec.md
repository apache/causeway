## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Property editing semantics
An editable `<causeway-property>` SHALL provide view, preparing, editing, validating, saving, success, and failed interaction states driven by its rich-schema capabilities.
During stable ordinary editing, the component MUST communicate edit mode through the focused editor and its controls without rendering a redundant “Editing” status label or empty status row.
Meaningful preparing, validating, saving, correction-required, and unsupported states SHALL retain their bounded status presentation.

#### Scenario: User starts editing
- **WHEN** a visible and enabled property advertises a supported update operation and the user activates edit
- **THEN** the component selects an editor from the semantic editor registry
- **AND** lazily obtains the supported editor semantics needed for the current property
- **AND** focuses and presents the editor with Save and Cancel controls without a separate “Editing” status label

#### Scenario: User cancels editing
- **WHEN** the user cancels before a successful update
- **THEN** the component restores its authoritative context value
- **AND** does not execute an update command

#### Scenario: Property is not editable
- **WHEN** the property is hidden, disabled, or lacks an update capability
- **THEN** the component does not expose an enabled edit affordance

#### Scenario: Property edit changes state
- **WHEN** an active property editor is preparing, validating, saving, failed, or unsupported
- **THEN** the component presents the corresponding bounded meaningful status
- **AND** does not replace that status with an ordinary “Editing” label
