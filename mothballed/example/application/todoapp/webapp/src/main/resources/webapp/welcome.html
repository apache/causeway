<p class="intro">
    <a href="http://isis.apache.org" target="_blank">Apache Isis</a>&trade; is a platform to let you rapidly develop
    domain-driven apps in Java.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This app has been generated using Isis' 
    <a href="http://isis.apache.org/intro/getting-started/todo%61pp-archetype.html" target="_blank">TodoApp</a> archetype,
    which configures Isis' most commonly used components in a straightforward &quot;todo&quot; app.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The core functionality of the app is provided by the
    <a href="https://github.com/apache/isis/blob/master/example/application/todo%61pp/dom/src/main/java/dom/todo/ToDoItem.java" target="_blank">ToDoItem</a> domain class.
    Supporting services provide additional capabilities.
