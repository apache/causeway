${symbol_pound} specify system components.
${symbol_pound}
${symbol_pound} The values correspond to the named components in the installer-registry.properties file
${symbol_pound} in the org.apache.isis.core:isis-core-runtime JAR (in the org.apache.isis.core.runtime package)
${symbol_pound}
${symbol_pound} Although all configuration could reside in isis.properties, the recommendation is
${symbol_pound} to split out into component specific files:
${symbol_pound} 
${symbol_pound}    xxx_yyy.properties files
${symbol_pound}
${symbol_pound} where
${symbol_pound}    * xxx is the component type, and
${symbol_pound}    * yyy is the component name.
${symbol_pound}
${symbol_pound} For example, viewer_wicket.properties holds configuration information specific to the Wicket viewer.
