Specify and test your <Isis> domain model

  If you decide to use <Isis> for more than just {{{./develop.html}prototyping}}, 
  then you'll probably want to formally test your domain model.

  <Isis> integrates with two testing frameworks to help you, Junit and Concordion.
  Being able to test your domain models independently of the other gives you
  confidence when you move onto deploying your application {{{./deploy-own-framework.html}as}} 
  {{{./deploy-as-rest.html}you}} {{{./deploy-as-webapp.html}prefer}}.
  
* {JUnit integration}

  <Isis> provides a JUnit test runner in order to integrate with {{{http://junit.org}JUnit}}.
  This is provided through its {{{../viewer/junit/index.html}JUnit viewer}}.
  
  For example, the following (based on the quickstart archetype) tests
  that a todo-item marked as complete cannot be marked as done once more.
  
+-----------------------------------------------------------------
@RunWith(IsisTestRunner.class)
public class ToDoItemTest {

    private ToDoItem toDoItem;

    @Before
    public void setUp() {
        toDoItem = toDoItems.notYetDone().get(0);
        toDoItem = wrapped(toDoItem);
    }
    
    @Test
    public void cannotMarkAsDoneTwice() throws Exception {
        toDoItem.markAsDone();
        try {
            toDoItem.markAsDone();
            fail("Should not been disabled");
        } catch (DisabledException e) {
            assertThat(e.getMessage(), is("Already done"));
        }
    }
    
    ...
}
+-----------------------------------------------------------------
  
  The JUnit integration works by wrapping each domain object pojo in a proxy
  object.  This proxy object is responsible for ensuring that the
  underlying pojo is interacted with in the same way as it would were being
  viewed in a regular Isis viewer.
  
  For example, the call to <<<markAsDone()>>> action is transparently 
  prefaced by a check to ensure that the action is not disabled.  If the
  action is disabled, then the proxy throws the DisabledException. 
  
  It might seem a little odd - given that there is no UI - to call Isis' JUnit 
  integration a "viewer".  However, it does simulate what a viewer does, and 
  fits into the same architectural layer as the other viewers.
  
* {BDD integration}

  <Isis> also provides an integration with {{{http://concordion.org}Concordion}},
  which is a BDD (behaviour-driven design) framework.  This is provided through its 
  {{{../viewer/bdd/index.html}BDD viewer}}.
  
  The idea behind BDD is to allow a business stakeholder to describe the desired
  behaviour of the system in non-technical terms, and then to gain feedback )as to
  whether that behaviour has been implemented) in the similar way.
  
  Concordion's implementation of this idea is to capture the specification using
  XHTML.  This XHTML is then annotated by the developer inline with corresponding Java methods. 
  Concordion's own JUnit test runner parses the XHTML in order to call these methods, which
  in turn interact with the system-under-test.  Running the test also generates a copy of the 
  original XHTML, this time annotated to indicate the result (success or failure)
  of the test.

  Isis' integration with Concordion is to provide a pre-defined set of Java methods
  in a test case, by which the domain model can be interacted in a regular way.  For example,
  using these methods the analyst can assert on the results of invoking an action, or, indeed,
  could assert that an action is disabled. 

  One caveat with Isis' Concordion integration: Concordion itself uses {{{http://xom.nu}XOM}}, 
  an XML library which is LGPL licensed.  LGPL is incompatible with the Apache license, which 
  means we are unable to explicitly include XOM as a transient dependency.  You are free to use
  the Concordion integration, but you should be aware that doing so will require you to
  explicitly configure the use of this non-Apache dependency.
