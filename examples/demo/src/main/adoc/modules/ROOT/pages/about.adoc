= Demo

The Demo provides an introduction to the features and components available in Apache Isis.

It allows you to learn the very basics and also to discover some of the more advanced features, the framework has to offer. See the Docker section below on how to get started.

== Getting Started (Docker)

NOTE: Further on *<tag>* is used as a placeholder for the docker image tag of your choice. When omitted the latest version is used. Actual tag names might be changed without notice. Currently we have tag *nightly*. See https://hub.docker.com/r/apacheisis/demo-springboot/tags/[apacheisis/demo-springboot] (Docker-Hub)

=== Prereqs

Install https://www.docker.com/community-edition[Docker] on your computer.

=== Pulling the Docker Image

.pull the Demo image
----
docker pull apacheisis/demo-springboot:<tag>
----

=== Running the Docker Image

.run the Demo image
----
docker run --name demo --detach -p8080:8080 apacheisis/demo-springboot:<tag>
----

This will start a new Docker container named `demo`.

The Demo can then be accessed at http://localhost:8080/wicket/[].
Login with `sven:pass`.

.stop and remove the container named `demo`
----
docker stop demo && docker rm demo
----

=== Customization (Context Path)

.run using a _context-path_, add an environment variable eg. `ContextPath=/demo`
----
docker run --name demo --detach -p8080:8080 -eContextPath=/demo apacheisis/demo-springboot:<tag>
----

=== Customization (Prototyping)

.run in _prototyping_ mode, add an environment variable `PROTOTYPING=true`.
----
docker run --name demo --detach -p8080:8080 -ePROTOTYPING=true apacheisis/demo-springboot:<tag>
----

=== Customization (Attached Console)

To run the container with your console attached, replace the '--detach' argument with '-it'.

.use CTRL-C to stop and detach
----
docker run --name demo -it -p8080:8080 apacheisis/demo-springboot:<tag>
