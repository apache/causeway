Apache Causeway applications can nominate a view model to act as the home page.
These typically act as a dashboard, displaying the most useful current information to the user (perhaps a task list, or alerts).
Such a home page would have a number of repository services injected into it, in order to query and render those tasks or alerts.

Home pages often also have the framework's link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/${CAUSEWAY_VERSION}/applib/index/services/user/UserService.html[UserService] injected, in order that the information displayed is relevant to the current user.

== How this demo works

This demo application's home page is pretty simple, not much more than a couple of hard-coded text fields that you're reading right now.

In terms of code, the framework indicates which view model is the home page using the link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/${CAUSEWAY_VERSION}/applib-ant/HomePage.html[@HomePage] annotation:

[source,java]
----
include::DemoHomePage.java[tags="class"]
----

<.> declares this view-model class to be used as the viewer's homepage, there can be only one
<.> contributes the description property on the right hand side (in other words, what you're reading right now).
<.> customises the title, top left
<.> the welcome text, on the left handside
<.> framework-provided service, injected by the framework so that the home page object can find the current user.
This allows us to "personalise" the title on this home page.
