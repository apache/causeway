"Value types" represent concepts that have intrinsic value and are immutable.
They are often used to model concepts such as money, dates, addresses, and other types of measurements or quantities that have a specific value.

Value types are distinct from "entity types," which represent objects with a unique identity that can change over time.
In contrast, value types have no identity of their own, and two value objects with the same values are considered equal.
It's also common for value types to define an algebra, where they can be combined through operations to produce new values.

A scalar value type has a single data attribute, while a composite value type has multiple.
This page demonstrates the use of *composite* value types.

== How this demo works

This page object defines a single property whose type is a value type, `ComplexNumber`, intended to model the mathematical concept of link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number[complex numbers].
This is a composite value type, consisting of two `double` values: the _real_ part, and the _imaginary_ part.

The value held by this page object can be changed using the two actions.
These simply delegate down to the operations defined by the value type itself.


In terms of code:

* The `ComplexNumber` type is defined as:
+
[source,java]
.ComplexNumber.java
----
include::ComplexNumber.java[tags=class]
----
<.> Defines this as a value type to the framework
<.> Uses lombok to define getters, a `hashCode()`, `equals()`, `toString()` and a constructor.
<.> The two data attributes
<.> Operations that define a simple algebra for this type.

* this page object defines this as a single property:
+
[source,java]
.CompositeValueTypePage.java
----
include::CompositeValueTypePage.java[tags=class]
----

* the mixin action to add a value is:
+
[source,java]
.CompositeValueTypePage_addComplexNumber.java
----
include::CompositeValueTypePage_addComplexNumber.java[tags=class]
----
<.> presents two parameters; the first is a read-only copy of the value held by the page object
<.> delegates to the `add` operation on the `ComplexNumber` value type
<.> defaults the first parameter to that held by the page object
<.> makes the first parameter disabled; the end-user can only enter a value for the second parameter.
+
The action to subtract is similar.

=== Value Semantics Provider

The framework also needs to know the structure of the value type.
This is done by providing an implementation of a link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/value/semantics/ValueSemanticsProvider.html[ValueSemanticsProvider].

* the `ValueSemanticsProvider` implementation is:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
.ComplexNumberValueSemantics.java
----
include::ComplexNumberValueSemantics.java[tags=class]
----
<.> declares a "default" mixin that the framework uses to present an action prompt to set the parts of the value type.
This is discussed in more detail below.
<.> inherits from link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/value/semantics/ValueSemanticsAbstract.html[ValueSemanticsAbstract], a convenience adapter.

* the `compose()` and `decompose()` methods are used to serialize the object using the structures defined by the link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/schema/about.html[XSD schemas].
+
Using this, the framework can render the composite value as JSON (as used by the REST API), or to XML, as used by SPIs such as link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/services/publishing/spi/CommandSubscriber.html#section-top[CommandSubscriber] (see link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/services/command/Command.html[Command] and link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/schema/cmd.html[CommandDto]).
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::ComplexNumberValueSemantics.java[tags=compose]
----

* the `getRenderer()` is used to render the value as a string.
An HTML representation can also be provided, though this type doesn't warrant one.
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::ComplexNumberValueSemantics.java[tags=getRenderer]
----

* the `getDefaultsProvider()` provides an initial value (eg non-nullable properties):
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::ComplexNumberValueSemantics.java[tags=getDefaultsProvider]
----

* Finally, the "default" mixin (mentioned above) defines an action to set the components of the value type.
The name "default" in this context is in effect a reserved method name.
+
[source,java]
.ComplexNumber_default.java
----
include::ComplexNumber_default.java[tags=default-mixin]
----
<.> should always specify the `INLINE_AS_IF_EDIT` prompt style, because the prompt may be "nested" within an outer action prompt (e.g. the `addComplexNumber` action of the page object iself)

Comparing composite value types to scalar value types, you'll notice that a composite type doesn't need to define a `Parser` implementation; instead the "default" mixin performs an equivalent role.

=== Integrating with an ORM

Be aware that if using the value type within an entity, then it will also be necessary to implement additional code to instruct the ORM how to convert the value type into the database.

The "embedded types" demo page shows how this can be done.
