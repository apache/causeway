The `associateWith` element specifies an action has a relationship with another property or another collection of the domain class.

* For properties, the association (currently) is used solely for layout purposes, so that the action will by default be rendered close to the property.
+
This can of course be overridden using `@ActionLayout` or the layout file

* For collections, the association is also used for layout purposes, rendering the action near to the collection.
+
However, it is also used at a deeper level, because the action may have a collection parameter which is the same type as the collection elements.
In the Wicket viewer, the collection is rendered with checkboxes; those selected objects are used as defaults for the action collection parameter.


== Associated with Properties

The `AssociateWithVm` class defines two properties, `text` and `anotherProperty`:

[source,java]
----
include::ActionAssociateWithVm.java[tags=class-properties]
----

The regular `updateText` action is associated with the `text` property:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::ActionAssociateWithVm.java[tags=action-associateWith-property]
----
<.> indicates the property to associate with
<.> if there are multiple actions associated with the property, indicates their order in the UI

Meanwhile the mixin `updateOtherProperty` is associated with the `otherProperty` property:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::ActionAssociateWithVm_updateOtherProperty.java[tags=class]
----
<.> indicates the property to associate with
<.> indicates their order in the UI


== Collection

The `AssociateWithVm` class also defines the `children` collection:

[source,java]
----
include::ActionAssociateWithVm.java[tags=class-collections-children]
----

There are three actions associated with this collection:

* the `addChild` action:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::ActionAssociateWithVm.java[tags=action-associateWith-children-1]
----
<.> associates with the "children" collection
<.> positioned first in the UI

* the `removeChild` action.
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::ActionAssociateWithVm.java[tags=action-associateWith-children-2]
----
<.> associates with the "children" collection
<.> positioned second in the UI
<.> because this action is associated with a collection, no supporting `choices()` or `autoComplete(...)` is required to provide the parameter.
Instead, the elements in the collection are automatically used.

+
TIP: an explicit `choices()` or `autoComplete(...)` supporting method can be provided to override the default usage of the collection elements if required.

* the `removeChildren` action, which allows multiple children to be removed:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::ActionAssociateWithVm.java[tags=action-associateWith-children-3]
----
<.> associates with the "children" collection
<.> positioned third in the UI
<.> again, no supporting `choices()` or `autoComplete(...)` method is required.
Instead, the elements of the collection are used as options.
Also, each row in the collection is rendered with a checkbox, and those selected are used as the default for the parameter.

== Mixin Actions

The `AssociateWithVm` class also defines the `favorites` collection:

[source,java]
----
include::ActionAssociateWithVm.java[tags=class-collections-favorites]
----

There are three mixin actions associated with this collection:

* the `makeFavorite` action.
This takes a element from the "children" collectio and also adds to the "favorites" collection:
+
[source,java]
----
include::child/ActionAssociateWithVm_makeFavorite.java[tags=class]
----
<.> associates with the "favorites" collection
<.> positioned first in the UI
<.> choices are taken from the "children" collection

* the `noLongerFavorite` action.
This just removes a selected element from the "children" collection:
+
[source,java]
----
include::child/ActionAssociateWithVm_noLongerFavorite.java[tags=class]
----
<.> associates with the "children" collection
<.> positioned second in the UI
<.> because this action is associated with a collection, no supporting `choices()` or `autoComplete(...)` is required to provide the parameter.
Instead, the elements in the collection are automatically used.

* the `noLongerFavorites` action.
This is similar to the previous action, but for multiple favorite elements:
+
[source,java]
----
include::child/ActionAssociateWithVm_noLongerFavorites.java[tags=class]
----
<.> associates with the "favorites" collection
<.> positioned third in the UI
<.> because this action is associated with a collection, no supporting `choices()` or `autoComplete(...)` is required to provide the parameter.
Instead, the elements in the collection are automatically used.
