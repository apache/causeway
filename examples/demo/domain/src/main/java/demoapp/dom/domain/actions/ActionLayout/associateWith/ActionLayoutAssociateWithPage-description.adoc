It's quite common for a domain object action to only change one part of a domain object's (visible) state.
For example, an action might be used to change a name, or a pair of actions be used to add or remove elements from a collection.
In such cases, it generally makes sense for the action's button to be close to the property or collection to which it relates.

One way to specify this is with the `.layout.xml` files, but another option is to use the link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-SNAPSHOT/applib/index/annotation/ActionLayout.html#associatewith[@ActionLayout#associateWith] element (along with link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-SNAPSHOT/applib/index/annotation/ActionLayout.html#associatewith[@ActionLayout#sequence] if there are several actions associated with the property/collection).

=== How this demo works

This page defines a `name` property, and a `children` collection:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::ActionLayoutAssociateWithPage.java[tags=class]
----

The `updateName` action only updates the `name` property, and so it makes sense to render its button close to this property.
This is done using `@Action#associateWith`:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::ActionLayoutAssociateWithPage.java[tags=associate-with-property]
----
<.> associates with the `name` property

Similarly, the `addChild` and `removeChild` actions both modify the `children` collection:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::ActionLayoutAssociateWithPage.java[tags=associate-with-collection]
----
<.> associates with the `children` collection
<.> uses `sequence` to specify the order on the page (left to right)

TIP: Note that it is also possible to associate an action with a collection using `Action#choicesFrom`,
which has the additional semantic of the rows of the element being used as choices for that actionâ€™s collection parameter
of the same type as the elements of the collection.


=== .layout.xml

Instead of using `@ActionLayout#associateWith`, it is also possible to associate actions with objects using the `<action id="..." cssClass="...">` in the link:https://causeway.apache.org/userguide/2.0.0-RC1/fun/ui.html#by-example[.layout.xml] file.

The general idea is that an action is associated with a property or collection by being nested inside the corresponding element:

* associating an action with (below) a property:
+
[source,xml]
.Xxx.layout.xml
----
...
<cpt:property id="...">
    <cpt:action id="..."/>
</cpt:property>
...
----

* associating an action with the panel of a property:
+
[source,xml]
.Xxx.layout.xml
----
...
<cpt:fieldSet id="...">
    <cpt:action id="..."/>
    <cpt:property id="..."/>
</cpt:fieldSet>
...
----
+
The terms "fieldSet" and "panel" are synonymous.

* associating an action with a collection:
+
[source,xml]
.Xxx.layout.xml
----
...
<cpt:collection id="...">
    <cpt:action id="..."/>
</cpt:collection>
...
----

* not associated with any member:
+
[source,xml]
.Xxx.layout.xml
----
...
<bs3:col span="12" unreferencedActions="true">
    <cpt:domainObject/>
    <cpt:action id="..."/>
</bs3:col>
...
----




One advantage of using the `.layout.xml` file is that changes can be picked up without having to restart the application.
