The "maxLength" semantic specifies the maximum length of the value that can be held by the property.
This corresponds to the number of characters that can be entered through the text field:

* for properties, the semantic can be specified using either the `@Property` annotation, or a meta-annotation

* for parameters, the semantic can be specified using either the `@Parameter` annotation, or a meta-annotation.

This semantic applies only to strings.

[IMPORTANT]
====
For domain entities this semantic should be accompanied with `@Column(maxLength=...)` so that the persistence layer implements the same constraint.
====

[NOTE]
====
`@Property#maxLength()` and `@PropertyLayout#typicalLength()` are not related - the first is a semantic that prevents the property from holding more than the specified number of characters, the latter is a layout hint relating to the size of the textfield.

== Annotated

The maxLength semantic can be specified explicitly using an annotation:

* for properties, using `@Property#maxLength()`:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::PropertyMaxLengthVm.java[tags=annotation]
----
<.> explicitly specifies the maximum length that can be entered for the property

* for parameters, using `@Parameter#maxLength()`:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::PropertyMaxLengthVm_updateWithParameterLayout.java[tags=annotation]
----
<.> explicitly specifies the maximum length that can be entered for the property

It could also be applied to mixin, but would have little effect because mixin properties are always read-only.

== Meta-annotated

The maxLength semantic can also be specified using a custom meta-annotation:

* the meta-annotation is defined as:
+
[source,java]
----
include::MaxLengthMetaAnnotation.java[tags=class]
----
<.> annotated for property ...
<.> \... and also for parameter.
<.> annotation can be applied to a property (either its getter or the field directly)
<.> annotation can be applied to a parameter
<.> annotation can be applied to a type (ie, meta-meta annotations recursively)

* and can be applied to a property:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::PropertyMaxLengthVm.java[tags=meta-annotated]
----
<.> semantic is inherited from the meta-annotation

* or can be applied to a parameter:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::PropertyMaxLengthVm_updateWithMetaAnnotation.java[tags=meta-annotation]
----
<.> semantic is inherited from the meta-annotation


=== Meta-annotated Overridden

The meta-annotation can itself be overridden:

* in a property:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::PropertyMaxLengthVm.java[tags=meta-annotated-overridden]
----
<.> semantic from meta-annotation ...
<.> \... is overridden by the `@Property` annotation

* or a parameter:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::PropertyMaxLengthVm_updateWithMetaAnnotationOverridden.java[tags=meta-annotation-overridden]
----
<.> semantic from meta-annotation ...
<.> \... is overridden by the `@Parameter` annotation
