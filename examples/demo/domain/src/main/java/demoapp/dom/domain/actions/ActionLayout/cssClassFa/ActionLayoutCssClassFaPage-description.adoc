To help the end-user navigate a page, it can sometimes be helpful to decorate individual actions within icons so that their purpose is more obvious.

The link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-SNAPSHOT/applib/index/annotation/ActionLayout.html#cssclassfa[@ActionLayout#cssClassFa] element allows this to be done by specifying the _Font Awesome_ CSS class (or classes) with which to decorate an action.
This is used for whether the action is rendered as a button or as a menu item.

=== How this demo works

This page has a `name` property and two actions, both of which can be used to update that property.
The two actions have different fa icons.

* `updateNameWithFaIconOnTheLeft`
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::ActionLayoutCssClassFaPage.java[tags=updateNameWithFaIconOnTheLeft]
----
<.> uses the `bus` icon for this action

* `updateNameWithFaIconOnTheRight`
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::ActionLayoutCssClassFaPage.java[tags=updateNameWithFaIconOnTheRight]
----
<.> use the `car` icon for this action
<.> and place the icon on the right (by default it is placed on the left)


in effect the icon is rendered on the _right_ of the action button


==== Related configuration property

Rather than styling each action individually, it's possible to use a configuration property which defines styles globally.

It works by specifying a set of `regex:cssClassFa` pairs; if the action's identifier matches the regex, then the fa icon is applied.
This is a great way to ensure that actions with similar semantics have similar names; they will then pick up the same visual cues.

The following is taken from this demo app:


[source,yaml]
.application.yml
----
causeway:

  applib:
    annotation:
      action-layout:
        css-class-fa:
          patterns:
            new.*:fa-plus,
            add.*:fa-plus-square,
            create.*:fa-plus,
            update.*:fa-edit,
            delete.*:fa-trash,
            find.*:fa-search,
            list.*:fa-list,
            all.*:fa-list,
            export.*:fa-file-export,
            import.*:fa-file-import
----


=== .layout.xml

Instead of using `@ActionLayout#cssClassFa`, it is also possible to specify the fa icon class using the `<action id="..." cssClass="...">` in the link:https://causeway.apache.org/userguide/2.0.0-RC1/fun/ui.html#by-example[.layout.xml] file.

One advantage of using the `.layout.xml` file is that changes can be picked up without having to restart the application.
