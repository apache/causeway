When dealing with date ranges, sometimes it can be easier to define ranges that use a combination of inclusive-exclusive limits -- that is `[startDate, endDate)` -- so that the dates within the range meet the constraint `startDate <= date < endDate`.

However, in the user interface your users may prefer inclusive ranges for both the _startDate_ _and_ the `endDate`.
To do that means that the rendered endDate must actually be for the _day before_ the date stored internally.

The link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-RC1/applib/index/annotation/ValueSemantics.html#daterenderadjustdays[@ValueSemantics#dateRenderAdjustDays] attribute can be used to accomplish this.

The attribute can be applied to both properties and parameters:




== How this demo works

This page has a `startDate` and an `endDate`, with the `endDate` (internally) set to one week (7 days) after the `startDate`.
The `endDate` can be changed by either action or as an editable property, but the value stored will be one day more than that entered.

WARNING: this functionality is currently *not* supported by the Wicket viewer; see link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAUSEWAY-3445[CAUSEWAY-3445].

In terms of code:

* the menu action initializes the start and end date as 7 days apart:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
.ValueSemanticsMenu.java
----
include::../ValueSemanticsMenu.java[tags=create-page]
----
<.> `endDate` set to +7 days from the `startDate`

* The `startDate` property has no annotations that would change the way in which it is rendered:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
.ValueSemanticsDateRenderAdjustDaysPage.java
----
include::ValueSemanticsDateRenderAdjustDaysPage.java[tags=render-not-specified]
----

* The `endDate` property however should show 1 day before this date:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
.ValueSemanticsDateRenderAdjustDaysPage_updateEndDate.java
----
include::ValueSemanticsDateRenderAdjustDaysPage_updateEndDate.java[tags=annotation]
----
<.> indicates that the value should render as one day _before_ the date actually stored.

* The `endDate` can also be updated using an action, also with adjusted days:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
.ValueSemanticsDateRenderAdjustDaysPage.java
----
include::ValueSemanticsDateRenderAdjustDaysPage.java[tags=render-as-day-before]
----
<.> render the internal date as the day before

* The derived `endDateNotAdjusted` however shows the internally held date:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
.ValueSemanticsDateRenderAdjustDaysPage.java
----
include::ValueSemanticsDateRenderAdjustDaysPage.java[tags=render-as-day]
----
<.> explicitly specifies that the property should be rendered "as is".

* You can also use the "download as XML" to inspect the "raw" data of the domain object:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
.ValueSemanticsDateRenderAdjustDaysPage_downloadAsXml.java
----
include::ValueSemanticsDateRenderAdjustDaysPage_downloadAsXml.java[tags=class]
----
