The `editing` semantic specifies that a property's value can be changed through the UI:

* for properties, the semantic can be specified using either the `@Property` annotation, or a meta-annotation

There is no corresponding semantic for parameters, parameters are implicitly editable.

== Class Level

Usually editing of properties is discouraged; it is usually better to modify state through an explicit action instead.
For that reason, editing of properties is disabled by default (though that can be changed globally if necessary using the `isis.applib.annotation.domain-object.editing` configuration property).

Editing can also be specified at the class level.
This will override any configured defaults, but just for the properties of that class:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::PropertyEditingVm.java[tags=class]
----

The property-level semantic can, in turn, overrides the configured or class-level default.


== Annotated

The `editing` semantic can be specified explicitly using an annotation:

* for properties, using `@Property#editing()`:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::PropertyEditingVm.java[tags=annotation]
----
<.> explicitly specifies that the property is editable

The annotation could also be applied to a mixin, but would have little effect because mixin properties are always read-only.

== Meta-annotated

The `editing` semantic can also be specified using a custom meta-annotation:

* the meta-annotation is defined as:
+
[source,java]
----
include::EditingEnabledMetaAnnotation.java[tags=class]
----
<.> annotated for a property
<.> annotation can be applied to a property (either its getter or the field directly)

* and can be applied to a property:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::PropertyEditingVm.java[tags=meta-annotated]
----
<.> semantic is inherited from the meta-annotation



=== Meta-annotated Overridden

The meta-annotation can itself be overridden:

* in a property:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::PropertyEditingVm.java[tags=meta-annotated-overridden]
----
<.> semantic from meta-annotation ...
<.> \... is overridden by the `@Property` annotation
