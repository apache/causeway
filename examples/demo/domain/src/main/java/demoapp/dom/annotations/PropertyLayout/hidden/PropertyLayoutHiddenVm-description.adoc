The `hidden` hint indicates that the property should be hidden in certain contexts.
Most commonly, this is to hide properties in tables (parented, standalone, or both).

* for properties, the hint can be specified using either the `@PropertyLayout` annotation, or a meta-annotation, or using the `Xxx.layout.xml` layout file.

* there is equivalent for a  parameter (though parameters can be hidden dynamically using a `hide...()` supporting method)

Because some of the `hidden` variants relate to tables, this view model has a collection of child objects with those child objects annotated to show the relevant options.
There is also an action that returns this same set of child objects as a standalone list.


== Annotated

The `hidden` hint can be specified explicitly using an annotation:

* for properties, using `@PropertyLayout#hidden()`:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::PropertyLayoutHiddenVm.java[tags=annotation]
----
<.> explicitly indicate that the property should be visible in all contexts.

Note that there is no equivalent for `@ParameterLayout`.

== Layout File

For properties (not parameters), the `hidden` hint can be specified using the `Xxx.layout.xml` file:

* property definition:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::PropertyLayoutHiddenVm.java[tags=layout-file]
----
<.> `hidden` hint is _not_ present.

* layout file snippet:
+
[source,xml,indent=0,tabsize=4]
----
<cpt:property id="propertyHiddenNowhereUsingLayout" hidden="NOWHERE"/>
----

One advantage of the layout file over the annotation is that the layout file is dynamic: it can be modified and the changes reloaded in a running application.

TIP: It is sometimes necessary to invoke the `Rebuild Metamodel` action to see this take effect.

== Variants

The table below lists the properties of this object, and the context (if any) in which it should be visible.

NOTE: there are other variants, the child object has all possible variants.

.Hidden Variants
[cols="^1m,2m,2a",options=header,frame="all"]
|===
^| Where
^| This object
^| Notes

| NOWHERE
| propertyHiddenNowhereUsingAnnotation
propertyHiddenNowhereUsingLayout
propertyUsingMetaAnnotationButOverridden
| Visible at all times

| EVERYWHERE
| propertyHiddenEverywhere
propertyUsingMetaAnnotation
| Should not be visible at all.

| ANYWHERE
| propertyHiddenAnywhere
| Should not be visible at all +
(synonym for EVERYWHERE)

|===

The source for the `propertyHiddenNowhereUsingAnnotation` property is quoted above; but the other two properties are:

* Everywhere:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::PropertyLayoutHiddenVm.java[tags=variants-everywhere]
----

* Anywhere:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::PropertyLayoutHiddenVm.java[tags=variants-anywhere]
----

Neither of these properties should be visible in the UI.


== Meta-annotated

The `hidden` hint can also be specified using a custom meta-annotation:

* the meta-annotation is defined as:
+
[source,java]
----
include::HiddenEverywhereMetaAnnotation.java[tags=class]
----
<.> annotated for property .
<.> annotation can be applied to a property (either its getter or the field directly)
<.> annotation can be applied to a parameter
<.> annotation can be applied to a type (ie, meta-meta annotations recursively)

* and can be applied to a property:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::PropertyLayoutHiddenVm.java[tags=meta-annotated]
----
<.> hint is inherited from the meta-annotation

* or can be applied to mixin:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::PropertyLayoutHiddenVm_mixinPropertyWithMetaAnnotation.java[tags=class]
----
<.> hint is inherited from the meta-annotation

Neither of these properties should be visible in the UI.

=== Meta-annotated Overridden

The meta-annotation can itself be overridden:

* in a property:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::PropertyLayoutHiddenVm.java[tags=meta-annotated-overridden]
----
<.> hint from meta-annotation ...
<.> \... is overridden by the `@PropertyLayout` annotation


* or a mixin:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::PropertyLayoutHiddenVm_mixinPropertyWithMetaAnnotationOverridden.java[tags=meta-annotation-overridden]
----
<.> hint from meta-annotation ...
<.> \... is overridden by the `@ParameterLayout` annotation

In both cases, even though the meta-annotation indicates that the property should be hidden everywhere, the override indicates that they should be hidden nowhere.
Both properties should therefore be visible in the UI.

== Children

The `children` collection illustrates the visibility of the child objects' properties when viewed in a collection:

* the `propertyHiddenObjectForms` property is visible as a column in the collection, but won't be visible in the object's page itself

* the `propertyHiddenStandalone` property similarly is visible here, but won't be visible in the standalone list returned by the "returns children" action

* the `propertyHiddenNowhere` property similar is visible here, and will also be visible on the object's page.

The child object has a number of other properties, each using a different `hidden` variant; click through to inspect.
