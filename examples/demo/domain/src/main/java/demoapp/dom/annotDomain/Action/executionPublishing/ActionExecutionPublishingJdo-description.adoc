WARNING: TODO publishing was renamed to executionPublishing

The `publishing` semantic specifies that the invocation of an object action should be published to registered implementation(s) of link:https://isis.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-M3/applib-svc/PublisherService.html#spi[`PublisherService` SPI].
This is performed _after_ the action has been invoked.

The publishing from the framework to the SPI is in-memory.
A typical SPI implementation would then publish over the network, or perhaps store in a database.
(Note that the framework provides an link:https://isis.apache.org/mappings/2.0.0-M3/outbox-publisher/about.html[out-of-the-box implementation] of the link:https://microservices.io/patterns/data/transactional-outbox.html[outbox pattern]).

The semantic can be specified using either the `@Action` annotation, or through a meta-annotation.

NOTE: The demo shows publishing of entities, as this is much more common use case than publishing a view model.

== Annotated

The `publisher` semantic can be specified explicitly using an annotation through `@Action#publishing()`:

* it can be applied to an action:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::ActionPublishingJdo.java[tags=annotation]
----
<.> explicitly specifies that invoking the action should be published.

* or to a mixin:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::ActionPublishingJdo_mixinUpdateProperty.java[tags=class]
----
<.> explicitly specifies that invoking the mixin action should be published.


== Meta-annotated

The `publishing` semantic can also be specified using a custom meta-annotation:

* the meta-annotation is defined as:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::ActionPublishingEnabledMetaAnnotation.java[tags=class]
----
<.> annotated for an action
<.> annotation can be applied to an action method or to a mixin

* and can be applied to an action:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::ActionPublishingJdo.java[tags=meta-annotation]
----
<.> semantic is inherited from the meta-annotation

* or to a mixin:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::ActionPublishingJdo_mixinUpdatePropertyMetaAnnotation.java[tags=class]
----
<.> semantic is inherited from the meta-annotation


=== Meta-annotated Overridden

The meta-annotation can itself be overridden:

* for an action:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::ActionPublishingJdo.java[tags=meta-annotation-overridden]
----
<.> semantic from meta-annotation ...
<.> \... is overridden by the `@Action` annotation

* or on a mixin:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::ActionPublishingJdo_mixinUpdatePropertyMetaAnnotationOverridden.java[tags=class]
----
<.> semantic from meta-annotation ...
<.> \... is overridden by the `@Action` annotation


== PublisherService

The demo provides a simple implementation of `PublisherService` that just stores the DTOs in memory:

[source,java]
----
include::spiimpl/PublisherServiceSpiForActions.java[tags=class]
----
<.> serializes to `InteractionDto`, as defined by the link:https://isis.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-M3/schema/ixn.html[Apache Isis schema].

The demo implementation also provides a way to query these executions:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::spiimpl/PublisherServiceSpiForActions.java[tags=demo]
----

Supporting mixins surface this list as contributions on the object:

* `interactionExecutions` collection:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::spiimpl/ActionPublishingJdo_interactionExecutions.java[tags=class]
----

* `clearInteractionExecutions` action:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::spiimpl/ActionPublishingJdo_clearInteractionExecutions.java[tags=class]
----


== Configuration

By default, publishing of action invocations is disabled.
This can be configured globally:

[source,yaml]
.application.yml
----
isis:
  applib:
    annotation:
      action:
        publishing: none
----

In addition to globally enabling or disabling action publishing, it is also possible to specify `ignore_safe`.

This enables publishing for all actions except those that have safe (that is, query-only) semantics.
In other words actions are published except for those that don't change (aren't declared as changing) the state of the system.
