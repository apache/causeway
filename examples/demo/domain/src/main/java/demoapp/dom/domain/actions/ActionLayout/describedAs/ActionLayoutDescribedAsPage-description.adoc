Often the end-user of your application will be a frequent user and will know by sight the purpose of the various properties, collections and actions that are displayed.
But, for less experienced users, or for new features, the link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-SNAPSHOT/applib/index/annotation/ActionLayout.html#describedas[@ActionLayout#describedAs] allows you to provide brief additional information about all object members.

For an action button, this description is displayed as a tooltip.


=== How this demo works

This page has a `name` property and a `children` collection.
It also has with a number of actions, with the actions each having descriptions.
The actions are associated with members and positioned so that they appear in different places in the UI.

* action associated with the `name` property and positioned below that property:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::ActionLayoutDescribedAsPage.java[tags=below]
----
<.> in effect adds a tooltip to this action's button, that shows on _mouse over_

* action associated with the `name` property and positioned on its parent panel:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::ActionLayoutDescribedAsPage.java[tags=panel]
----
<.> in effect adds a tooltip to this action's button, that shows on _mouse over_

* action associated with the `name` property and positioned as panel drop-down:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::ActionLayoutDescribedAsPage.java[tags=panel-dropdown]
----
<.> in effect adds a tooltip to this action's button, that shows on _mouse over_

* actions associated with the `children` collection:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::ActionLayoutDescribedAsPage.java[tags=collection]
----
<.> in effect adds a tooltip to this action's button, that shows on _mouse over_

* actions not associated with any member (appear at the top)
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::ActionLayoutDescribedAsPage.java[tags=delete]
----
<.> in effect adds a tooltip to this action's button, that shows on _mouse over_

In addition, actions that appear in menus can also have descriptions; for example, the menu item used to obtain this page:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../ActionLayoutMenu.java[tags=menu-item-described-as]
----


=== .layout.xml

Instead of using `@ActionLayout#describesAs`, it is also possible to specify a tooltip using the `<action id="..." describedAs="...">` in the link:https://causeway.apache.org/userguide/2.0.0-RC1/fun/ui.html#by-example[.layout.xml] file.

One advantage of using the `.layout.xml` file is that changes can be picked up without having to restart the application.
On the other hand, including descriptions can make that file rather large.
