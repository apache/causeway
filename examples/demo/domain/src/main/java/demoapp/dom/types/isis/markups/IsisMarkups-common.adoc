== Mixin actions

A number of mixin actions contribute through the `IsisMarkupHolder` interface, demonstrate the use of `Markup` as a parameter and as a return type.
For example:

* the `updateReadOnlyProperty` action is:
+
[source,java]
----
include::holder/IsisMarkupHolder_updateReadOnlyProperty.java[tags=class]
----

* the `updateReadOnlyOptionalProperty` action is:
+
[source,java]
----
include::holder/IsisMarkupHolder_updateReadOnlyOptionalProperty.java[tags=class]
----

* the `actionReturning` action is:
+
[source,java]
----
include::holder/IsisMarkupHolder_actionReturning.java[tags=class]
----


* the `actionReturningCollection` action is:
+
[source,java]
----
include::holder/IsisMarkupHolder_actionReturningCollection.java[tags=class]
----

== Mixin properties

We also use the interface to contribute a mixin property:

* the `mixinProperty` property:
+
[source,java]
----
include::holder/IsisMarkupHolder_mixinProperty.java[tags=class]
----


== @PropertyLayout(labelPosition=...)

There is also an extended interface, `IsisMarkupHolder2`, with default methods demonstrating the use of label positions:

[source,java]
----
include::holder/IsisMarkupHolder2.java[tags=class]
----

<.> The default methods have annotations that are automatically inherited.
<.> Position to the left
<.> Uses `@MemberOrder` positions the properties into the appropriate `<field-set>` within the `Xxx.layout.xml` layout file.
<.> Position label on top
<.> Position label to the right
+
CAUTION: currently not supported
<.> Hide the label compleely.
