== Mixin actions

A number of mixin actions contribute through the `JavaTimeLocalTimeHolder` interface, demonstrate the use of `java.time.LocalTime` as a parameter and as a return type.
For example:

* the `upReadOnlyProperty` action is:
+
[source,java]
----
include::holder/JavaTimeLocalTimeHolder_updateReadOnlyProperty.java[tags=class]
----

* the `upReadOnlyOptionalProperty` action is:
+
[source,java]
----
include::holder/JavaTimeLocalTimeHolder_updateReadOnlyOptionalProperty.java[tags=class]
----

* the `actionReturning` action is:
+
[source,java]
----
include::holder/JavaTimeLocalTimeHolder_actionReturning.java[tags=class]
----


* the `actionReturningCollection` action is:
+
[source,java]
----
include::holder/JavaTimeLocalTimeHolder_actionReturningCollection.java[tags=class]
----

== Mixin properties

We also use the interface to contribute a mixin property:

* the `mixinProperty` property:
+
[source,java]
----
include::holder/JavaTimeLocalTimeHolder_mixinProperty.java[tags=class]
----


== @PropertyLayout(labelPosition=...)

To demonstrate support for label positions using `@PropertyLayout(labelPosition=...)`, the entity and view model objects both implement the extended `JavaTimeLocalTimeHolder2` interface:

[source,java]
----
include::holder/JavaTimeLocalTimeHolder2.java[tags=class]
----

<.> The default methods have annotations that are automatically inherited.
<.> Position to the left
<.> Using `@PropertyLayout(fieldSetId=...)` positions the properties into the appropriate `<field-set>` within the `Xxx.layout.xml` layout file.
<.> Position label on top
<.> Position label to the right
+
CAUTION: currently not supported
<.> Hide the label compleely.

== @PropertyLayout(renderDay=...)

To demonstrate support for `@PropertyLayout(renderDay=...)` -- to simplify the modelling "[inclusive, exclusive)"  ranges -- the entity and view model objects both implement the extended `JavaTimeLocalTimeHolder3` interface.
All methods have a default implementation:

[source,java]
----
include::holder/JavaTimeLocalTimeHolder3.java[tags=class]
----

<.> Render the value as the day before
<.> Render the value unchanged
<.> Render the value as the day before
