The framework has built-in support for  the `String` data type.
These can be used either in entities or view models.

== How this demo works

On the left hand side is a collection of entities that uses the `String` datatype.
There is also an action that opens a view model; this view model also uses the `String` datatype.

Navigate into the entity or view model to see the datatype used as a property, an action parameter and as a return type of collections, along with code samples.

=== Implementation Notes

The entity and view model types both implement some common interfaces:

* The `JavaLangStringHolder` interface is used to contribute a number of mixins to both types:
+
[source,java]
----
include::holder/JavaLangStringHolder.java[tags=class]
----

* The `JavaLangStringHolder2` interface is used to demonstrate support for label positions using `@PropertyLayout(labelPosition=...)`.

Further details, along with the effect of this annotation, can be seen on the entity and view model object pages.
