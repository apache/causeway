Every action invocation is reified into a link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-SNAPSHOT/applib/index/services/command/Execution.html[Execution] which captures the target and action arguments, and its outcome, as well as the "who" and the "when" (identity of the user performing the action and a timestamp).

The link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-SNAPSHOT/applib/index/annotation/Action.html#commandpublishing[@Action#executionPublishing] determines whether subscribers are notified of the action being executed.

The _executionLog_ extension provides an out-of-the-box subscriber implementation that persists every published execution into a log.
This can be invaluable for auditing and performance monitoring.

The similar _executionOutbox_ extension (not part of this demo) is very similar, also persisting executions.
It is designed for integration scenarios, interacting with downstream systems.

It is of course also possible to register additional subscribers for your own purposes.


=== How this demo works

The collection on the left hand side shows a list of entities, and three associated actions.
These actions can be used to change the name of any one of those entities.

* the `changeNamePublished` action has execution publishing enabled.
+
This will result in an execution representing the action invocation from being persisted as an `ExecutionLogEntry`; these are listed in the collection at the bottom of the page.
The execution of one of the actions is published, the other is not.

* the `changeNameNotPublished` action has execution publishing disabled.
+
As you might expect, no `ExecutionLogEntry` is persisted for this.

* the `changeNameWrapped` action also has execution publishing enabled, but is implemented by invoking a corresponding "changeName" action on the underlying entity, through the `WrapperFactory`
+
This results in executions for both the outer action and the delegate action both being published, with a corresponding `ExecutionLogEntry` for both.

You can also navigate into the entities and invoke actions on the objects themselves.
These actions are also logged.

In terms of code:

* action with execution publishing enabled:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
.ActionExecutionPublishingPage_changeNamePublished.java
----
include::ActionExecutionPublishingPage_changeNamePublished.java[tags=class]
----
<.> enables execution publishing

* action with execution publishing enabled, but which delegates to the entity using `WrapperFactory`:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
.ActionExecutionPublishingPage_changeNameWrapped.java
----
include::ActionExecutionPublishingPage_changeNameWrapped.java[tags=class]
----
<.> enables execution publishing
<.> delegates to entity via `WrapperFactory`

* contributed collection showing persisted ``ExecutionLogEntry``s:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
.ActionExecutionPublishingPage_publishedExecutions.java
----
include::ActionExecutionPublishingPage_publishedExecutions.java[tags=class]
----
<.> repository provided by the _executionLog_ extension.

causeway:
  applib:
    annotation:
      action:
        execution-publishing: "none"      # <.>
----
<.> `none` | `disabled` | `enabled`.
