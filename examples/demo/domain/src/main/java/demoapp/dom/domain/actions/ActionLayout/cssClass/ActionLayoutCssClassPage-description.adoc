To help the end-user navigate a page, it can sometimes be helpful to style individual actions so that their purpose is more obvious.

The link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-SNAPSHOT/applib/index/annotation/ActionLayout.html#cssclass[@ActionLayout#cssClass] allows a CSS style (or styles) to be defined.

One option is to reference a style that you have defined yourself in the `application.css` file.
Alternatively, you can exploit the fact that the Wicket viewer uses the link:https://getbootstrap.com/[bootstrap] design system, and so just use one of the styles defined there, for example, the link:https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/buttons/#button-tags[button tags]


=== How this demo works

This page defines a single `name` property along with a set of actions, all of which can be used to update that property.
Those actions are rendered in a number of different positions, all using a different _Bootstrap_ class.

==== Positioned below the property

Two actions:

* `btn-info`:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::ActionLayoutCssClassPage.java[tags=below-btn-info]
----
<.> appends the `btn-info` CSS class to the action's button, in effect rendering it with _Bootstrap_ `Info` style
<.> when an action is associated with a property, then by default it is rendered below that property; so strictly speaking this element is not required.

* and `btn-warning`:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::ActionLayoutCssClassPage.java[tags=below-btn-warning]
----
<.> appends the `btn-warning` CSS class to the action's button, in effect rendering it with _Bootstrap_ `Warning` style
<.> specifies the order in which associated actions in the same position are rendered


==== Positioned on the panel that contains the property

Two actions:

* `btn-primary`:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::ActionLayoutCssClassPage.java[tags=panel-btn-primary]
----
<.> appends the `btn-primary` CSS class
<.> positions on the containing panel.
(The panel is called the `<fieldset>` if using `.layout.xml`).

* and `btn-secondary`:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::ActionLayoutCssClassPage.java[tags=panel-btn-secondary]
----
<.> appends the `btn-warning` CSS class to the action's button, in effect rendering it with _Bootstrap_ `Warning` style
<.> specifies the order in which associated actions in the same position are rendered


==== Positioned on the drop-down of the panel that contains the property:

WARNING: although the CSS class is applied, the Bootstrap styling does not apply; see link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAUSEWAY-3427[CAUSEWAY-3427].

Two actions:

* `btn-light`:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::ActionLayoutCssClassPage.java[tags=panel-dropdown-btn-light]
----
<.> appends the `btn-light` CSS class
<.> positions on the drop-down of the panel.

* and `btn-dark`:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::ActionLayoutCssClassPage.java[tags=panel-dropdown-btn-dark]
----
<.> appends the `btn-dark` CSS class

==== At the object level

One action:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::ActionLayoutCssClassPage.java[tags=delete]
----
<.> not explicitly positioned

Yhis last example has no `@ActionLayout#cssClass` defined, but it nevertheless will be rendered with the _Bootstrap_ "btn-danger" class.
This is because it picks up the global configuration property, as described in the next section.


=== Related configuration properties

Rather than styling each action individually, it's possible to use a configuration property which defines styles globally.

It works by specifying a set of `regex:cssClass` pairs; if the action's identifier matches the regex, then the CSS class is applied.
This is a great way to ensure that actions with similar semantics have similar names; they will then pick up the same visual cues.

The following is taken from this demo app:

[source,yaml]
.application.yml
----
causeway:
  applib:
    annotation:
      action-layout:
        css-class:
          patterns:
            delete.*:btn-danger     <.>
----
<.> This is a comma separated field.

This is the reason why the "delete" action (shown in the previous section) is rendered using "btn-danger".


=== .layout.xml

Instead of using `@ActionLayout#cssClass`, it is also possible to specify the CSS class using the `<action id="..." cssClass="...">` in the link:https://causeway.apache.org/userguide/2.0.0-RC1/fun/ui.html#by-example[.layout.xml] file.

One advantage of using the `.layout.xml` file is that changes can be picked up without having to restart the application.
