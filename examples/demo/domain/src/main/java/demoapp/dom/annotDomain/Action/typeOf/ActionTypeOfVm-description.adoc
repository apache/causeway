The `typeOf` semantic indicates the element type for an action that returns a collection.

Normally this can be inferred from the generic type, for example `Customer` within `List<Customer>`.
This annotation offers an alternative syntax.

CAUTION: this annotation may be deprecated in the future.

// TODO: I have a suspicion that there is a genuine use case for this annotation ... but need to dig deeper.

== Example

The demo object defines a `children` collection:

[source,java]
----
include::ActionTypeOfVm.java[tags=class-collections-children]
----

The `find` action returns a standalone collection for a subset of these child objects matching the specified value:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::ActionTypeOfVm.java[tags=action]
----
<.> indicates the type of element in the returned list
<.> action defines a raw list

That said, the `findButWithNoAnnotation` action has identical behaviour, even without the `typeOf` semantic:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::ActionTypeOfVm.java[tags=action-no-annotation]
----
<.> action defines a raw list
