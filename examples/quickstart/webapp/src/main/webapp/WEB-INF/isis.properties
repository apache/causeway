#################################################################################

#
# Specify the domain services.
# 
# These are the most important configuration properties in the system, as they define
# the set of the classes for Isis to instantiate as domain service singletons.
# From these domain service instances the rest of the metamodel is discovered, while the 
# end-user gains access to other domain objects by invoking the actions of the domain services.
#
# The implementations depend on the configured objectstore. 
#


# if using the in-memory object store:
# (also edit isis.persistor below, and edit pom.xml)
isis.services.prefix = objstore.dflt
isis.services = todo.ToDoItemsDefault


# if using the SQL object store:
# (also edit isis.persistor below, and edit pom.xml)
#isis.services.prefix = objstore.sql
#isis.services = todo.ToDoItemsSql


# if using the mongodb object store:
# (also edit isis.persistor below, and edit pom.xml)
#isis.services.prefix = objstore.mongodb
#isis.services = todo.ToDoItemsMongo




#
# Specify the (optional) test fixtures
#
# Fixtures are used to seed the object store with an initial set of data.  For the 
# in-memory object store, the fixtures are installed on every run.  For other
# object stores, they are used only when the object store is first initialized.
#
isis.fixtures.prefix= fixture
isis.fixtures= todo.ToDoItemsFixture


#################################################################################
#
# specify system components.
#
# The values correspond to the named components in the installer-registry.properties file
# in the org.apache.isis.runtimes.dflt:runtime JAR (in the org.apache.isis.runtimes.dflt.runtime package)
#
# Although all configuration could reside in isis.properties, the recommendation is
# to split out into component specific files:
# 
#    xxx_yyy.properties files
#
# where
#    * xxx is the component type, and
#    * yyy is the component name.
#
# For example, persistor_sql.properties holds configuration information specific to the
#
#
# If the components are changed, also remember to edit pom.xml (further comments can be 
# found in the persistor_xxx.properties files)

#
# configure authorization mechanism to use

# The authorization mechanism define each users' permissions to view/edit object properties 
# or collections, and to view/invoke object actions

# >>>
# >>> NB: authorization also requires a "facet decorator" to be installed, 
# >>> see 'miscellaneous' settings below.

#
# configure the persistor (object store) to use
#
# * in-memory   requires no additional configuration, but stores object in-memory 
#               and so is only suitable for prototyping
# * mongodb     uses MongDB to be persist objects as JSON documents.  It requires MongoDB
#               to be installed first (see persistor_mongodb.properties) 
# * sql         uses an RDBMS to persist objects as table rows.  It requires a suitable RDBMS
#               supporting JDBC to be installed (see persistor_sql.properties)
#
# also edit isis.services (above) and pom.xml
# 

isis.persistor=in-memory
#isis.persistor=mongodb

#
# enable Isis' built-in support for lazy loading/object dirtying.
#
# This configuration causes every domain entity to be "enhanced" so that objects graphs
# can be traversed transparent, and modified objects are automatically saved back to the
# object store.
#
# Note that this setting isn't required by some persistors (though it is required for the 
# in-memory, mongodb and sql persistors listed above)

#
# enable class substitution in the meta model
#
# The reflector (Isis metamodel) must be instructed to ignore the side-effects of enabling lazy-loading;
# specifically it ignores any cglib-generated subclasses.
