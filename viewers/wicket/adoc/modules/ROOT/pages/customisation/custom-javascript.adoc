The Wicket viewer ships with embedded JQuery, so this can be leveraged, for example to perform arbitrary transformations of the rendered page on page load.

To register your JavaScript code, then just specify the appropriate configuration property:


[source,properties]
----
isis.viewer.wicket.application.js=stylesheets/myapp.js
----

This file is resolved relative to `src/main/webapp`.

Currently only one such `.js` file can be registered.


[WARNING]
====
Just because something is possible, it doesn't necessarily mean we encourage it.
Please be aware that there is no formal API for any custom JavaScript that you might implement to target; future versions of Apache Isis might break your code.

As an alternative, consider using the `ComponentFactory` API described in the xref:vw:ROOT:extending.adoc[Extending] chapter.
