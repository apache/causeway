The Wicket viewer ships with embedded JQuery, so this can be leveraged, for example to perform arbitrary transformations of the rendered page on page load.

Similar to the xref:customisation.adoc#custom-css[application.css] file, the Wicket viewer automatically serves the `scripts/application.js` javascript file in every page load.
This is relative to the `static` package, under `src/main/resources`.
Currently only one such `.js` file can be registered.

If you wish to change the location of the file, use the xref:refguide:config:sections/isis.viewer.wicket.adoc#isis.viewer.wicket.application.js[isis.viewer.wicket.application.js] configuration property.


[WARNING]
====
Just because something is possible, it doesn't necessarily mean we encourage it.
Please be aware that there is no formal API for any custom JavaScript that you might implement to target; future versions of Apache Isis might break your code.

As an alternative, consider using the `ComponentFactory` API described in the xref:vw:ROOT:extending.adoc[extending] chapter.
