The Wicket viewer allows you to customize the GUI in several (progressively more sophisticated) ways:

* the xref:vw:ROOT:customisation.adoc[customisation] chapter described:

** by xref:vw:ROOT:customisation.adoc#tweaking-css-classes[tweaking the UI using CSS]
** by xref:vw:ROOT:customisation.adoc#custom-javascript[tweaking the UI using JavaScript]

* in this chapter we have a number of heavier-weight approaches:

** by writing a xref:vw:ROOT:extending.adoc#custom-bootstrap-theme[custom bootstrap theme]
** by xref:vw:ROOT:extending.adoc#replacing-page-elements[replacing elements of the page] using the `ComponentFactory` interface
** by implementing xref:vw:ROOT:extending.adoc#custom-pages[replacement page implementations] for the standard page types

The chapter also includes a technique useful when prototyping, allowing xref:vw:ROOT:extending.adoc#login-via-query-args-prototyping[user/passwords to be specified as query arguments].
