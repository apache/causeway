The Wicket viewer supports two different styles of dialog prompts for actions that have parameters: as a sidebar, and as a (movable) modal dialog.

* The sidebar prompt style looks like this:
+
image::dialog-mode/sidebar.png[width="600px"]

* while the modal dialog looks like:
+
image::dialog-mode/modal.png[width="600px"]

The sidebar is the default prompt style, and its benefit is that it doesn't obscure the rest of the information shown on the page; it also doesn't interrupt the end-user's context so much (they are more likely to remember why they invoked the action).

The xref:refguide:config:sections/isis.viewer.wicket.adoc#isis.viewer.wicket.prompt-style[isis.viewer.wicket.prompt-style] can be used to change the default style if required.
