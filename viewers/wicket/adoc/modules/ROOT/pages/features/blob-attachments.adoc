The Apache Isis application library provides the xref:refguide:applib-cm:value-types.adoc#Blob[Blob] value type (binary large objects) and also the xref:refguide:applib-cm:value-types.adoc#Clob[Clob]
value type (character large object), each of which also includes metadata about the data (specifically the filename and mime type).

A class can define a property using either of these types, for example:




== Screenshots

The following screenshots are taken from the example https://github.com/apache/isis-app-todoapp[TodoApp]:



=== View mode, empty

`Blob` field rendered as attachment (with no data):

image::blob-attachments/010-attachment-field-940.png[width="800px"]

Note that this screenshot show an earlier version of the xref:vw:ROOT:about.adoc[Wicket viewer] UI (specifically, pre 1.8.0).


=== Edit mode

Hit edit; 'choose file' button appears:

image::blob-attachments/020-edit-choose-file-940.png[width="800px"]



=== Choose file

Choose file using the regular browser window:

image::blob-attachments/030-choose-file-using-browser-520.png[width="520px"]


Chosen file is indicated:

image::blob-attachments/040-edit-chosen-file-indicated-940.png[width="800px"]



=== Image rendered

Back in view mode (ie once hit OK) if the `Blob` is an image, then it is shown:

image::blob-attachments/050-ok-if-image-then-rendered-940.png[width="800px"]



=== Download

`Blob` can be downloaded:

image::blob-attachments/060-download-940.png[width="800px"]



=== Clear

Back in edit mode, can choose a different file or clear (assuming property is not mandatory):

== Domain Code

To define a `Blob`, use:

[source,java]
----
private Blob attachment;
@javax.jdo.annotations.Persistent(defaultFetchGroup="false")
    @javax.jdo.annotations.Persistent(defaultFetchGroup="false", columns = {
            @javax.jdo.annotations.Column(name = "attachment_name"),
            @javax.jdo.annotations.Column(name = "attachment_mimetype"),
            @javax.jdo.annotations.Column(name = "attachment_bytes", jdbcType = "BLOB", sqlType = "BLOB")
    })
@Property(
        domainEvent = AttachmentDomainEvent.class,
        optionality = Optionality.OPTIONAL
)
public Blob getAttachment() { return attachment; }
public void setAttachment(final Blob attachment) { this.attachment = attachment; }
----

To define a `Clob`, use:

[source,java]
----
private Clob doc;
@javax.jdo.annotations.Persistent(defaultFetchGroup="false", columns = {
        @javax.jdo.annotations.Column(name = "doc_name"),
        @javax.jdo.annotations.Column(name = "doc_mimetype"),
        @javax.jdo.annotations.Column(name = "doc_chars", jdbcType = "CLOB", sqlType = "CLOB")
})
@Property(
        optionality = Optionality.OPTIONAL
)
public Clob getDoc() { return doc; }
public void setDoc(final Clob doc) { this.doc = doc; }
----

The `Blob` and `Clob` types can also be used as parameters to actions.
