The Wicket viewer provides the ability for users to sign-up by providing a valid email address:

* from the login page the user can instead follow a link to take them to a sign-up page, where they enter their email address.
* a verification email is sent using this service; the email includes a link back to the running application.
* the user then completes the registration process by choosing a user name and password.
* the Wicket viewer then creates an account for them and logs them in.

In a similar way, if the user has forgotten their password then they can request a reset link to be sent to their email, again by providing their email address.

To support this the framework requires three services to be registered and configured:

* the xref:refguide:applib:index/services/userreg/UserRegistrationService.adoc[user registration service], which provides an API to create the user account
* the xref:refguide:applib:index/services/userreg/EmailNotificationService.adoc[email notification service], which provides an API for to send the verification emails
* the xref:refguide:applib:index/services/email/EmailService.adoc[email service], that is used by the email notification service to actually send the email.

The Apache Isis core framework provides a default implementation of both the email notification service and the email service.
The xref:security:ROOT:about.adoc[Security Manager] extension provides a partial implementation of xref:refguide:applib:index/services/userreg/UserRegistrationService.adoc[user registration service] that you can complete for your own applications.

== Configuration

There are two prerequisites:

* register an implementation of the xref:refguide:applib:index/services/userreg/UserRegistrationService.adoc[user registration service]
+
The xref:security:ROOT:about.adoc[SecMan extension] provides an abstract subclass implementation that does most of the work.

* configure the xref:refguide:applib:index/services/email/EmailService.adoc[email service]
+
This is required by the default xref:refguide:applib:index/services/userreg/EmailNotificationService.adoc[email notification service].

It is also possible to configure the Wicket viewer to suppress the sign-up page link and/or the password reset page, see xref:vw:ROOT:setup-and-configuration.adoc#sign-in-sign-up-and-remember-me[here] for further details.
