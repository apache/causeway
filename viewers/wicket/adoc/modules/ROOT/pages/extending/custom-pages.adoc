In the vast majority of cases customization should be sufficient by xref:vw:ROOT:extending.adoc#replacing-page-elements[replacing elements of a page].
However, it is also possible to define an entirely new page for a given page type.

The Wicket viewer defines these page types (see the `org.apache.isis.viewer.wicket.model.models.PageType` enum):

.PageType enum
[cols="1,4", options="header"]
|===
| Page type
| Renders

| SIGN_IN
| The initial sign-in (aka login) page

| SIGN_UP
| The sign-up page (if xref:refguide:applib:index/services/userreg/UserRegistrationService.adoc[user registration] is enabled).

| SIGN_UP_VERIFY
| The sign-up verification page (if xref:refguide:applib:index/services/userreg/UserRegistrationService.adoc[user registration] is enabled; as accessed by link from verification email)

| PASSWORD_RESET
| The password reset page (if enabled).

| HOME
| The home page, displaying either the welcome message or dashboard

| HOME_AFTER_PAGETIMEOUT
| Variation on home page after a timeout.

| ABOUT
| The about page, accessible from link top-right

| ENTITY
| Renders a single entity or view model

| STANDALONE_COLLECTION
| Page rendered after invoking an action that returns a collection of entites

| VALUE
| After invoking an action that returns a value type (though not URLs or Blob/Clobs, as these are handled appropriately automatically).

| VOID_RETURN
| After invoking an action that is `void`

| ACTION_PROMPT
| (No longer used).

|===


The `PageClassList` interface declares which class (subclass of `org.apache.wicket.Page` is used to render for each of these types.
For example, Apache Isis' `WicketSignInPage` renders the signin page.

To specify a different page class, create a new implementation of `PageClassList` and annotate with an earlier precedence than the default.
If you are just tweaking the defaults, then its easiest to override `PageClassListDefault`:

[source,java]
----
@Service
@Order(OrderPrecedence.EARLY)
public class MyPageClassList extends PageClassListDefault {
    protected Class<? extends Page> getSignInPageClass() {
        return MySignInPage.class;
    }
}
----
