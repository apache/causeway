The xref:vro:ROOT:about.adoc[REST API (Restful Objects viewer)] does *not* provide a login page.
Instead it defines the authentication strategy SPI, delegated to by a filter.
(For more detail on how this is wired together, see the implementation of the xref:refguide:viewer:index/restfulobjects/viewer/webmodule/WebModuleRestfulObjects.adoc[WebModuleRestfulObjects] web module service).

The SPI is:

* xref:refguide:viewer:index/restfulobjects/viewer/webmodule/auth/AuthenticationStrategy.adoc[AuthenticationStrategy]

where the returned xref:refguide:applib:index/services/iactnlayer/InteractionContext.adoc[InteractionContext] represents a signed-on user.


The strategy is defined using this configuration property:

* xref:refguide:config:sections/causeway.viewer.restfulobjects.adoc#causeway.viewer.restfulobjects.authentication.strategy-class-name[causeway.viewer.restfulobjects.authentication.strategy-class-name]


The framework currently provides only HTTP Basic Auth support as a simple implementation, this is also the default strategy if none is explicitly configured.
