The xref:vro:ROOT:about.adoc[REST API (Restful Objects viewer)] does *not* provide a login page.
Instead it defines the authentication strategy SPI, delegated to by a filter.
(For more detail on how this is wired together, see xref:refguide:viewer:index/restfulobjects/jaxrsresteasy4/webmodule/WebModuleJaxrsResteasy4.adoc[WebModuleJaxrsResteasy4].)

The SPI is:

* xref:refguide:viewer:index/restfulobjects/viewer/webmodule/auth/AuthenticationSessionStrategy.adoc[AuthenticationSessionStrategy]

where xref:refguide:core:index/security/authentication/Authentication.adoc[Authentication] represents a signed-on user:


The strategy is defined using this configuration property:

* xref:refguide:config:sections/isis.viewer.restfulobjects.adoc#isis.viewer.restfulobjects.authentication.strategy-class-name[isis.viewer.restfulobjects.authentication.strategy-class-name]


The framework currently provides only basic auth provided as a simple implementation, and this is the default.
