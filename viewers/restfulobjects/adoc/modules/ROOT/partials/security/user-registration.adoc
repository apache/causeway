Unlike the Wicket viewer, the xref:vro:ROOT:about.adoc[Restful Objects viewer] does *not* provide any sort of login page; rather it provides a pluggable authentication strategy, delegated to by the `IsisSessionFilter` filter (set up by the framework's web bootstrapping).
The authentication strategy is responsible for ensuring that a session is available for the REST resource.

The API of `AuthenticationSessionStrategy` is simply:

[source,java]
----
package org.apache.isis.core.webapp.auth;
...
public interface AuthenticationSessionStrategy {
    AuthenticationSession lookupValid(     // <1>
        ServletRequest servletRequest,
        ServletResponse servletResponse);
    void bind(                             // <2>
        ServletRequest servletRequest,
        ServletResponse servletResponse,
        AuthenticationSession authSession);
}

----
<1> returns a valid `AuthenticationSession` for the specified request, response
<2> binds (associates the provided `AuthenticationSession`) to the request and response

Here `AuthenticationSession` is Apache Isis' internal API that represents a signed-on user.

The framework provides a number of simple strategies:

* `AuthenticationStrategyBasicAuth` implements the HTTP basic auth protocol (the pop-up dialog box shown by the web browser)
* `AuthenticationSessionStrategyHeader` that simply reads the user identity from an HTTP header
* `AuthenticationSessionStrategyTrusted` that always logs in with a special "exploration" user

As you can see, none of these should be considered production-quality.

The strategy is configured in `web.xml`; for example:

// TODO: v2: this has changed, I think, because we now use `WebModule_Xxx` instead of `web.xml`, ie set this stuff up programmatically.

[source,xml]
----
<filter>
    <filter-name>IsisSessionFilterForRestfulObjects</filter-name>
    <filter-class>org.apache.isis.core.webapp.IsisSessionFilter</filter-class>
    <init-param>
        <param-name>authenticationSessionStrategy</param-name>
        <param-value>                                           <!--1-->
    org.apache.isis.viewer.restfulobjects.server.authentication.AuthenticationStrategyBasicAuth
        </param-value>
    </init-param>
    <init-param>
        <param-name>whenNoSession</param-name>
        <param-value>auto</param-value>                         <!--2-->
    </init-param>
    <init-param>
        <param-name>passThru</param-name>
        <param-value>/restful/swagger</param-value>             <!--3-->
    </init-param>
</filter>
----
<1> configure basic auth strategy
<2> what to do if no session was found; we use `auto` so as to issue a 401 status code with basic authentication challenge if the request originated from a web browser.  (Prior to `1.11.0` this parameter was set either to `basicAuthChallenge` (which works when requested from web browser) or to `unauthorized` (which works when requested from a suitably coded custom JavaScript app).
<3> which paths are allowed to be accessed directly, without a session.  The `/restful/swagger` path provides access to the SwaggerResource that dynamically generates swagger schema definition files from the Apache Isis metamodel.



The above filter must then be chained before the servlet that actually handles the REST requests:

// TODO: v2: this has changed, I think, because we now use `WebModule_Xxx` instead of `web.xml`, ie set this stuff up programmatically.

[source,xml]
----
<filter-mapping>
    <filter-name>IsisSessionFilterForRestfulObjects</filter-name>
    <servlet-name>RestfulObjectsRestEasyDispatcher</servlet-name>
</filter-mapping>
...
<servlet>
    <servlet-name>RestfulObjectsRestEasyDispatcher</servlet-name>
    <servlet-class>org.jboss.resteasy.plugins.server.servlet.HttpServletDispatcher</servlet-class>
</servlet>

[NOTE]
====
The above `web.xml` fragments do _not_ constitute the full configuration for the Restful Objects viewer, just those parts that pertain to security.
====





Isis currently does not have any out-of-the-box support for user-registration for applications using only the Restful viewer.  However, in principal the pieces do exist to put together a solution.

The general idea is similar to the design of the Wicket viewer; define some subsidiary resources that can operate _without_ a user session in place, and which "reach into" the framework using headless access in order to setup the user.

[TIP]
====
An alternative approach, possibly less work and overall of more value, would be to implement `AuthenticationSessionStrategy` for oAuth, in other words allow users to use their existing Google or Facebook account.
====

The following steps sketch out the solution in a little more detail:

* Define some new Restful resources (cf link:https://github.com/apache/isis/blob/master/core/viewer-restfulobjects-server/src/main/java/org/apache/isis/viewer/restfulobjects/server/resources/DomainObjectResourceServerside.java[DomainServiceResourceServerside] that correspond to sign-up/register page, eg `SignupResource` +
+
[source,java]
----
@Path("/signup")
public class SignupResource {
    ...
}
----

* Create a new subclass of `RestfulObjectsApplication`, eg "CustomRestfulObjectsApplication" and register your resources +
+
[source,java]
----
public class CustomRestfulObjectsApplication extends RestfulObjectsApplication {
    public CustomRestfulObjectsApplication() {
        addClass(SignupResource.class);
    }
}
----

* Register your application class in `web.xml` instead of the default: +
+
// TODO: v2: this may have changed, because we now use `WebModule_Xxx` instead of `web.xml`, ie set this stuff up programmatically.
+
[source,xml]
----
<context-param>
    <param-name>javax.ws.rs.Application</param-name>
    <param-value>com.mycompany.myapp.CustomRestfulObjectsApplication</param-value>
</context-param>
----

So far this is just standard javax.rs stuff.

Next, we need to ensure that a client can hit your new resource *with* the Apache Isis runtime in place, but without there being an Apache Isis session.  For that....

* create a subclass of the `AuthenticationSessionStrategy` that automatically returns a dummy session if the resource being accessed is "/restful/signup", say.  +
+
You could do this by subclassing `AuthenticationStrategyBasicAuth`, but then using code from `AuthenticationStrategyBasicAuth` to return an "exploration" (or better, "signup") session if accessing the "/restful/signup" resource.

* in the `SignUpResource` resource, you can then do a lookup of the `UserRegistrationService` in order to allow the user to be created: +
+
[source,java]
----
final UserRegistrationService userRegistrationService =
    IsisContext.getPersistenceSession().getServicesInjector().lookupService(UserRegistrationService.class);
userRegistrationService.registerUser(userDetails);
----

Obviously the methods exposed by the `SignupResource` are up to you; ultimately they need to be able to gather information to populate the `UserDetails` object as passed to the `UserRegistrationService`.
