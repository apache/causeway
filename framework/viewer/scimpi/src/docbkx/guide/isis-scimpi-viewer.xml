      <section>
        <title>Running the example app</title>

        <para>Eclipse's Web Standard Tools (WST) and J2EE Standard Tools (JST)
        provides tooling for building and running web applications including
        running a Servlet Container from within Eclipse.</para>

        <para>Before running such a web application is necessary to ensure
        that related projects are added to the server's classpath. This is
        done via the properties for the web application project under the
        <emphasis>J2EE Module Dependencies</emphasis> section. In there tick
        the projects that are needed to run Scimpi, at the time of writing
        these are <emphasis>scimpi-dispatcher</emphasis> and
        <emphasis>scimpi-servlet</emphasis>.</para>

        <para>To run the examples with Eclipse right-click on the cart-demo
        project and from the <option>Run As</option> menu select the
        <option>Run on Server</option> option. The dialog that pops up should
        be correctly set for the local server. (If there are no servers set up
        they can be added via the preferences, see the section
        Server/Installed Runtimes and use the Add button to add a server that
        you have installed on your machine.) Press <literal
        moreinfo="none">Next</literal> to move to the second page where you
        add all the other projects as web applications, or <literal
        moreinfo="none">Finish</literal> to run the server.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Generic views</title>

        <para>Access the main page by entering the
        <emphasis>http://localhost:8080/example</emphasis> in the address
        field and pressing the Go button. The opening screen of the browser
        shows the actions of all the services that the application provides,
        i.e., the methods defined in the <link
        linkend="ClaimantRepository_class"><literal>ClaimantRepository</literal></link>
        and <link
        linkend="ClaimRepository_class"><literal>ClaimRepository</literal></link>
        service classes. As for most web applications this is the welcome page
        and in this case maps to <filename
        moreinfo="none">index.shtml</filename>.</para>

        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata fileref="images/example/opening.png" width="12.5cm" />
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>

        <para>Clicking on the links/buttons will invoke the selected method
        and display a generic view. For example the <guibutton
        moreinfo="none">All Claimants</guibutton> button above generates
        invokes the <literal>allClaimants</literal> method on the claimants
        repository service object, which returns a collection. This displays
        the list of claimants as shown below. This uses the template <filename
        moreinfo="none">generic/collection.shtml</filename> to create the
        page.</para>

        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata fileref="images/example/listing.png" width="12.5cm" />
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>

        <para>Clicking on the select link will use another generic page
        (<filename moreinfo="none">generic/object.shtml</filename>) to show
        you detail of the object, while clicking on the edit link will use the
        template <filename moreinfo="none">generic/edit.shtml</filename> to
        provide a page containing an HTML form for editing the object. Here
        you can change the name of the employee.</para>

        <graphic fileref="images/example/generic-edit.png" width="12.5cm" />

        <para>If we now use the same technique to view all the claims and then
        open up a specific one using the select link, the claim viewing page
        (still <filename moreinfo="none">generic/object.shtml</filename>)
        shows the complete claim including a list of the expense items. Notice
        that at bottom of the page there is a second link (below edit), this
        is the action method defined in the <literal>Claim</literal> class
        called <literal>submit</literal>.</para>

        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata fileref="images/example/object-with-method.png"
                       width="12.5cm" />
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>

        <para>Clicking such a link will either invoke the method immediately
        if it has no parameters or, as in this case, it will open up a generic
        action form (<filename
        moreinfo="none">generic/action.shtml</filename>) to allow the user to
        set the parameters before the method is executed. Below we see the
        page that we get after pressing the link on the page above. The
        approver parameter is set to the default value as specified in the
        domain model.</para>

        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata fileref="images/example/generic-action.png"
                       width="12.5cm" />
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>

        <para>After pressing the <guibutton moreinfo="none">OK</guibutton>
        button you are returned to the home page as the method return nothing
        to process. Had the method returned an object then that object would
        displayed. If you navigate back to the claim you will see that the
        approver has been set up and the status changed to
        <emphasis>Submitted</emphasis>.</para>

        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata fileref="images/example/changed-object.png"
                       width="12.5cm" />
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>

        <para>All the above was achieved through generic views, no HTML or
        template pages were written. In the next section we will look at how
        we create our own pages to create a targeted and stylised user
        interface.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Basic Scimpi pages</title>

        <para>If we now create a new page called <filename
        moreinfo="none">example.shtml</filename> (placed in the <filename
        moreinfo="none">example/webapp</filename> directory) with the
        following markup we will be getting Scimpi to run an action and list
        the results to us. This shows us a number of important things about
        Scimpi pages. First, all files with the extension <filename
        moreinfo="none">shtml</filename> are Scimpi files and are processed on
        the server before being sent to the client. These files are
        essentially HTML files with addition Scimpi tags that will replaced
        with dynamic content when processed. Second, all Scimpi tags are of
        the form <markup>&lt;swf:<replaceable>command</replaceable>
        <replaceable>attributes</replaceable>&gt;</markup>.</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="style/screen.css" type="text/css"/&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Claims&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Claims&lt;/h1&gt;
    <emphasis role="strong">&lt;swf:run-action object="service:claims" method="allClaims" /&gt;
    &lt;swf:list type="disc"/&gt;</emphasis>
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</programlisting>

        <para>Depending on how you are running Scimpi you may need to rebuild
        the web application, redeploy it or restart the web server. (Using Ant
        and the provided web server, as described above, you should run Ant
        again (to copy the new file across) and restart the web
        server.)</para>

        <para>This example uses two Scimpi tags to interact with the
        <emphasis>Apache Isis</emphasis> runtime and generate some dynamic
        <acronym>HTML</acronym>. The first tag invokes the action
        <emphasis>allProducts</emphasis> on the service object known as
        <emphasis>claims</emphasis>, which is the claims repository; the
        <emphasis>service:</emphasis> prefix indicates the object is a service
        and <emphasis>claims</emphasis> is the name of the service object as
        provided by its <literal>getId</literal> method. The second tag
        generates an unordered list (OL tag) with a set of list items (within
        LI tags) from the collection that was returned by the previous tag.
        The browser shows the following when the <filename
        moreinfo="none">example.shtml</filename> page is requested.</para>

        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata fileref="images/example/list-tag.png" width="12.5cm" />
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>

        <para>By replacing <literal moreinfo="none">tag &lt;swf:list
        type="disc"/&gt;</literal> with <literal
        moreinfo="none">&lt;swf:table/&gt;</literal> an HTML table will be
        generated instead of a list.</para>

        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata fileref="images/example/table-tag.png" width="12.5cm" />
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>

        <para>As well as tags that practically do all the work of generating
        things likes lists, tables and forms, Scimpi provides tags to allow
        you to build your own. The next example uses the
        <markup>collection</markup> tag in place of <markup>table</markup> to
        control the processing of the contained block. This tag will iterate
        through the collection and for each element will process the contained
        elements so that the elements title and <property
        moreinfo="none">claimant</property> field is displayed along with a
        table showing the <property moreinfo="none">items</property>
        field.</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">    &lt;h1&gt;Claims&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;swf:run-action object="service:claims" method="allClaims" /&gt;
    &lt;swf:collection&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;&lt;swf:title icon="off"/&gt;, for &lt;swf:field field="claimant" icon="off"/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;swf:table field="items"/&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/swf:collection&gt;</programlisting>

        <para>The result of this page are the same three elements as before
        but the layout and detail have been specified in detail.</para>

        </itemizedlist>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Requested resources</title>

        <para>Scimpi processes requests for resources that have the extensions
        <filename moreinfo="none">shtml</filename> and <filename
        moreinfo="none">app</filename> specially. All other resources, such
        images, text files and HTML documents, are assumed to be files and
        return directly as such. Specially handled request are handled by
        Scimpi's dispatcher where the resources with the <filename
        moreinfo="none">app</filename> extension are mapped to Scimpi actions
        and those with the <filename moreinfo="none">shtml</filename>
        extension cause the corresponding file to be read in and processed as
        Scimpi templates containing Scimpi tags that are to be replaced by the
        processor.</para>

        <para>However, when a request is made for a generic page (as
        <uri>_generic.shtml</uri>, <uri>_generic_edit.shtml</uri> and
        <uri>_generic_action.shtml</uri>) Scimpi seeks the most suitable file
        to process the request. The request is based on the object reference
        held by the RESULT variable. Using this object it first looks for a
        directory named after the objects class, and if it exists will look
        for a suitable file. If no such directory exists then a file in the
        <filename moreinfo="none">generic</filename> directory is used. The
        file, from either the <filename moreinfo="none">generic</filename> or
        class named directory, depends on the generic page name. For
        <uri>_generic.shtml</uri> a file called <filename
        moreinfo="none">objects.shtml</filename> or <filename
        moreinfo="none">collection.shtml</filename> is used depending on
        whether the referenced object is an object or a collection. For
        <uri>_generic_edit.shtml</uri> a file called <filename
        moreinfo="none">edit.shtml</filename> is used. When the request is
        <uri>_generic_action.shtml</uri> Scimpi looks for an <filename
        moreinfo="none">shtml</filename> file with the same name as requested
        in the <parameter moreinfo="none">method</parameter> parameter.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Variables</title>

        <para>All web applications are built on HTTP, which is stateless, so
        Scimpi provides a way maintaining state between requests on your
        behalf. By asking Scimpi to store values for you, either implicitly or
        explicitly, your web application can easily refer to objects and other
        data that were used previously. Without such a capability each request
        would effectively be the first request and all needed information
        would have to be encoded within the web page. Every variable in Scimpi
        is known by its given name and is kept for a set duration, known as
        its scope. In addition to the variables that are defined by the web
        application there are others that are automatically provided by the
        system.</para>

        <para>The <markup>variable</markup> tag allows a variable to be
        explicitly set up. This tag simply stores the content of the block
        with the associated name. So the following markup creates a variable
        called <emphasis>duration</emphasis> and stores the value "1250"
        within it (note that it is a string, not a number, as it is taken from
        the HTML page).</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">&lt;swf:variable name="duration"&gt;1250&lt;/swf:variable&gt;</programlisting>

        <para>Once a variable has been declared it can be used within the
        HTML, as markup itself or as attribute, by wrapping the name with
        <emphasis>${</emphasis> and <emphasis>}</emphasis>. So now, for
        example, we can output the value variable in a bold form using the
        following</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">&lt;b&gt;${value}&lt;/b&gt;</programlisting>

        <para>that will result in the following HTML being received by the
        browser.</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">&lt;b&gt;1250&lt;/b&gt;</programlisting>

        <para>Most commonly it is the tags that implicitly set up variables
        with the results of their actions or with references to objects. The
        following example shows an action that places its result, a collection
        of claims, into the <varname>claims</varname> variable, after which
        the <markup>table</markup> tag refers to the collection via the same
        variable (which is written as <emphasis>${claims}</emphasis> to show
        that it is a variable).</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">&lt;swf:run-action object="service:claims" method="allClaims" result-name="claims"/&gt;
&lt;swf:table collection="${claims}"/&gt;</programlisting>

        <para>Note that if you didn't specify a variable for the result to be
        put in then the default variable RESULT would be used instead. The
        same applies to the table tag, which would use the variable RESULT to
        find the claim. This is the same for all other tags the have an
        attribute for a variable name, or that need to refer to an object or
        collection.</para>

        <formalpara>
          <title>Scope</title>

          <para>In the previous examples the two variables that we declared
          would only be available while the current page is being prepared and
          would not exist when the subsequent page is requested. These
          variable therefore have narrowest scope. From the widest to
          narrowest the four available scopes are:-</para>
        </formalpara>

        <variablelist>
          <varlistentry>
            <term>global</term>

            <listitem>
              <para>exists for the lifetime of the server;</para>
            </listitem>
          </varlistentry>

          <varlistentry>
            <term>session</term>

            <listitem>
              <para>exists for the period that the user is logged in;</para>
            </listitem>
          </varlistentry>

          <varlistentry>
            <term>interaction</term>

            <listitem>
              <para>spans two requests: the first request prepares a view; and
              the second is based on data in that first view;</para>
            </listitem>
          </varlistentry>

          <varlistentry>
            <term>request</term>

            <listitem>
              <para>exists only for the current request; will not be available
              during the subsequent request.</para>
            </listitem>
          </varlistentry>
        </variablelist>

        <para>To specific a scope when specifying a variable simply add a
        <parameter moreinfo="none">scope</parameter> attribute with one of the
        four scope names.</para>

      <section>
        <title>References</title>

        <para>The Scimpi viewer provide a mechanism to refer to objects that
        are held by the <emphasis>Isis</emphasis> runtime from within a web
        page, or as part of a URL. An implementation of
        <literal>ObjectMapping</literal> generates a textual string from the
        object's OID. This can then be used as the <parameter
        moreinfo="none">object</parameter> attribute for many of the tags.
        Most commonly these references are stored in, and used from variables,
        this is why for tags that produce results you need to specify a
        variable for the reference to be placed into.</para>

        <para>If an <markup>object</markup> <markup>attribute</markup> starts
        with <emphasis>service:</emphasis> Scimpi will find the service object
        with the identifier as specified after that prefix. The example shows
        how to run a method on the service identified as
        <emphasis>Claims</emphasis>, which is the claims repository</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">&lt;swf:run-action object="service:Claims" method="myRecentClaims" /&gt;</programlisting>

        <formalpara>
          <title>Using the RESULT variable</title>

          <para>When the <markup>object</markup>/<markup>collection</markup>
          attribute is not specified within a tag that must refer to an object
          Scimpi uses the reference held by the RESULT variable instead. This
          special variable is set up when a tag, which produces a results
          (such as the action tags, <markup>collection</markup> or
          <markup>link</markup>), also has no <parameter
          moreinfo="none">variable</parameter> attribute (e.g.
          <markup>result-name</markup> or <markup>element-name</markup>)
          specified. This allows us to use have code like</para>
        </formalpara>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">&lt;swf:run-action object="service:Claims" method="myRecentClaims" /&gt;

&lt;swf:table <emphasis>collection="claims"</emphasis>/&gt;</programlisting>

        <para>This special variable is only available during the request and
        will be replaced by the next tag that produces a result. For example
        the following will fail on the last line as RESULT will contain the
        reference to the last element in the collection as set by the
        <emphasis>collection</emphasis> tag and not the collection as
        originally set by the <emphasis>run-action</emphasis> tag.</para>

        <para>To fix this the <markup>run-action </markup>should specify a

      <section>
        <title>Page references</title>

        <para>As Scimpi has a mechanism for finding the most appropriate page
        for rendering a view of an object (the generic pages, such as
        <filename moreinfo="none">_generic.html</filename>) there are some
        details about page references that you should be aware of.
        Essentially, because the page that was requested might not be the page
        that was served, the relative location of referenced files might not
        be as first expected.</para>

        <para>To make this concrete we will use a simple example. Consider a
        claims page generated in response to a request
        like<emphasis>http://localhost:8080/expenses/Claim/object.shtml?claim=...</emphasis>
        that contains a list of expenses whose hyper-links a<markup>re defined
        as _generic.html</markup> so that the most suitable page will be used.
        When such a link is clicked on the URL used by the browser would,
        therefore, be something like
        <emphasis>http://localhost:8080/expenses/Claim/_generic.shtml?_result=...</emphasis>.
        Now as the page that is returned would be generated from the most
        suitable template it would use the file <filename
        moreinfo="none">object.shtml</filename> from the <filename
        moreinfo="none">ExpenseItem</filename> directory rather than the
        <filename moreinfo="none">Claim</filename> directory. However, the
        generated page when displayed by the browser will still have a base
        URL of <emphasis>http://localhost:8080/expenses/Claim/</emphasis>. An
        image tag on that page, such as <markup>&lt;img
        src="person.png"/&gt;</markup>, will, therefore, result in a request
        from the browser of
        <uri>http://localhost:8080/expenses/Claim/person.png</uri>. This
        obviously will not find the file as it is <filename
        moreinfo="none">ExpenseItem</filename> directory; so a URL intended to
        be relative to the current page ends up being relative to the page in
        the previous request.</para>

        <para>To get round such a problem the URL specified should use the
        system variables <varname>_context</varname> and
        <varname>_directory</varname> to set up the full path. So returning to
        our above example <markup>img</markup> tag should be changed to</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">&lt;img src="${_context}${_directory}person.png"/&gt;</programlisting>

        <para>so that web application context name and the directory that the
        template file is actually in are appended with the image name creating
        a path that absolutely identifies the resource as the resultant HTML
        shows.</para>

        <literallayout>&lt;img src="/expenses/Claim/person.png"/&gt;</literallayout>

        <para>There are four such system variables that relate to URLs:</para>

        <variablelist>
          <varlistentry>
            <term>_base</term>

            <listitem>
              <para>the complete URL for the current resource;</para>
            </listitem>
          </varlistentry>

          <varlistentry>
            <term>_context</term>

            <listitem>
              <para>the web application context name, used to distinguish one
              web application from another and forming the first part of the
              pathname in the URL;</para>
            </listitem>
          </varlistentry>

          <varlistentry>
            <term>_directory</term>

            <listitem>
              <para>the directory containing the current resource;</para>
            </listitem>
          </varlistentry>

          <varlistentry>
            <term>_this</term>

            <listitem>
              <para>the filename of the current resource.</para>
            </listitem>
          </varlistentry>
        </variablelist>

        <para>Such issues can also arise when creating links that are intended
        to show a particular object or run an action. As you not only have to
        get the location correct but also pass over the reference to the
        object to be shown and, for actions, pass over the method name, all by
        creating a long URL it is simpler to use one of the Scimpi link tags
        that takes care of all this for you. So instead of an
        <markup>a</markup> tag like</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">&lt;a href="_generic_edit.shtml?_result=${item}"&gt;edit&lt;/a&gt;</programlisting>

        <para>use the Scimpi <markup>edit-link</markup> tag as follows.</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">&lt;swf:edit-link object="${item}"&gt;edit&lt;/swf:edit-link&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</programlisting>

        <para>Other link tags are <markup>object-link</markup>,
        <markup>action-link</markup> and
        <markup>new-action-link</markup>.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Scimpi tags</title>

        <para>Each tag is used in the form</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">&lt;swf:<emphasis>tag-name</emphasis> <emphasis>attribute-name</emphasis>="<emphasis>attribute value</emphasis>" /&gt;</programlisting>

        <para>for an empty tag, while a tag containing other tags will be of
        the form</para>

        <para><programlisting format="linespecific">&lt;swf:<emphasis>tag-name</emphasis> <emphasis>attribute-name</emphasis>="<emphasis>attribute value</emphasis>"&gt;
    <emphasis>enclosed text or tags</emphasis>
&lt;/swf:<emphasis>tag-name</emphasis>&gt;</programlisting></para>

        <para>Scimpi markup, being XML embedded in XHTML pages, is case
        sensitive. All tag and attribute names must be lower case.</para>

        <section>
          <title>Page layout</title>

          <para>Scimpi pages can import chunks of markup from other files as
          well use a template to form the basis of a page. The
          <markup>import</markup> tag simply reads in a specified file for
          inclusion at the point of the tag. If the file has an <filename
          moreinfo="none">shtml</filename> extension that file is also
          processed. This is useful for including common elements in file such
          as a header or footer.</para>

          <para>The <markup>template</markup> tag similarly reads in a
          specified file, but while it is reading it in it looks for a
          <markup>content</markup> tag and suspends reading when it finds one.
          The remainder of current file is then read in and processed before
          the reading of the template file is completed. So given the two
          files, <filename moreinfo="none">my-template.html</filename> and
          <filename moreinfo="none">my-page.shtml,</filename> as listed
          here</para>

          <programlisting format="linespecific">&lt;hmtl&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Scimpi Page&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;swf:content /&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</programlisting>

          <programlisting format="linespecific">&lt;swf:template  file="my-template.shtml" /&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;My new page&lt;/h1&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>the resultant markup will be as follows,</para>

          <programlisting format="linespecific">&lt;hmtl&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Scimpi Page&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;body&gt;
  <emphasis role="strong">&lt;h1&gt;My new page&lt;/h1&gt;</emphasis>
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>where the content tag has been replaced with content of the
          original file (but without the <markup>template</markup>
          tag).</para>

          <para>Another tool for minimising page size is move common markup
          into separate files and import those block into the multiple files
          when needed using the <markup>import</markup> tag. When using this
          technique it is useful to indicate in the segments file name that it
          is in an import; we place an underscore at beginning of such
          files.</para>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>Form views</title>

          <para>Scimpi has a number of tags that allow objects, and parts of
          objects, to displayed. The whole object can be displayed using the
          <markup>short-form</markup> and <markup>long-form</markup> tags; the
          difference between these two is the short version does not display
          properties that are collections while long version shows these as
          tables.</para>

          <formalpara>
            <title>Linking properties</title>

            <para>Each reference property can be marked so it provides a link
            to a page that shows more details about that object. For each
            property that requires a link add a <markup>link</markup> tag to
            the <markup>short-form</markup>/<markup>long-form</markup> block
            specifying the name of the property in the <parameter
            moreinfo="none">name</parameter> attribute. By default the page
            that you will be linked to is the most appropriate one for that
            type of object; alternatively you can specify a <parameter
            moreinfo="none">view</parameter> attribute so the links is to a
            specific page. The following example ensures that the approver
            field is hyper-linked and the user will be taken the generic
            object view page.</para>
          </formalpara>

          <programlisting format="linespecific">&lt;swf:long-form&gt;
    &lt;swf:link name="approver"/&gt;
&lt;/swf:long-form&gt;</programlisting>

          <formalpara>
            <title>Specifying object properties to include</title>

            <para>By default all properties are shown for these tags, but an
            explicit list of properties can be specified using the
            <markup>include</markup> and <markup>exclude</markup> tags. When a
            <markup>include</markup> tag is added all other properties that do
            not also have an include tag will be excluded. The following
            example shows how the claimant property can be removed by using a
            exclude tag.</para>
          </formalpara>

          <programlisting format="linespecific">&lt;swf:long-form&gt;
    &lt;swf:exclude name="claimant"/&gt;
&lt;/swf:long-form&gt;</programlisting>

          <formalpara>
            <title>Fields and labels</title>

            <para>In addition to displaying the complete or partial object
            using the form tags a property's label and content can also be
            accessed directly allowing an object's view to be constructed
            manually. The <markup>label</markup> tag gets the field's proper
            name while the <markup>field</markup> tag get the field's
            contents. Both take the name of the field in the <parameter
            moreinfo="none">field</parameter> attribute. The following example
            creates a simple colon separated view of the current object,
            showing the claimant, description and status labels and field
            contents.</para>
          </formalpara>

          <programlisting format="linespecific">&lt;div class="form"&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;&lt;swf:label field="claimant"/&gt;: &lt;swf:field field="claimant"/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;&lt;swf:label field="description"/&gt;: &lt;swf:field field="description"/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;&lt;swf:label field="status"/&gt;: &lt;swf:field field="status"/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</programlisting>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>Lists and tables</title>

          <para>List and table views of collections can be most simply created
          using the <markup>list</markup> and <markup>table</markup> tags.
          These tags can be used to create a view from either an explicit
          collection or a collection property within an object. If the
          <parameter moreinfo="none">field</parameter> attribute is specified
          then a collection is deemed to be an object's property otherwise it
          is an explicit collection. When no <parameter
          moreinfo="none">collection</parameter> or <parameter
          moreinfo="none">object</parameter> attribute is specified the RESULT
          variable is used.</para>

          <para>The <markup>list</markup> tag creates a numbered list of the
          form</para>

          <literallayout>&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Submitted - Meeting with client&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Submitted - Meeting in city office&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New - Meeting at clients&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</literallayout>

          <para>but it can also show as bulleted form (as a
          <markup>ul</markup> block) by specifying the <parameter
          moreinfo="none">type</parameter> attribute.</para>

          <para>The <markup>table</markup> tag creates a table with a row for
          each element and a column for each association/value property;
          collection properties are not shown. By default each column has a
          header that shows the name of the property, but this can be

            <title>Linking collection elements</title>

            <para>Within list and tables we can provide links to pages that
            show or manipulate the individual items. By adding a <parameter
            moreinfo="none">link</parameter> attribute Scimpi will create a
            hyper-link (an <markup>a</markup> tag) to the specified page that
            includes a reference to the current element. This Scimpi
            markup</para>
          </formalpara>

          <programlisting format="linespecific">&lt;swf:list type="circle" link="_generic.shtml"/&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>therefore generates the following HTML markup instead of the
          first element in the example above.</para>

          <literallayout>&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="_generic.shtml?_result=Porg.apache.isis.app.cart.Claim@fdzsbkg0"&gt;
Submitted - Meeting with client&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</literallayout>

          <para>The parameter name can be specified using the <parameter
          moreinfo="none">element-name</parameter> attribute and, as can seen
          in the example, this defaults to RESULT.</para>

          <para>As tables can show the element, as a row, and other objects,
          as the columns, it is possible to make the objects link to other
          pages instead of the row. For each column that should be linked a
          <markup>link</markup> tag should be added to the
          <markup>table</markup> block and the <parameter
          moreinfo="none">name</parameter> attribute set to identify the
          property to provide the link on. The following example creates a
          link that lets us view the approver in detail.</para>

          <programlisting format="linespecific">&lt;swf:table&gt;
    &lt;swf:link name="approver" view="_generic.shtml"/&gt;

            <title>Specifying the columns in a table</title>

            <para>The columns displayed in a table can be controlled by adding
            <markup>include</markup> and <markup>exclude</markup> tag to the
            <markup>table</markup> block. By using an <markup>exclude</markup>
            tag you indicate that a named property is not be shown thereby
            reducing the number of columns shown as needed. The
            <markup>include</markup> tag indicates that you want to show a
            named property but not any others thereby allowing the exact
            number of columns specified. The following example excludes the
            approver and claimant columns so all the rest still show.</para>
          </formalpara>

          <programlisting format="linespecific">&lt;swf:table heading="no" &gt;

          <title>Collections</title>

          <para>While the <markup>list</markup> and <markup>table</markup>
          tags provide a quick and simple way of displaying a collection the
          <markup>collection</markup> tag provides the mechanism for building
          up your own view of a collection element by element. The
          <markup>collection</markup> tag takes the same attributes for
          determining the collection as the <markup>list</markup> and
          <markup>table</markup> tags do. The content between the opening and
          closing tags is processed for each element of the collection. By
          default the element's reference is put in the RESULT variable, but
          this can be changed by adding the <parameter
          moreinfo="none">element-name</parameter> attribute. The following
          example shows a <markup>collection</markup> tag used within a
          <markup>ul</markup> tag to create a series of <markup>li</markup>
          elements from the current collection object.</para>

          <title>Element type</title>

          <para>The <markup>element-type</markup> tag can be used to get hold
          of the type of elements a collection holds. If the system is
          configured with internationalization then the name will be
          localized.</para>

          <title>Titles</title>

          <para>An object's title can be displayed using the
          <markup>title</markup> tag. The default version displays an icon
          image as well as the title text, but this can be prevented by
          setting the <parameter moreinfo="none">icon</parameter> attribute to
          <emphasis>no</emphasis>. The following example displays an icon and
          title text as a level three heading.</para>

        <section id="edit_forms">
          <title>Edit forms</title>

          <para>Using the <markup>edit</markup> tag we can display an HTML
          form for an object. Any disabled or uneditable properties are simply
          shown by title while the fields to be edited have the most suitable
          input field created for them.</para>

          <para>Reference fields won't work particularly well in the default
          tag as there is no other available references to set the field to
          unless that field has some options or a default defined for it in
          the model. To make it possible for the user to select a suitable
          reference to set the field with the <markup>selector</markup> tag
          can be used to create a drop-down or options list with suitable
          choices. This tag can either take a collection or an object and a
          method that results in a collection and will create an object
          selection widget. The following example shows how the default
          approver field can be replaced by a list showing all the claimants
          as provided by the claimants repository.</para>

          <programlisting format="linespecific">&lt;swf:edit&gt;
    &lt;swf:selector field="approver" object="service:claimants" method="allClaimants" type="list"/&gt;
&lt;/swf:edit&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>If we want to the give the user some control over what is
          selectable, instead of providing a long and too comprehensive list,
          we can first prompt the user for criteria that can be used when
          calling a method that has one or more parameters. Scimpi then
          creates a form that collected the parameters for that method and
          after the user presses the search button it will create a selection
          list based on the method call using those parameters. In the
          following example the <markup>selector</markup> tag uses the
          <literal>findClaimants</literal> method that takes a
          <literal>String</literal> parameter. This results in a single field
          form that invokes the search method and generates a drop-down list
          (the default type of selector).</para>

          <programlisting format="linespecific">&lt;swf:edit&gt;
    &lt;swf:selector field="approver" object="service:claimants" method="findClaimants"/&gt;
&lt;/swf:edit&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>If more control over the entry field is required then you can
          define your own field within a <markup>form-field</markup> tag. This
          tag simply replaces the auto-generated field with contained block of
          markup leaving you with the responsibility of setting it up
          correctly. This typically means you need to determine the options
          and ensure that the HTML field has a name that matches the property
          in the object. The following simplified example creates a drop-down
          list for the <property moreinfo="none">name</property> property; the
          <parameter moreinfo="none">field</parameter> attribute of the Scimpi
          tag and the <parameter moreinfo="none">name</parameter> attribute of
          the HTML tag must have the same field name.</para>

          <programlisting format="linespecific">&lt;swf:form-field field="name"&gt;
    &lt;select name="name"&gt;
         &lt;option&gt;best&lt;/option&gt;
         &lt;option&gt;average&lt;/option&gt;
         &lt;option&gt;worst&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;/select&gt;
&lt;/swf:form-field&gt;</programlisting>

          <formalpara>
            <title>Controlling the visible fields</title>

            <para>Like the object views, the properties shown in the edit form
            can be controlled using the <markup>include</markup> and
            <markup>exclude</markup> tags. The <markup>exclude</markup> tag
            simply removes the named field from the complete set of fields,
            while a set of <markup>include</markup> tags defines the complete
            list of fields to be shown. It is important to remember that the
            object cannot be saved if all the required properties are not set,
            or if entries are invalid. This can happen when you exclude such
            fields unless they have a default value. The following example
            removes the status and claimant fields from the property
            set.</para>
          </formalpara>

          <programlisting format="linespecific">&lt;swf:edit&gt;
    &lt;swf:exclude name="status"/&gt;
    &lt;swf:exclude name="claimant"/&gt;
&lt;/swf:edit&gt;</programlisting>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>Actions</title>

          <para>Two special tags provide access to all actions for an object
          and for all the actions on all the service objects. These tags -
          <markup>methods</markup> and <markup>services</markup> - are
          typically used for generic pages but can be used on specific pages
          as a way of minimising the amount of tags required to make a number
          of your actions available. The <markup>methods</markup> tag will,
          except on service objects, also provide an edit option that will
          open up an edit view. By default all the actions are displayed,
          either as buttons or links to action pages, but the list can be
          controlled using the <markup>include</markup> and
          <markup>exclude</markup> tags. The following example will provide
          access to all the methods from the claimant service except the
          <literal>allClaimants</literal> one; there will be no edit option
          also as it is for a service.</para>

          <programlisting format="linespecific">&lt;swf:methods object="service:claimants" &gt;
    &lt;swf:exclude name="allClaimants"/&gt;
&lt;/swf:methods&gt;</programlisting>

          <formalpara>
            <title>Common attributes</title>

            <para>All the other action tags target a specific object to run a
            specific action on. These are specified by the <parameter
            moreinfo="none">object</parameter> and <parameter
            moreinfo="none">method</parameter> attributes respectively. Also
            the name of the variable that will hold the results can be
            specified with the <parameter
            moreinfo="none">result-name</parameter> attribute, with its scope
            being set via the <parameter moreinfo="none">scope</parameter>
            attribute. For all the tags that will forward you to another page
            after executing can specify that page when: the result is returned
            (<parameter moreinfo="none">the view</parameter> attribute); when
            no result is returned (void); and when an error (such as a
            validation failure) occurs (<parameter
            moreinfo="none">error</parameter>).</para>
          </formalpara>

          <formalpara>
            <title>In-line actions</title>

            <para>Actions can be run as they are come across while processing
            a page using the <markup>run-action</markup> tag. These are
            typically used when details are needed for other tags in the page.
            The following example shows how a table of all the claims can be
            displayed by running the <literal>allClaims</literal> method on
            the claims repository.</para>
          </formalpara>

          <programlisting format="linespecific">&lt;swf:run-action object="service:claims" method="allClaims"/&gt;
&lt;swf:table/&gt;</programlisting>

          <formalpara>
            <title>Immediate actions</title>

            <para>Some actions can be invoked by the user immediately while
            others require input from the user before they can be run (these
            are covered next). Web users expect links to take them to another
            page while buttons will make a change to the state of the system,
            so Scimpi provides the <markup>action-link</markup> and
            <markup>action-button</markup> tags to allow the appropriate
            rendering. Both tags operate in the same way but while one is
            rendered as a hyper-link the other is a form with no fields, just
            a button. These tags are typically used with methods that do not
            have parameters as the following example shows.</para>
          </formalpara>

          <programlisting format="linespecific">&lt;swf:action-link object="service:claimants" method="allClaimants"/&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>If a method has parameters and they either have a suitable
          default value or you have access to suitable value through the page
          then these tags can also be used for these parameterised methods. If
          the tag specifies a method with parameters it will expect a
          <markup>parameter</markup> tag to specify the parameter's value or
          will use the default value as specified by the model. If neither of
          these exists then an error will be generated. The following example
          creates a form with a button that runs the one parameter submit
          method where the parameter value is that held by the approver
          variable.</para>

          <programlisting format="linespecific">&lt;swf:action-button object="${claim}" method="submit"&gt;
    &lt;swf:parameter number="1" value="${approver}"/&gt;
&lt;/swf:action-button&gt;</programlisting>

          <formalpara>
            <title>Prompted actions</title>

            <para>When an action requires input from the user the
            <markup>action-form</markup> tag should be used to create an HTML
            form with fields for the parameters. Each parameter is displayed
            as an appropriate entry field and, by default, all the parameters
            made visible but this can be controlled using the
            <markup>include</markup> and <markup>exclude</markup> tags. Using
            <markup>include</markup> you can build up a list of all the
            parameters you want to be shown (any parameter then not specified
            through an include is excluded by default), while by using
            <markup>exclude</markup>, specific parameters can be removed from
            the full list. Only parameters that are optional or have a default
            value should, however, be excluded as otherwise the action will
            not be able to be run.</para>
          </formalpara>

          <para>By default the most suitable HTML field is used for each
          particular parameter but it is possible to provide your own fields
          when needed. The simplest option is to use the
          <markup>selector</markup> tag to provide a selection option - as a
          drop-down, list or set of radio buttons - to the user instead of the
          default field. The use of the <markup>selector</markup> tag is
          discussed in the previous section (see <xref
          linkend="edit_forms" />). The alternative is to create your own
          input field using the <markup>form-field</markup> tag, again this is
          described above (see <xref linkend="edit_forms" />). The following
          example shows the <markup>selector</markup> tag in use to provide a
          list of possible approvers.</para>

          <programlisting format="linespecific">&lt;swf:action-form method="submit" view="_generic.shtml" void="../index.shtml"&gt;
    &lt;swf:selector field="param0" object="service:claimants" method="allClaimants"/&gt;

          documentation. As this is a file based store the place it expects to
          find its files must remain both consistence and in existence. The
          problem comes down to the servlet container and the root path it
          gives its web application. Typically the only reliable system
          independent place is the web applications extraction directory but
          this is replaced each time a web application is redeployed. As there
          are no other guaranteed cross-platform directories we can default to
          it is best to specify where the object store should be placed. The
          location of the <acronym>XML</acronym> object store files are
          specified in the <filename

        as that user. This is done via servlet initialisation parameters that
        are set in the <filename moreinfo="none">web.xml</filename>
        configuration file, which the servlet container processes. In the
        <markup>servlet</markup> block two <markup>init-parameter</markup>
        blocks are added to specify the user name and password. The following
        snippet shows the <markup>servlet</markup> block once the two
        parameters have been added.</para>

&lt;/servlet&gt;</programlisting>

        <para>The user name and password specified for auto-login should then
        be added to the password file so that the system user can be
        authenticated. This can be done by adding the following line to the

      <title>Defining Tags</title>

      <para>This chapter looks at setting up a development environment
      (Eclipse) to allow development of the Scimpi framework itself. This is
      the setup for developers of the framework, developers who are writing
      extensions to the framework.</para>

        <title>How Scimpi works</title>

        <para>The Scimpi viewer is used to build Java web applications that
        run in a servlet container such Tomcat or JRun. Using the Apache Isis
        framework to access a Java domain model, the Scimpi viewer can be used
        to create dynamic web pages that access and manipulate that domain
        model.</para>

        <para>Pages are generated by Scimpi by processing template files (with
        the extension <filename moreinfo="none">shtml</filename>) that contain
        special tags that instruct the framework to do particular things (all
        other files with extensions other than <filename
        moreinfo="none">shtml</filename> are passed to the browser unchanged).
        The template files are essentially HTML files interspersed with Scimpi
        tags that are processed and will typically generate some HTML code to
        replace the tag in the file that is passed to browser. Like most other
        web applications the template files, and all other browser requestable
        resources are placed in the <emphasis>webapp</emphasis>
        directory.</para>

          <title>Bootstrapping Apache Isis</title>

          <para>When the servlet container loads the Scimpi based web
          application it starts off by bootstrapping <emphasis>Apache
          Isis</emphasis> and introspecting the domain model. This is
          controlled by the <filename
          moreinfo="none">isis.properties</filename> file. A basic
          configuration, like the one shown below, will list the service
          objects that <emphasis>Isis</emphasis> should make available and the
          fixtures that should be run the first time the web application is
          started to populate the object store with the initial set of domain
          objects.</para>

          before anything can be done, this is the same principle as a
          database engine. The <filename moreinfo="none">passwords</filename>
          file contains a set of user names and passwords for Isis's
          file-based security implementation. The example below defines a set
          of actual users for applications that will be based on Isis] users,
          and a system user (<emphasis>webapp</emphasis>) for applications
          that either have no concepts of users or provide for it within the

          applications that use Isis (system-level) users, for which the to
          parameters for the dispatcher servlet should be removed so that web
          application does not log-in automatically when a session is

        <title>Element Processors</title>

        <para>The Scimpi viewer can be extended by adding new tags and/or
        actions.</para>

        <para>Adding a new tag only requires the implementation of a
        <literal>ElementProcessor</literal> class and its registration within
        the webapp.</para>

        <para>An element processor does two things. It gives a name to the
        element, which is used to write the element in the webpages in the
        form <literal>&lt;swf:<replaceable>name</replaceable>&gt;</literal>.
        Second it processes the tag and generates <acronym>HTML</acronym>
        code. The following is the most basic processor you can create for a
        new tag <literal>&lt;swf:count /&gt;</literal>.</para>

        <programlisting>package org.apache.isis.webapp.view.collection;

import org.apache.isis.webapp.ElementProcessor;
import org.apache.isis.webapp.processor.Request;


public class CountElements implements ElementProcessor {

    public void process(Request request) {
        request.appendHtml("&lt;b&gt;count goes here&lt;/b&gt;");
    }

    public String getName() {
        return "count";
    }

}</programlisting>

        <para>To make this available add the class name needs to be registered
        to the <emphasis>processors</emphasis> list in a suitable
        configuration file. Assuming there is currently no cofiguration file
        then one must be specified in the <filename>WEB-INF/web.xml</filename>
        file first. Add an <emphasis>init parameter</emphasis> to the
        dispatcher servlet element as below:</para>

        <literallayout>    :
    :
    &lt;servlet&gt;
        &lt;servlet-name&gt;dispatcher&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
        &lt;servlet-class&gt;org.apache.isis.webapp.servlet.DispatcherServlet&lt;/servlet-class&gt;
        &lt;init-param&gt;
            &lt;param-name&gt;config&lt;/param-name&gt;
            &lt;param-value&gt;config.xml&lt;/param-value&gt;
        &lt;/init-param&gt;
        :
        :</literallayout>

        <para>The name must be <emphasis>config</emphasis>, but the file name
        can be changed to suit.</para>

        <para>Next, create that file in the WEB-INF directory and specify the
        full class name of the processor. Here is the
        <filename>WEB-INF/config.xml</filename> file for this example.</para>

        <literallayout>&lt;config&gt;
    &lt;processors&gt;
