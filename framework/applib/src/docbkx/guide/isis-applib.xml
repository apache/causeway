    <para><emphasis>Apache Isis</emphasis> is designed to allow programmers
    rapidly develop domain-driven applications following the <ulink
    url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_Objects">Naked Objects</ulink>
    pattern. It is made up of a core framework plus a number of alternate
    implementations, and supports various viewers and runtimes/object stores.
    Apache Isis is hosted at the <ulink

    <para>This guide is written for programmers looking to understand the
    programming conventions, annotations and supporting utilities within the
    <emphasis>Apache Isis</emphasis> application library (or
    <emphasis>applib</emphasis>), in order that the framework can correctly
    pick up and render the business rules and logic encoded within their

      <title>What's in this Guide</title>

      <para>This guide describes the set of conventions for writing domain
      objects, that are together known as the <emphasis>Apache Isis</emphasis>
      Programming Model. It's important reading for developers who are looking
      to write domain-driven applications either for prototyping or deployment
      on <emphasis>Apache Isis</emphasis>.</para>

      <para>More correctly, this guide actually documents the
      <emphasis>default</emphasis> programming model, targetted for the Java
      programming language, and implemented by the
      <classname>org.apache.isis.progmodels:dflt</classname> module.
      <emphasis>Isis</emphasis> is in fact capable of supporting different
      programming models, either for other JVM-based languages; for example
      the Groovy language is supported in the
      <classname>org.apache.isis.progmodels:groovy</classname> module. Those
      other programming models have their own documentation.</para>

      <title>This Guide vs the Core Documentation</title>

      <para>This guide assumes that you have at least the outline of a running
      <emphasis>Apache Isis</emphasis> application, for example having run the
      quickstart archetype. Details of how to run the quickstart archetype can
      be found on the <emphasis>Isis</emphasis> <ulink
      url="http://incubator.apache.org/isis">website</ulink>.</para>

      <para>This guide has two main objectives:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>to describe the general approach for developing Isis
          applications solely by writing domain objects</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>to describe the specifics of writing domain objects according
          to the conventions of the <emphasis>default</emphasis> programming
          model.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>The core documentation, on the other hand, explains the wider
      landscape of what makes up an <emphasis>Isis</emphasis> application,
      dealing with such matters as running the app with different components,
      eg viewers, security, programming models, profile stores and
      runtimes/object stores. Included within this is an explanation of how
      you can build your <emphasis>own</emphasis> programming model (typically
      as a subset of the default programming model described here, but
      possibly with additional custom elements).</para>

      <title>Where Next?</title>

      <para>This guide is in several parts. The first part is intended to
      explain, from a developers' perspective, what exactly <emphasis>Apache
      Isis</emphasis> is. The second part has chapters that describe the
      specifics in the style of recipes/cookbooks, providing a "how-to" guide
      on developing domain objects. The third part provides details on other
      supporting features relevant to writing domain applications. The final
      part is a series of appendices that provide details of the programming
      model in reference form. You should find this more useful if you've used
      <emphasis>Isis</emphasis> for a while and just need to check on a
      specific detail.</para>

        <para>Understanding Apache Isis and the naked objects pattern by way
        of a series of questions and answers.</para>
      </abstract>

      <para>The headline feature that distinguishes <emphasis>Apache
      Isis</emphasis> from other frameworks is its support for the naked
      objects pattern - the ability to generate a user interface (at runtime)
      directly from the domain model. However, there's much more to
      <emphasis>Apache Isis</emphasis> than this.</para>

      <para>This chapter introduces the <emphasis>Apache Isis</emphasis> and
      the naked objects pattern by way of a series of questions and answers.
      It is adapted from an <ulink
      url="http://www.infoq.com/articles/haywood-ddd-no">interview originally
      published on InfoQ</ulink>.</para>

      <sect1>
        <title>Apache Isis implements the naked objects pattern... but what is
        that, exactly?</title>

        <para>Naked objects is an architectural pattern where the idea is to
        automatically expose a domain model objects directly within a
        object-oriented user interface... not just their state (properties and
        collections) but also their behaviour (what we call actions). You can
        think of it as analogous to an <acronym>ORM</acronym> such as <ulink
        url="http://hibernate.org">Hibernate</ulink>; but whereas an
        <acronym>ORM</acronym> reflects the domain model into the persistence
        layer, naked objects reflects the domain model into the presentation
        layer.</para>

        <para>Naked Objects (capitals) was a Java framework that implemented
        the naked objects (lower case) pattern. Since then, we've taken the
        original framework, along with a number of sister projects developed
        by the community, into the Apache Incubator. So, what was originally
        "Naked Objects" is now Apache Isis.</para>
      </sect1>

      <sect1>
        <title>What type of applications are best suited to Isis?</title>

        <para>The naked objects pattern requires that your primary
        consideration is in building an object-oriented domain model, so it's
        most suitable for enterprise applications that have complex business
        rules where there's a desire to represented them within such a domain
        model. The idea - at least during the initial stages - is to build up
        a domain model quickly, and to get feedback from the domain experts by
        exploiting the framework's ability to expose that directly domain
        model within the user interface. A picture tells a thousand
        words.</para>

        <para>Apache Isis "sweet spot" are those applications that are used
        internally within the organization, by experienced users who are
        comfortable with the entities within the domain model, and just need
        an application that imposes as few constraints as possible on how it
        is used. These are sometimes called <emphasis>sovereign
        applications</emphasis>. If you're a developer then your
        <acronym>IDE</acronym> is probably the sovereign application you use
        the most, and how often did you use any of its wizards? And if you use
        telephone banking then you'll also know how frustrating a sovereign
        application can be that is too invasive in dictating the workflow...
        that poor person on the other end asks making apologies while she goes
        exits from one screen and then goes into another to check some detail
        on a bank account. The generic <acronym>OO</acronym>
        <acronym>UI</acronym>s generated by naked objects impose no such
        restrictions, and so are ideal for this sort of application.</para>
      </sect1>

      <sect1>
        <title>And are there applications where the OO UIs generated by Isis
        are less suitable?</title>

        <para>The opposite of a sovereign application (above) is sometimes
        called a <emphasis>transient application</emphasis>. These are ones
        used only occasionally or by inexperienced users, typically outside
        the organization (ie your customers), who don't know or care to know
        the domain model, and just want to be led through the system to
        accomplish some well-defined goal. A good example here is a check-in
        kiosk at an airport... you just want to get on the plane, and be given
        the opportunity to choose your seat. But you likely won't care which
        plane, or even plane type, nor who the pilot is; these are unimportant
        details.</para>

        <para>For this sort of application a generic <acronym>OO</acronym>
        <acronym>UI</acronym> that exposes lots of the domain is clearly not
        appropriate. Instead, we want an application that exposes view models
        rather than entities, and where the <acronym>UI</acronym> can be
        customized. The view model object is responsible for managing the
        workflow for the user story, exposing just the subset of the domain
        that is relevant, and hiding the rest of the domain. We find that
        these view models can be layered on top of the entities once those
        entities are understood.</para>

        <para>Using view model objects is necessary but probably not
        sufficient for transient applications; we also usually need to
        customize the <acronym>UI</acronym>. <emphasis>Apache Isis</emphasis>
        has two viewers that allow the UI to be customized, one that provides
        a set of taglibs, and one that provides a set of <ulink
        url="http://wicket.apache.org">Apache Wicket</ulink>
        components.</para>

        <para>Putting both of these techniques together (custom view models
        and views) means that Apache Isis is suitable for transient
        applications as well as sovereign applications. However, the former
        will necessarily take more work as opposed to the latter.</para>
      </sect1>

      <sect1>
        <title>What is the typical development process life cycle for
        applications built with Isis, and how does it compare to traditional
        application development process?</title>

        <para>The main difference you're likely to encounter is the emphasis
        on developing the domain model at the same time as identifying and
        prioritizing user stories, what those practicing domain driven design
        call a "ubiquitous language" for the team.</para>

        <para>So, rather than let the developers in the team "discover" the
        domain model as part of story implementation, we'd expect that the
        domain experts/business analysts have already identified some of the
        main domain concepts through prototyping or spikes, and these can be
        used to help communicate the stories to the developers during the
        planning game. Not every business analyst is going to feel comfortable
        working with an <acronym>IDE</acronym>, but it works well to pair with
        a developer. Because an Apache Isis application can be runs just from
        domain classes, it's possible to develop the app very very quickly.
        We've found a good technique is to run workshops with the business
        analyst facilitating the meeting with the domain experts, and the
        developer acting as "code monkey" to rapidly convert the ideas into an
        app. Obviously the code isn't production quality, but it allows the
        team as a whole to go very quickly and experiment with different
        representations of the model.</para>

        <para>Another alternative is to go a little more slowly, and have the
        analyst and developer pairing to write production code. The analyst
        still focuses on identifying and naming the domain concepts and their
        relationships, while the developer's role (as well as learning about
        the domain) is to ensure that there's enough rigour and tests around
        the code that's been written while this is being done. Of course, both
        approaches to pairing can be used, sometimes spiking ideas, sometimes
        going straight to writing tested code.</para>

        <para>Of course, while the naked objects pattern means that no
        <acronym>UI</acronym> code needs to be written in order to elicit
        feedback, there do still need to be objects in the app for the domain
        expert to view. Apache Isis has a pluggable runtime/persistence layer,
        and for prototyping and most of development we recommend using the
        in-memory object store. To populate this object store for each run we
        use fixtures, which we usually arrange into a composite pattern to
        setup data needed for the particular scenario we might be working on.
        Using Isis in this way means that we spend our time alternating
        between defining domain classes and writing fixture data. This can be
        a great benefit because it helps the domain experts - who after all
        aren't necessarily technical - distinguish between what are classes
        and what are instances of classes. For example, if I'm writing a
        library system and we identify there are loanable books and reference
        books, we need to know whether "loanable book" and "reference book"
        are different subclasses of a book superclass, or merely different
        instances of a book class with, say, a loanable property set to true
        or false. Seeing a running application makes it much easier for the
        domain expert to make the call.</para>

        <para>In terms of writing tests, there are several options. First,
        because the domain objects you write are basically pojos that follow
        some naming conventions, they are very easy to test using standard
        <acronym>TDD</acronym> tools such as <ulink
        url="http://junit.org">JUnit</ulink> and <ulink
        url="http://jmock.org">JMock</ulink>. And if you wanted to, you could
        test the <acronym>UI</acronym> generated by Isis using <ulink
        url="http://seleniumhq.org/">Selenium</ulink> and similar; indeed we'd
        recommend that if you've customized the <acronym>UI</acronym>.</para>

        <para>In addition, though, Isis provides a couple of additional
        BDD/testing framework integrations. One of these is an integration
        with <ulink url="http://fitnesse.org">FitNesse</ulink>, and a newer
        one we've worked on is an integration with <ulink
        url="http://concordion.org">Concordion</ulink>. In both cases the
        integrations provide the glue code so you can exercise your domain
        objects directly. For example, your spec might say "the place order
        action cannot be invoked if the product is out of stock". All the
        developer needs to do is to wire the spec to these pre-canned
        integrations, specifying that the
        <methodname>placeOrder()</methodname> action should be called on a
        <classname>Product</classname>.</para>

        <para>Isis also provides a JUnit runner that works by bootstrapping
        the Isis runtime for each test, and proxying the domain objects with a
        bit of cglib so that they are interacted with "as if" through the
        <acronym>UI</acronym>. For example, let's go back to that
        <methodname>placeOrder()</methodname> action. To prevent this from
        being called for a <classname>Product</classname> that's out of stock,
        the developer would write a corresponding
        <methodname>validatePlaceOrder()</methodname> method. Isis
        automatically calls this validate method prior to the
        <methodname>placeOrder()</methodname> method, and uses the return
        value ("that product is out of stock") as the reason why the action
        can't be invoked. In the <acronym>UI</acronym>, this business rule is
        represented by greying out the OK button of the action. In the JUnit
        runner, this rule is represented by having the cglib proxy throw a
        validation exception if the test calls
        <methodname>placeOrder()</methodname> with an out of stock
        <classname>Product</classname>.</para>

        <para>In terms of deployment, there's several steps involved, probably
        the most significant being to select the runtime and object store. As
        noted above, Isis has a pluggable persistence layer; you can use the
        in-memory object store for developing, but will want to switch to a
        "real" object store for deployment. The amount of work required here
        depends on the object store selected; in the case of
        <acronym>JPA</acronym>/Hibernate support, for example, it amounts to
        annotating your domain entities with annotations, and writing
        implementations of some of the repositories to make the relevant
        <acronym>SQL</acronym> calls.</para>
      </sect1>

      <sect1>
        <title>What are the limitations of Apache Isis framework?</title>

        <para>It's certainly true that naked objects pattern implemented by
        <emphasis>Apache Isis</emphasis> is opinionated, so if you don't agree
        with all of its opinions then you're going to find it limiting in one
        way or another.</para>

        <para>The first of these is that everything that the user wants to
        interact with has to be an object of some sort. As already explained,
        for sovereign applications, these are likely to be the persisted
        domain entities, but for a transient application, the object may be a
        view model to be support a particular workflow, and which may or may
        not be persisted. Such an approach probably wouldn't be considered
        much of a limitation, but it's worth contrasting with architectures
        (eg Spring Web Flow or Struts) where put the responsibility for
        tracking workflow lives not in an object but instead within some sort
        of declarative XML markup (or even just in the interplay between
        controllers and views).</para>

        <para>A slightly more subtle consequence of the above is that
        integration of different technologies happens through the domain
        objects, rather than in front of them through application-layer or
        <acronym>UI</acronym> layer mashups. For example, supposing that we
        wanted to have an <acronym>SMS</acronym> sent out to confirm a
        checkout. If you were writing the <acronym>UI</acronym> and
        application service layer yourself, you might choose to have the
        application layer make the call to the <acronym>SMS</acronym> service,
        judging it to be a coordination responsibility. With
        <emphasis>Isis</emphasis>, though, you don't get the chance to write
        any application layer code, and so this would be done by having the
        domain object call out to the <acronym>SMS</acronym> service. The
        <acronym>SMS</acronym> service would be defined by an interface, and
        the implementation would be injected into the domain object by the
        framework. For some reason not everyone is necessarily comfortable
        about injecting domain services into entities; but it works well for
        us and we're sticking with it.</para>

        <para>Another area where <emphasis>Isis</emphasis> is going to feel
        different - and perhaps limiting to some - is that it pushes some
        responsibilities onto the domain objects that otherwise might sit in
        other layers. For example, above we discussed that a
        <methodname>placeOrder()</methodname> action on a
        <classname>Customer</classname> can have a supporting
        <methodname>validatePlaceOrder()</methodname> method. It's also
        possible to have <methodname>disablePlaceOrder()</methodname> method,
        which if returning non-null will cause the action to be greyed out the
        action in the <acronym>UI</acronym>. For example, a blacklisted
        <classname>Customer</classname> might not allow any orders to be
        placed, and would indicate this through the disable method. Some might
        consider this as a misplaced presentation concern. However, the
        <classname>Customer</classname> isn't greying out the
        <acronym>UI</acronym> itself; the disable method is merely a
        convention by which the presentation layer can interrogate the
        entity.</para>

        <para>Something else we hear sometimes about naked objects-style
        systems is that they are really only suitable for
        <acronym>CRUD</acronym> style applications. It has to be said that
        it's a criticism that does irk; because although its true that naked
        objects frameworks automatically expose object state, they also expose
        object's behaviour. That is, every public method that is not a
        property or a collection is taken to be an action and will rendered by
        the <acronym>UI</acronym> as a button or a link. Indeed, we sometimes
        like to talk of behaviourally complete domain objects; it's the very
        antithesis of the anaemic domain model anti-pattern.</para>

        <para>All the above notwithstanding, probably the biggest impediment
        to going out and using Isis right now is that it's a small community
        and as such the codebase is still relatively new. But if that is a
        turn-off, note that you can still use Apache Isis to prototype your
        domain model, because they are just pojos after all. Indeed, embedding
        Isis' metamodel for a deployment hosted on some other framework is the
        objective of the <emphasis>embedded runtime</emphasis> component of
        Isis</para>
      </sect1>

      <sect1>
        <title>How extensive is the application security support provided by
        Isis?</title>

        <para><emphasis>Apache Isis</emphasis> exposes a pluggable
        authentication <acronym>API</acronym> and an authorization
        <acronym>API</acronym>, with default implementations of both.</para>

        <para>The job of the authentication <acronym>API</acronym> is to
        authenticate the user credentials and return the user Id and a set of
        roles for that user. This information is then used in one of two ways.
        The authorization <acronym>API</acronym> uses it to implement
        declarative class-based security, that is, associating access to
        features based on the roles of the user. In addition, though, a domain
        object instance can also access the user credentials, and so can
        implement imperative instance-based checks if required.</para>

        <para>For example, we might say that only a user with
        <acronym>HR</acronym> role can award pay rises to an
        <classname>Employee</classname>. This is a class-based check and would
        be implemented through the authorization <acronym>API</acronym>. But,
        we might also say that a user is allowed to view (though not modify)
        their own salary of their <classname>Employee</classname> object, but
        no-one else's. This would be an instance-based check, and would be
        implemented in the object itself.</para>

        <para>In terms of how naked objects restricts access, this is done
        either by making an object member (property, collection or action)
        invisible, or, if it is visible, then making it unusable (greyed
        out).</para>

        <title>How does an Isis applications manage the custom logic in terms
        of business rules, workflow and other business logic that developers
        have to manually implement outside the generated code?</title>

        <para>"Business rules" is one of those amorphous terms that means
        different things to different people. A consequence is that the team
        can struggle to nail down exactly where such rules should reside, so
        that these rules can start to leach out of the domain layer and the
        application layer, or even worse, the presentation layer. As noted
        already, one of the principles of naked objects is that domain objects
        are behaviourally complete. What that means is that business rules and
        "other business logic" are the responsibility of domain objects. For
        workflow, again as noted earlier, we suggest that you introduce a view
        model object and have that manage the user's interaction.</para>

        <para>However, saying that business rules are an object's
        responsibility doesn't necessarily mean that the implementation has to
        be in Java. We already said that domain objects can delegate work out
        to domain services that are injected into them. So if you want to put
        your business rules into a rules engine, that's fine. Wrap the
        interface to the rules engine within a domain service, and have the
        domain object call out to the domain service in order to fulfil its
        responsibility.</para>

        <para>In practical terms, you're going to see business rules both in
        the small-scale and the large. Small-scale business rules tend to be
        implemented in terms of the supporting methods (disable, validate and
        so on) that encode the preconditions for interactions. These ensure
        that the object or the providing arguments is are valid and will veto
        the interaction otherwise (blacklisted customers, out-of-stock
        products). The larger-scale business rules are represented as actions
        on an object that can perform arbitrary business logic, such as
        modifying its own state, or related objects, and/or delegating out to
        domain services.</para>

        <title>How does Isis support SOA-based applications, eg where an
        enterprise service component is consumed by several different
        applications and other clients?</title>

        <para>We can actually answer this both in terms of an Isis application
        consuming <acronym>SOA</acronym><footnote>
            <para>SOA=Service Oriented Architecture</para>
          </footnote> services, and in it <emphasis>providing</emphasis>
        services.</para>

        <para>For consuming <acronym>SOA</acronym> services, the answer is
        easy enough: wrap the <acronym>SOA</acronym> service in a domain
        service interface, and then register the implementation with the
        framework so that the service is injected into each domain object.
        That interaction can be either synchronous or asynchronous; there's
        nothing to prevent the domain object publishing an event to be picked
        up by some other component out there on your enterprise service
        bus.</para>

        <para>As to providing <acronym>SOA</acronym> services, Isis'
        <acronym>JSON</acronym> viewer exposes the domain objects as a set of
        RESTful resources. We map objects and object members to the standard
        <acronym>HTTP</acronym> verbs, eg so that a GET on an object returns
        an object representation, a PUT on an object's property will modify
        the state, or a POST on an object's actions will invoke the action. As
        its name suggests, the <acronym>JSON</acronym> viewer produces a
        <acronym>JSON</acronym> representation, making it easy to consume (eg
        in HTML5 or RIA applications).</para>
      </sect1>

      <sect1>
        <title>Most enterprise applications need to reuse the domain and
        service layer classes between several different applications. How does
        Apache Isis address this?</title>

        <para>One way to think of reuse in terms of strategic domain-driven
        design, which couches the discussion in terms of identifying bounded
        contexts and understanding the relationship between these contexts -
        context maps.</para>

        <para>You can think of a bounded context as both the user population
        that understands a particular ubiquitous language as well as the
        actual system that they use. For example, the term "Customer" is going
        to mean one thing to the marketing department, but a potentially
        different thing to those in shipping. Those two user populations
        therefore have incompatible languages, and so any integration of
        systems that support both sets of users will need to explicitly map
        their meanings of those terms.</para>

        <para>Simplifying somewhat, an Isis (naked objects) application can be
        thought of in three parts: the domain model objects themselves, the
        viewer that provides a channel to interact with the domain model, and
        the domain services that are used by the domain model objects. The
        domain model objects encode a ubiquitous language for a particular
        bounded context, so it only makes sense to reuse them by users who
        have the same understanding of that language. We can if we want use
        view model objects to provide projections of the domain entities to
        different subsets of that user population, but all must agree with
        what a Customer is, even if they use different parts of said
        Customer.</para>

        <para>Viewers are channels by which the domain model is accessed.
        <emphasis>Apache Isis</emphasis> has viewers that expose the domain
        model as either a desktop app or as a webapp, and also has a RESTful
        viewer (producing <acronym>JSON</acronym>) which allow the view model
        objects/domain objects to be surfaced as RESTful resources. In
        <acronym>DDD</acronym> terms the RESTful viewers are examples of an
        "open host service" context mapping from some client bounded context
        up to our model's context.</para>

        <para>With respect to domain services, these are not reusable per se,
        rather they allow the domain objects to be the client of some other
        service within the enterprise. That said, one common type of domain
        service is to provide an interface to an enterprise service bus, in
        which case the domain objects can publish events onto that bus. In
        <acronym>DDD</acronym> terms this would be an example of a "published
        language" context mapping; the downstream systems consuming the events
        of the publishing domain objects.</para>

        <para>Naked objects also allows a somewhat finer-grained level of
        reuse; indeed its support for "don't repeat yourself" is one of the
        reasons that some people are attracted to the pattern. For example, if
        we declare a property or an action parameter to be a date, then the
        viewers will automatically provide a date chooser widget for that
        property or parameter unless indicated otherwise. Or, if a property's
        type is an enum, then we'll get a drop-down box. It's the conventions
        of the naked objects programming model - establishing a protocol of
        interaction between the presentation layer and the domain model - that
        enable this sort of reuse.</para>

        <para>Some of Isis' more recent viewers also allow mashups within the
        <acronym>UI</acronym>. For example, the viewer that we've implemented
        using Apache Wicket uses the chain of responsibility pattern to build
        the <acronym>UI</acronym>. If we have an entity can provide its
        <classname>Location</classname> (eg, it implements
        <classname>Locatable</classname>), then a GoogleMapsWidget will render
        the entity in a map. Or, if an entity has a date, then a
        CalendarWidget might render the entity on a calendar. This stuff is
        extensible so you're free to write your own components and reuse (or
        indeed invent your own) domain semantics as you see fit.</para>

        <title>What is the future road map of the project?</title>

        <para>Our proposal to join the incubator is online, and that captured
        the thoughts we had at that point in time <ulink
        url="http://wiki.apache.org/incubator/IsisProposal">[1]</ulink>. A
        general theme is in the ongoing development of the various viewers,
        such as the Wicket viewer, improving JSON support within the RESTful
        viewers, and ongoing development of the taglib-based viewer, Scimpi.
        Contributors who have expressed interest in developing similar viewers
        using JSF/Facelets, Tapestry, on Android and in JavaFX/Visage.</para>

        <para>Isis has a pluggable architecture with about five major APIs
        (and numerous more fine-grained APIs) that can be developed. Probably
        the most significant of these is the runtime/persistence
        <acronym>API</acronym>. One piece of work is to develop an ORM-based
        object store from Hibernate (which is not compatible with Apache's) to
        a compatible JPA implementation, We've also had a suggestion [<ulink
        url="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ISIS-14">2</ulink>] to
        re-implement using JDO 3.0/DataNucleus, which would allow us to cover
        a lot of persistence technologies in one fell swoop</para>

        <para>Another objective during incubation is to make Isis more easily
        bootstrappable and embeddable, and for that JSR-299 (Contexts and
        Dependency Injection) looks promising. For example, it should be easy
        to take just the <emphasis>Isis</emphasis> metamodel component and use
        it within your own applications, eg to drive the rendering of domain
        objects within custom <acronym>UI</acronym> code.</para>

        <para>One other area we might see work is in support for other JVM
        languages. Isis already supports Groovy as well as Java, and the way
        that Isis builds up its metamodel means that supporting other
        languages (Scala, Fantom, Go) ought to be pretty
        straightforward.</para>

        <para>Ultimately, though, Apache Isis' roadmap depends on where its
        community wants to take it; so any of the above might change as we
        progress through to graduation.</para>

        <para>We tend to organize <emphasis>Isis</emphasis> applications to

        <emphasis>quickstart</emphasis> Maven archetype (see the
        <emphasis>Isis</emphasis> <ulink
        url="http://incubator.apache.org/isis">website</ulink>) to set this up
        for you. This sets up a simple application that can be run
        out-of-the-box using the default runtime and in-memory object store,
        and supporting a number of the webapp viewers. The WAR file can be run
        either standalone from the command line or deployed to a servlet
        container such as Tomcat.</para>

      <sect1>
        <title>Programming Model</title>

        <para>Once you've got the archetype application running, you're ready
        to start developing your own domain objects. But no matter what
        application you are developing, you'll need to understand the
        <emphasis>Isis programming model</emphasis>.</para>

        <para>The programming model is the set of annotations and programming
        conventions that Isis recognizes. You'll find full details of the
        programming model in this guide; see <xref
        linkend="prt.WritingDomainObjects" />.</para>

        <para>In addition, the applib contains a small number of utilities
        which can be useful when writing your application: one such is the
        ability to create XML snapshots of your domain object graphs, see
        <xref linkend="chp.XmlSnapshots" />.</para>
      </sect1>

      <sect1>
        <title>Fixtures and Prototyping</title>

        <para>We suggest that the fastest way to develop your application is
        to start prototyping using the in-memory object store (set up
        automatically by the quickstart archetype). The nice thing about
        working this way is that there is no database schema to slow you down;
        you can make changes and then rapidly try them out.</para>

        <para>On the other hand, the in-memory object store doesn't persist
        objects between runs, so you'll soon tire of continually recreating
        test objects to try out your changes. You should therefore use
        fixtures: blocks of code that are used to setup objects in the
        in-memory object store prior to the app running.</para>

        <para>You can find more information about using fixtures in <xref
        linkend="chp.Fixtures" />. It's also worth knowing about fixtures
        because they are used when writing tests for your domain application
        (see <xref linkend="sec.AgileTesting" />).</para>

          <para>When writing unit tests, you have a choice. Since all the

        <para>The idea behind the <filename>domain</filename> module is to
        provide some off-the-shelf code for you to use and adapt in your own
        applications. This code is fully tested (comes with tests), and is
        intended to be well-designed. Using code from the library should give
        you a kick-start in writing your own domain applications.</para>

        <note>
          <para>The library is currently very modest, but we hope it might
          build up in time.</para>
        </note>

        <para>Of course, there's a limit to the complexity of the code that's
        included in the library, because every domain is different. But having
        a full set of tests should allow you to safely refactor the code to
        your own requirements.</para>

        <para>There's also no guarantee that the library will contain code for
        your specific requirement. But if you do write some domain logic that
        you think might be reusable by others, why not consider donating it
        back to Isis when you've done so?</para>

        <para>The domain library breaks out into three: services, entities and

        <sect2>
          <title>Domain Services</title>

          <para><emphasis>Apache Isis</emphasis> applications use
          <emphasis>domain service</emphasis>s (a domain-driven design
          pattern) to allow objects to interact with other domains (or
          <emphasis>bounded context</emphasis>s, to use the correct term).
          These domain services are automatically injected into each domain
          object as it is instantiated.</para>

          <para>Domain services split into two: those that interact with
          technical domains (such as sending email, or rendering
          <acronym>PDF</acronym>s), and those that interact with business
          domains (such as general ledger, <acronym>CRM</acronym>s or legacy
          systems).</para>

          <para>Obviously domain services that bridge to business domain
          services are always likely to be specific to each individual
          application. So the services in the
          <filename>domain/services</filename> module focus on providing
          off-the-shelf implementations for some of the more common
          <emphasis>technical</emphasis> domain services.</para>

          <classname>java.lang.String</classname>,
          <classname>java.math.BigDecimal</classname> and

          (java.sql.Date, java.sql.Time and

          pluggability on the back-end, i.e. persistence.</para>

          <para>In fact, there are two decisions to be made here: which
          runtime to use, and (if using the default runtime), which object
          store to use. The default runtime is the one originally developed
          within the <emphasis>Naked Objects Framework</emphasis>, and
          therefore has been inherited by <emphasis>Apache

          <para>If using the default runtime, you have the option of choosing
          the objectstore. As already discussed, the quickstart archetype
          configures the in-memory objectstore by default, which is great for
          rapid prototyping. However, at some point you will need to integrate
          with a "real" object store that persists object to some sort of
          serialized persistence.</para>

          <para>Of the object stores to provided by the default runtime, some
          are easy to configure, some more complex; some are only suitable for

              incompatible licenses. Support for an ORM will in the future be
              provided either by porting the JPA object store to the default

    <title>Writing Domain Objects</title>

    <partintro>
      <para>The conventions of the programming model are best described as
      'intentional' - they convey an intention as to how domain objects, their
      properties and behaviours, are to be made available to users. The
      specific way in which those intentions are interpreted or implemented
      will depend upon the framework, and/or the particular components or
      options selected within that framework.</para>

      <para>To pick a single example, marking up a domain class with the
      annotation <code>@Bounded</code> is an indication that the class is
      intended to have only a small number of instances and that the set does
      not change very often - such as the class <code>Country</code>. This is
      an indication to a viewer, for example, that the whole set of instances
      might be offered to the user in a convenient form such as a drop-down
      list. The programming convention has <emphasis>not</emphasis> been
      defined as <code>@DropDownList</code> because any equivalent mechanism
      will suffice: a viewer might not support drop-down-lists but instead
      might provide a capability to select from an <code>@Bounded</code> class
      by typing the initial letters of the desired instance.</para>

      for writing domain objects, by which we mean domain entities, value

        <para>It isn't mandatory for domain entities to inherit from any

        required. However, they do at a minimum need to have a
        <classname>org.apache.isis.applib.DomainObjectContainer</classname>
        injected into them (an interface), from which other framework services
        can be accessed.</para>

        <title condition="java">How to specify a title for an object</title>

        <para>A title is used to identify an object to the user in the user
        interface. For example, a <classname>Customer</classname>'s title
        might be the organization's customer reference, or perhaps (more
        informally) their first and last names.</para>

        <para>By default, the framework will use the object's <literal
        moreinfo="none">toString()</literal> method as the title. Most titles
        tend to be made up of the same set of elements: for example a
        Customer's name might be the concatenation of their customer first
        name and their ;ast name. For these the <classname>@Title</classname>
        annotation can be used:</para>

        <para><programlisting>public class Customer {
  @Title
  public String getFirstName() { ... }
  @Title
  public String getLastName() { ... }
  ...
}</programlisting></para>

        <para>For more control, the order of the title components can be
        specified using a sequence number (specified in Dewey decimal
        format):</para>

        <programlisting>public class Customer {
  @Title("1.0")
  public String getFirstName() { ... }
  @Title("1.1")
  public String getLastName() { ... }
  ...
}</programlisting>

        <para>For more control the title can be declared imperately using the
        <literal moreinfo="none">title()</literal> method (returning a
        <literal moreinfo="none">String</literal>). This leaves the programmer
        needs to make use of the <literal moreinfo="none">toString()</literal>
        method for other purposes, such as for debugging. For example, to
        return the title for a customer which is their last name and then
        first initial of their first name, we could use:</para>

        <para><programlisting>public class Customer {
  public String title() {
    return getLastName() + ", " + getFirstName().substring(0,1);
  } 
  ...
}</programlisting></para>

        <para>The applib contains a class,
        <classname>org.apache.isis.applib.util.TitleBuffer</classname>, which
        you can use to help create title strings if you so wish. See <xref

        <title condition=".net">How to specify the icon for an object's
        class</title>

        <para condition="1.5">By default, the framework will look for an image
        in the <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">images</filename>
        directory (either from the classpath or from the filesystem) that has
        the same name as the object class. Multiple file extensions are
        searched for, including <filename>.png</filename>,
        <filename>.gif</filename> and <filename>.jpg</filename> (in order of
        preference). For example, fan object of type
        <classname>Customer</classname> it will look for <filename
        class="directory" moreinfo="none">Customer.png</filename>, <filename
        class="directory" moreinfo="none">Customer.gif</filename>,
        <filename>Customer.jpg</filename> etc.</para>

        <para condition="1.5">If the framework finds no such file, then it
        will work up the inheritance hierarchy to see if there is an icon
        matching the name of any of the super-classes, and use that instead.
        If no matching icon is found then the framework will look for an image
        called <filename class="directory"
        moreinfo="none">default.png</filename>,
        <filename>default.gif</filename> or <filename>default.jpg</filename>
        in the images directory, and if this has not been specified, then the
        framework will use its own default image for an icon.</para>

        <para>We strongly recommend that you adopt 'pascal case' as the
        convention for icon file names: if you have a class called <classname
        condition="vb"> OrderLine</classname>, then call the icon <filename
        class="directory" moreinfo="none">OrderLine.png</filename>. Actually,
        the framework will also recognise <filename class="directory"
        moreinfo="none">orderline.png</filename>, but some operating systems
        and deployment environments are case sensitive, so it is good practice
        to adopt an unambiguous convention.</para>

        <para>Alternatively, you can use the <literal
        moreinfo="none">iconName</literal>() method instead:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">public String iconName() {
    return "Person";
}</programlisting>

        <para>This makes it easy for more than one class to use the same icon,
        without having to duplicate the image file.</para>

      <sect1>
        <title>How to specify the icon for an individual object's
        state</title>

        <para>As discussed in <xref
        linkend="sec.HowToSpecifyTheIconForAnObjectsClass" />, the
        <code>iconName()</code> method may be used to specify an object. The
        value returned from this method need not be static, and so it can be
        used to represent the state of an individual object.</para>

        <para>For example, an instance of <classname>Product</classname> could
        use a photograph of the product as an icon, using:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">public class Product {
    public String iconName() {
        return "Product-" + getPhotograph();
    }
    ...
}</programlisting>

        <para>Alternatively, an <classname>Order</classname> might vary the
        icon according to the status of the object:<programlisting>public class Order {
    public String iconName() {
        return "Order-" + getStatus();
    }
    ...
}</programlisting></para>

        <title condition="j#">How to specify a name and/or description for an
        object</title>

        <para>By default, the name (or type) of an object, as displayed to the
        user will be the class name. However, if an <literal
        moreinfo="none">@Named</literal> annotation is included, then this
        will override the default name. This might be used to include
        punctuation or other characters that may not be used within a class
        name, or when - for whatever reason - the name of the class includes
        technical artifacts (for example project-defined prefixes or
        suffices). It is also useful if the required name cannot be used
        because it is a keyword in the language.</para>

        <para>By default the framework will create a plural version of the
        object name by adding an 's' to singular name, or a 'ies' to names
        ending 'y'. For irregular nouns or other special case, the
        <code>@Plural</code> annotation may be used to specify the plural form
        of the name explicitly.t</para>

        <para>The programmer may optionally also provide a <literal
        moreinfo="none">@DescribedAs</literal> annotations, containing a brief
        description of the object's purpose, from a user perspective. The
        framework will make this available to the user in a form appropriate
        to the user interface style - for example as a tooltip.</para>

        <para>For example:</para>

        <programlisting>@Named("Customer")
@Plural("Customers")
@DescribedAs("Individuals or organizations that have either "+
             "purchased from us in the past or "+

        moreinfo="none">org.apache.isis.applib.DomainObjectContainer</literal>
        interface. See <xref linkend="apx.DomainObjectContainer" /> for the
        full list of methods provided by
        <classname>DomainObjectContainer</classname>.</para>

        <para>This interface defines the following methods for managing domain

            newTransientInstance(final Class&lt;T&gt;

            <para>Returns a new instance of the specified class, that is
            transient (unsaved). The object may subsequently be saved either
            by the user invoking the Save action (that will automatically be

          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para><methodname>boolean isPersistent()</methodname></para>

            <para>Checks whether an object has already been persisted. This is
            often useful in controlling visibility or availability of
            properties or actions.</para>

          <listitem>
            <para><methodname>void persist(Object

            <para>It is an error to persist an object if it is already
            persistent; this method will persist only if the object is not
            already persistent (otherwise it will do nothing).</para>

          <listitem>
            <para><methodname>void remove(Object

          <listitem>
            <para><methodname>void removeIfNotAlready(Object
            domainObject)</methodname></para>

            <para>It is an error to remove an object if it is not persistent;
            this method will remove only if the object is known to be
            persistent (otherwise it will do nothing).</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>A domain object specifies that it needs to have a reference to
        the <classname>DomainObjectContainer</classname> injected into by
        including the following code:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">private DomainObjectContainer container;
protected DomainObjectContainer getContainer() {
    return container;
}
public final void setContainer(final DomainObjectContainer container) {
    this.container = container;
}</programlisting>

        <para>Creating or deleting objects is then done by invoking those
        methods on the container. For example the following code would then
        create a new <classname>Customer</classname> object within another
        method:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">Customer newCust = getContainer().newTransientInstance(Customer.class);
newCust.setName("Charlie");
getContainer().persist(newCust);</programlisting>

        <para>If you are able to make your domain object inherit from <literal
        moreinfo="none">org.apache.isis.applib.AbstractDomainObject</literal>
        then you have direct access to those methods, so the code would
        become:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">Customer newCust = newTransientInstance(Customer.class);
newCust.setName("Charlie");
persist(newCust);</programlisting>

        <para>As an alternative to putting the creation logic within your
        domain objects, you could alternatively delegate to an injected
        factory (see <xref linkend="chp.DomainServices" />). Ultimately
        factories just delegate back to
        <classname>DomainObjectContainer</classname> in the same way, so from
        a technical standpoint there is little difference. However it is
        generally worth introducing a factory because it provides a place to
        centralize any business logic. It also affords the opportunity to
        introduce a domain term (eg <classname>ProductCatalog</classname> or
        <classname>StudentRegister</classname>), thereby reinforcing the
        "ubiquitous language".</para>

        <para>These methods are actually provided by the
        <classname>org.apache.isis.applib.AbstractContainedObject</classname>
        and so are also available on <literal
        moreinfo="none">org.apache.isis.applib.AbstractService</literal> (and,
        hence, on <literal
        moreinfo="none">org.apache.isis.applib.AbstractFactoryAndRepository</literal>)
        for creating objects within a service.</para>

        <warning>
          <para>It is possible to create a transient object within another
          transient object. When the framework persists any transient object,
          by default it will automatically persist any other transient object
          referenced by that object. However, if any of these transient
          objects are to be exposed to the user (while in their transient
          state), then you need to write your code very carefully -
          anticipating the fact that the user could elect to save any of the
          transient objects at any point - which could cause the graph of
          related objects to be persisted in an invalid state.</para>

          <para>The recommended approach is, if possible, to mark these
          supplementary classes as not persistable by the user (see <xref
          linkend="not-persistable" />), or not to permit the user to create a
          new transient object that is a child of an existing transient
          object, but, rather, to require the user to save the parent object
          first.</para>

      <sect1 id="sec.LifecycleMethods">
        <title>How to insert behaviour into the object life cycle</title>

        <para><emphasis>Apache Isis</emphasis> is responsible for managing the
        object lifecycle, persisting, updating or removing objects from the
        persistent object store as required. For many applications the domain
        objects are unaware of this. If required, though, an object can
        provide callback methods (all optional) so that the framework can

        <para>The <classname>DomainObjectContainer</classname> provides the

        the value of a property or a collection. In earlier versions of the

        <title>How to ensure object is in valid state</title>

        <para>A <methodname>validate()</methodname> method may be added to
        provided validation at object level, prior to making an object
        persistent.</para>

        <para>The syntax is:</para>

        <programlisting>public String validate()</programlisting>

        <para>A non-<code>null</code> value is the taken to be the reason why
        the object cannot be saved.</para>

        <para>This is particularly useful for validating fields in relation to
        each other.</para>

        <para>For example:</para>

        <programlisting>public class Booking {
    private Date fromDate;
    public Date getFromDate() {...}
    public void setFromDate(Date d) {...}
    
    private Date toDate;
    public Date getToDate() {...}
    public void setToDate(Date d) {...}

    public String validate() {
        if (fromDate.getTicks() &gt; toDate.getTicks()) {
            return "From Date cannot be after To Date";
        }
        return null;
    }
    ...
}</programlisting>

        <para>This will prevent the user from saving a transient
        <code>Booking</code> where the From Date falls after the To Date. Note
        that in this example, the two date properties could also have their
        own individual validate methods - for example in order to test that
        each date was after today.</para>

        <warning>
          <para>At the time of writing, the <code>validate()</code> method is
          called only when the object is first saved, not when it is
          subsequently updated. For validation of subsequent updates, the
          workaround is necessary to build the validation logic into the
          individual property validation methods (though these could delegate
          to a common <code>validate()</code> method).</para>

      </abstract>

      <para>The following conventions are concerned with specifying the
      properties of a domain entity, and the means by which a user can
      interact with those properties.</para>

      <sect1>
        <title>How to add a property to an object</title>

        <para>Properties are specified using the JavaBean conventions,
        recognizing a standard accessor/mutator pair (<code>get</code> and
        <code>set</code>).</para>

        <para>The syntax is:</para>

        <para><programlisting>public PropertyType getPropertyName() 

public void setPropertyName(PropertyType param)</programlisting></para>

        <para>where <literal moreinfo="none">PropertyType</literal> is a
        primitive, a value object or an entity object.</para>

        <para>Properties may either be for a value type or may reference
        another entity. Values include Java primitives, and JDK classes with
        value semantics (eg <literal
        moreinfo="none">java.lang.Strings</literal> and <literal
        moreinfo="none">java.util.Dates</literal>; see <xref
        linkend="chp.ValueTypes" /> for the full list). It is also possible to
        write your own value types (see <xref linkend="chp.ValueTypes" />). A
        property referencing another domain object is sometimes called an
        association.</para>

        <para>For example, the following example contains both a value
        (<literal moreinfo="none">String</literal>) property and a reference

          <para>For example:</para>

          other information available to the object. It also happens to be
          compatible with Java Persistence Api (<acronym>JPA</acronym>)
          semantics.</para>

          <para>For example:</para>

          <programlisting format="linespecific">public class Employee {
    public Department getDepartment() { ... }
    ...

    // this is the derived property
    public Employee getManager() {
        if (getDepartment() == null) { return null; }
        return getDepartment().getManager();
    }
    ...
}</programlisting>

          <para>Although there is no setter, such properties can nevertheless
          be modified if a modifyXxx supporting method is provided:</para>

          <programlisting format="linespecific">public class Employee {
    public Department getDepartment() { ... }
    ...

    // this is the derived property
    public Employee getManager() { ... }

    // this makes the derived property modifiable
    public void modifyManager(Employee manager) {
        if (getDepartment() == null) { return; }
        getDepartment().modifyManager(manager);
    }

    ...
}</programlisting>

          <para>Note how the implementation of such a modifyXxx() method
          typically modifies the original source of the information (the
          <classname>Department</classname> object).</para>

          <title>Eagerly derived</title>

          <para>An alternative to omitting the mutator is to mark a property
          is to keep the mutator, but to annotate the property with
          <classname>@NotPersisted</classname>.</para>

          <para>Because the data is non-persisted, some other mechanism must
          be used to initialize the property. Typically this will be a
          lifecycle method (see <xref linkend="sec.LifecycleMethods" />),
          which eagerly derive the value of the property.</para>

          <para>For example:</para>

          <programlisting format="linespecific">public class Employee {
    public void loaded() {
        if (getDepartment() != null) { 
            setManager(getDepartment().getManager());
        }
    }

    public Department getDepartment() { ... }
    ...

    @NotPersisted
    public Employee getManager() { ... }
    private void setManager(Employee manager) { ... }
    ...
}</programlisting>

          <para>Eagerly derived properties can be made modifiable either
          changing the setter to have public visibility, or introducing a
          modifyXxx() method.</para>

        <title>How to specify a set of choices for a property</title>

        <para>The simplest way to provide the user with a set of choices for a

        ensure that the type used by the property is marked up as
        <code>@Bounded</code> (see <xref linkend="sec.Bounded" />).</para>

        <para>However, this is not always appropriate. For example you might
        wish to provide the user with the choice of all the
        <classname>Address</classname>es known for that
        <classname>Customer</classname>, with the most recently-used address
        as the default.</para>

        <para>The syntax for specifying a list of choices is either:</para>

        <para><programlisting>public Collection&lt;PropertyType&gt; choicesPropertyName()</programlisting></para>

        <para>or alternatively</para>

        <programlisting>public PropertyType[] choicesPropertyName()</programlisting>

        <para>where <literal moreinfo="none">PropertyType</literal> is the
        same type as that of the property itself.</para>

        <para>For example:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">public class Order {
    public Address getShippingAddress() { ... }
    public void setShippingAddress() { ... }

        <title>How to trigger other behaviour when a property is

        <para>If you want to invoke functionality whenever a property is
        changed by the user, then you should create a supporting <literal
        moreinfo="none">modifyXxx()</literal> method and include the
        functionality within that. The syntax is:</para>

        <programlisting>public void modifyPropertyName(PropertyType param)</programlisting>

        <para>Why not just put this functionality in the setter? Well, the
        setter is used by the object store to recreate the state of an already
        persisted object. Putting additional behaviour in the setter would
        cause it to be triggered incorrectly.</para>

        <para>For example:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">public class Order() {
    public Integer getAmount() { ... }
    public void setAmount(Integer amount) { ... }
    public void modifyAmount(Integer amount) {
        setAmount(amount);
        addToTotal(amount);
    }
    ...
}</programlisting>

        <para>Here the <literal moreinfo="none">modifyAmount()</literal>
        method also calls the <literal moreinfo="none">addToTotal()</literal>
        call as well as the <literal moreinfo="none">setAmount()</literal>
        method. We don't want this <methodname>addToCall()</methodname> method
        to be called when pulling the object back from the object store, so we
        put it into the modify, not the setter.</para>

        <para>You may optionally also specify a <code>clearXxx()</code> which
        works the same way as modify <literal moreinfo="none">modify</literal>
        <literal moreinfo="none">Xxx()</literal> but is called when the
        property is cleared by the user (i.e. the current value replaced by
        nothing). The syntax is:</para>

        <programlisting>public void clearPropertyName()</programlisting>

        <para>To extend the above example:</para>

      <para>A collection is a list of references to several entity that have a

        <para>A collection is recognized via an accessor/mutator method pair
        (<code>get</code> and set) for any type of collection provided by the

        <para>The syntax is either:</para>

private void setCollectionName(Set&lt;EntityType&gt; param)</programlisting></para>

        <para>A mutator is required, but it need only have

        <para>It is recommended that the collections be specified using
        generics (for example: <literal
        moreinfo="none">List&lt;Customer&gt;</literal> ). That way the
        framework will be able to display the collection based on that type
        definition. If a raw type is used then the framework will attempt to
        infer the type from the addToXxx() / removeFromXxx() supporting
        methods, if specified (see <xref linkend="sec.AddToRemoveFrom" />). If
        the framework is unable to determine the type of the collection, it
        will mean that some viewers will represent the collection is a less
        sophisticated manner (eg a simple list of titles rather than a
        table).</para>

          <title>Specifying the name for a collection</title>

          <para>By default the framework will use the collection name itself
          to label the collection on the user interface. If you wish to
          override this, use the <literal moreinfo="none">@Named</literal>
          annotation on the collection.</para>

          <para>For example:</para>

          <programlisting format="linespecific">public class Customer {
    @Named("Placed Orders")
    public List&lt;Order&gt; getOrders() { ... }

        <sect2>
          <title>Specifying a description for a collection</title>

          <para>An additional description can be provided on a collection
          using the <literal moreinfo="none">@DescribedAs</literal>
          annotation. The framework will take responsibility to make this
          description available to the user, for example in the form of a
          tooltip.</para>

          <para>For example:</para>

          <programlisting format="linespecific">public class Customer {
    @DescribedAs("Those orders that have been placed (and possibly shipped) " +

        <title>How to make a derived collection</title>

        <para>Collections can be derived by omitting the mutator (the same way

        <para>For example:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">public class Department {

    // Derived collection
    public List&lt;Employee&gt; getTerminatedEmployees() {
        List&lt;Employee&gt; terminatedEmployees = new ArrayList&lt;Employee&gt;();
        for(Employee e: employees) {
            if (e.isTerminated()) {

            }
        }
        return terminatedEmployees;
    }
    ...
}</programlisting>

        <para>Derived collections are not persisted, though may be modified if
        there is an addToXxx() or removeFromXxx() supporting method. As for
        derived properties, the implementations of these mutators change the
        underlying data. For example:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">public class Department {
    ...

    public void addToTerminatedEmployees(Employee employee) {
        employee.setTerminated(true);

          <para>Some, though not all, viewers allow the user to directly

          <para>Although it is possible to associate behaviour with such

          <para>A <literal moreinfo="none">hideXxx()</literal> method can be
          used to indicate that a particular object's action should be hidden
          under certain conditions, typically relating to the state of that
          instance.</para>

          <para>The syntax is:</para>

          <programlisting><literal moreinfo="none">public boolean hideActionName([ValueOrEntityType param] ...)</literal> </programlisting>

          <para>where the parameter types should match the action itself
          (allowing for overloading)</para>

          <para>or</para>

          <programlisting><literal moreinfo="none">public boolean hideActionName()</literal> </programlisting>

          <para>which applies to (all overloaded versions of) the
          action.</para>

          <para>in both cases, returning a value of <code>true</code>

        <title>How to prevent an action from being invoked</title>

        <para>Preventing the user from invoking an action is known as
        'disabling' the action.</para>

        <para>The mechanism for disabling an action is broadly the same as for
        disabling a property (see <xref linkend="sec.DisabledProperty" />) or

        <sect2>
          <title>Disabling an action permanently</title>

          <para>It is possible to prevent an action from ever being invoked
          using the <classname>@Disabled</classname> annotation, exactly
          equivalent to the use of the annotation for properties and
          collections. However, it's not a particularly meaningful usecase:
          why display an action that can never be invoked? The only reason we
          can think of is as a placeholder during prototyping - to indicate to
          the user that an action is planned, but has not yet been
          implemented.</para>

          <para>Whereas annotating an action simply as

          <para>There may be circumstances in which we do not want the user to
          be able to initiate the action at all - for example because that
          action is not appropriate to the current state of the object on

        <title>How to specify names and/or descriptions for an action
        parameter</title>

        <para>Unlike with properties, the framework cannot pick up the names
        of parameters that you use within the domain code. By default
        parameters will be labelled only with the type of the object required
        (e.g. 'String:' or 'Customer:)</para>

        <para>If you want a parameter to have a different name (such as 'First
        Name', 'Last Name') then that parameter should be marked up with an
        <literal moreinfo="none">@Named</literal> annotation - very often
        taking the same form as the parameter name used in the code.
        Alternatively though, you could create a user-defined value type,
        using <literal>@Value</literal> (see <xref
        linkend="chp.ValueTypes" />).</para>

        <para>Similarly, any parameter may be given a short user-description
        using the <literal moreinfo="none">@DescribedAs</literal> annotation.
        The framework takes responsibility to make this available to the
        user.</para>

        <para>For example:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">public class Customer {
    public Order placeOrder(
            Product p, 
            @Named("Quantity")
            @DescribedAs("The number of units of the specified product in this order")

            specify the typical number of characters that are likely to be
            stored within a <classname>String</classname> parameter. Viewers
            are expected to use this as a hint as to the size of the field to
            render for the parameter.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>the <literal moreinfo="none">@MultiLine</literal> annotation

            field).</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>For example:</para>

        <sect2>
          <title>Imperative validation</title>

          <para>A <literal moreinfo="none">validateXxx()</literal> method is
          used to check that the set of arguments used by an action method is
          valid. If the arguments are invalid then the framework will not
          invoke the action.</para>

          <para>The syntax is:</para>

          <para><programlisting>public String validate&lt;ActionName&gt;([ValueOrEntityType param]...)</programlisting></para>

          <para>A non-<code>null</code> return <classname>String</classname>
          indicates the reason why the member cannot be modified/action be
          invoked, and the viewing mechanism will display this feedback to the
          user.</para>

          <para>For example:</para>

          <programlisting format="linespecific">public class Customer {
    public Order placeOrder(Product p, int quantity) { ... }
    public String validatePlaceOrder(Product p, int quantity) {

        if (quantity &lt;= 0) { return "Quantity must be a positive value"; }
        return null;
    }
    ...

        <para>Generally it is not good practice to embed knowledge of roles
        and/or users into the domain classes; instead, this should be the
        responsibility of the framework or platform and should be specified
        and administered externally to the domain model. However, in rare
        circumstances it might be necessary or pragmatic to implement access
        control within the domain model.</para>

        <para>The current user can be obtained from
        <classname>DomainObjectContainer</classname>, using its
        <methodname>getUser()</methodname> method. Alternatively, if the
        domain object inherits from
        <classname>AbstractDomainObject</classname>, then
        <methodname>getUser()</methodname> is also inherited. In either case
        the method returns an object of type
        <methodname>org.apache.isis.security.UserMemento</methodname>, which
        holds both username and the set of roles for that user. The full
        details of the security classes can be found in <xref
        linkend="apx.SecurityClasses" />.</para>

        <para>The mechanism to apply a business rule is just to return an
        appropriate value from a supporting

        <methodname>disableXxx()</methodname> or
        <methodname>validateXxx()</methodname> method.</para>

              !getUser().hasRole("MODIFY_SALARY")?

        <title>How to pass a messages and errors back to the user</title>

        <para>Sometimes, within an action it is necessary or desirable to pass

      <para>This chapter contains how-to's for programming conventions that
      writing domain services (by which we also mean repositories and
      factories); ie everything that isn't a domain object or a value
      type.</para>

      <para>Domain services are instantiated once and once only by the
      framework, and are used to centralize any domain logic that does not
      logically belong in a domain entity or value. <emphasis>Isis</emphasis>
      will automatically inject services into every domain entity that
      requests them, and into each other.</para>

      <sect1 id="sec.AbstractService">
        <title>How to not inherit from framework classes</title>

        <para>Like entities, it isn't mandatory for domain services to inherit
        from any framework superclass; they can be plain-old pojos if
        required. However, again, like entities, they do at a minimum need to
        have a
        <classname>org.apache.isis.applib.DomainObjectContainer</classname>
        injected into them (an interface), from which other framework services
        can be accessed.</para>

        <para>If you don't have a requirement to inherit from any other
        superclass, then it usually makes sense to inherit from one of the
        abstract classes in the applib, either
        <classname>org.apache.isis.applib.AbstractService</classname> or
        <classname>org.apache.isis.applib.AbstractRepositoryAndFactory</classname>.
        These already supports the
        <classname>DomainObjectContainer</classname> and have a number of
        convenience helper methods.</para>

        <para>The <acronym>UML</acronym> class diagram below shows the

        <para>All domain services (which includes repositories and factories)
        should be registered in the isis.properties configuration file, under
        the <varname>isis.services.prefix</varname> (a common package name)
        and <varname>isis.services</varname> key (a comma-separated

        <title>How to inject services into entities</title>

        <para>All that is required to inject a service into an entity (or
        indeed into another service) is to provide an appropriately typed
        setter. The name of the method does not matter, only that it is
        prefixed "set", is public, and has a single parameter of the correct
        type.</para>

        <para>For example:</para>

        <programlisting>public class Customer {
    private OrderRepository orderRepository;
    public void setOrderRepository(OrderRepository orderRepository) {
        this.orderRepository = orderRepository;
    }
    ...
}</programlisting>

        <para>Note that we consider
        <classname>DomainObjectContainer</classname> to be a service too;
        hence it can be injected in exactly the same manner.</para>
      </sect1>

      <sect1>
        <title>How to write a typical domain service</title>

        <para>Services consist of a set of logically grouped actions, and as
        such follow the same conventions as for entities (see <xref
        linkend="chp.Actions" />). However, a service cannot have (persisted)
        properties, nor can it have (persisted) collections.</para>

        <para>For convenience you can inherit from
        <classname>AbstractService</classname> or one of its subclasses (see
        <xref linkend="sec.AbstractService" />), but this is not
        mandatory.</para>

        <sect2>
          <title>The <methodname>getId()</methodname> method</title>

          <para>Optionally, a service may provide a
          <methodname>getId()</methodname> method:</para>

          <programlisting>public String getId()</programlisting>

          <para>This method returns a logical identifier for a service,
          independent of its implementation. Currently it used only by
          perspectives, providing a label by which to record the services that
          are available for a current user's profile. See <xref

          perspectives.</para>

        <sect2>
          <title>(Suppressing) contributed actions</title>

          <para>Any n-parameter action provided by a service will
          automatically be contributed to the list of actions for each of its
          (entity) parameters. From the viewpoint of the entity the action is
          called a contributed action.</para>

          <para>For example, given a service:</para>

          <programlisting>public interface Library {
    public Loan borrow(Loanable l, Borrower b);
}</programlisting>

          <para>and the entities:</para>

          <programlisting>public class Book implements Loanable { ... }y</programlisting>

          <para>and</para>

          <programlisting>public class LibraryMember implements Borrower { ... }</programlisting>

          <para>then the <methodname>borrow(...)</methodname> action will be
          contributed to both <classname>Book</classname> and to
          <classname>LibraryMember</classname>.</para>

          <para>This is an important capability because it helps to decouple
          the concrete classes from the services.</para>

          <para>If necessary, though, this behaviour can be suppressed by
          annotating the service action with
          <classname>@org.apache.isis.applib.annotations.NotContributed</classname>.</para>

          <para>For example:</para>

          <programlisting>public interface Library {
    @NotContributed
    public Loan borrow(Loanable l, Borrower b);
}</programlisting>

          <para>If annotated at the interface level, then the annotation will
          be inherited by every concrete class. Alternatively the annotation
          can be applied at the implementation class level and only apply to
          that particular implementation.</para>

          <para>Note that an action annotated as being
          <classname>@NotContributed</classname> will still appear in the
          service menu for the service. If an action should neither be
          contributed nor appear in service menu items, then simply annotate
          it as <classname>@Hidden</classname>.</para>
        </sect2>

        <sect2>
          <title>(Suppressing) service menu items</title>

          <para>By default every action of a service (by which we also mean
          repositories and factories) will be rendered in the viewer, eg as a
          menu item for that service menu. This behaviour can be suppressed by
          annotating the action using
          <classname>@org.apache.isis.applib.annotations.NotInServiceMenu</classname>.</para>

          <para>For example:</para>

          <programlisting>public interface Library {
    @NotInServiceMenu
    public Loan borrow(Loanable l, Borrower b);
}</programlisting>

          <para>Note that an action annotated as being
          <classname>@NotInServiceMenu</classname> will still be contributed.
          If an action should neither be contributed nor appear in service
          menu items, then simply annotate it as
          <classname>@Hidden</classname>.</para>
        </sect2>

        <sect2>
          <title>(Suppressing) service menus</title>

          <para>If none of the service menu items should appear, then the
          service itself should be annotated as @Hidden.</para>

          <para>For example:</para>

          <programlisting>@Hidden
public interface EmailService {
    public void sendEmail(String to, String from, String subject, String body);
    public void forwardEmail(String to, String from, String subject, String body);

        <title>How to use a generic repository</title>

        <para>To speed up initial prototype the framework allows so-called
        generic repositories to be defined, one per entity. Such a repository
        will, for its specified type, provide methods to:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Create a new transient instance</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Create a new persisted instance</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Find all persisted instances</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Find instances with a specified title</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>To register such a service prefix the class name with the prefix
        <literal>repository#</literal>.</para>

        <para>For example:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">isis.services = repository#dom.Booking</programlisting>

        <para>Over time, you should expect most if not all of these generic
        repositories will be replaced with regular repository types (see <xref
        linkend="sec.CustomRepository" />).</para>
      </sect1>

      <sect1 id="sec.CustomRepository">
        <title>How to write a custom repository</title>

        <para>Repositories are defined as interfaces within the domain, and
        their implementation will vary by object store. During prototyping and
        for much of development, you will probably find it easiest to use an
        in-memory object store or perhaps the <acronym>XML</acronym> object
        store, with only a small number of instances. The
        <classname>DomainObjectContainer</classname> provides a set of methods
        that make it easy to pull back all instances from the object store
        which can then be filtered as required. Later on, you can replace the
        implementation depending upon the specifics of the object store that
        you'll be using for production.</para>

        <para>If you inherit from the <literal
        moreinfo="none">org.apache.isis.applib.AbstractFactoryAndRepository</literal>
        adapter class then this will automatically have the
        <classname>DomainObjectContainer</classname> injected, and provides
        convenience methods that delegate to the container. Using this is not
        mandatory, however.</para>

        <para>The methods provided by the
        <classname>DomainObjectContainer</classname> to support repositories
        are:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para><methodname>allInstances(Class&lt;T&gt;
            ofType)</methodname></para>

            <para>Returns all instances of the specified type. Note that this
            includes all instances of any subtypes.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para><methodname>allMatches(...)</methodname></para>

            <para>Returns all instances matching the provided
            arguments.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para><methodname>firstMatch(...)</methodname></para>

          <listitem>
            <para><methodname>uniqueMatch(...)</methodname></para>

            arguments (else is an exception).</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>The last three methods, <methodname>*Match(...)</methodname> are
        all overloaded in order to return a subset of object instances. Some
        of these are "naive"; all instances are returned from the object
        store, and the filtering is performed within the repository. Others
        are designed to pass the query predicate back to the object store so
        that only the matching rows are returned.</para>

        <para>Each of these options are discussed in more detail below.</para>

        <sect2>
          <title>Finding by Title</title>

          <para>The first version of finding instances is to specify the
          required title for the matching objects:</para>

          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para><methodname>allMatches(Class&lt;T&gt; ofType, String
              title)</methodname></para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para><methodname>firstMatch(Class&lt;T&gt; ofType, String
              title)</methodname></para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para><methodname>uniqueMatch(Class&lt;T&gt; ofType, String
              title)</methodname></para>
            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist>

          <para>Although easy and intuitive, this isn't generally recommended
          for production use because (a) the matching is performed within the
          repository rather than the object store, and (b) the title string
          can often change as business requirements are refined.</para>

          <para>That said, it is possible to eliminate the first disadvantage
          by using the <classname>Query</classname> API, discussed below; this
          provides an implementation that is equivalent to find by
          title.</para>
        </sect2>

        <sect2>
          <title>Finding by Pattern</title>

          <para>The next technique of finding instances is to specify pattern
          object to match against (sometimes called "query-by-example", or
          <acronym>QBE</acronym>):</para>

          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para><methodname>allMatches(Class&lt;T&gt; ofType, Object
              pattern)</methodname></para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para><methodname>firstMatch(Class&lt;T&gt; ofType, Object
              pattern)</methodname></para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para><methodname>uniqueMatch(Class&lt;T&gt; ofType, Object
              pattern)</methodname></para>
            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist>

          <para>Any non-null value of the pattern object is used as the
          predicate.</para>

          <para>Although more robust that searching by title, this technique
          is also not likely to be valid for production code because the
          matching is still performed within the repository rather than within
          the object store.</para>

          <para>That said, it is possible to eliminate the first disadvantage
          by using the <classname>Query</classname> API, discussed below; this

          pattern.</para>

          <note>
            <para>If the pattern object is created using
            <methodname>newTransientInstance(...)</methodname>, then any
            default values for properties will automatically be set (see <xref

            they will need to be manually cleared.</para>

          <para>The <classname>Filter&lt;T&gt;</classname> interface is very
          straightforward:</para>

          <programlisting>public interface Filter&lt;T&gt; {
    public boolean accept(T obj);
}</programlisting>

          <para>Every object of the given type (and subclasses) is passed into
          the <classname>Filter</classname> instance; only those
          <methodname>accept()</methodname>'ed are returned from the

          <para>Although flexible, with this technique the matching is also
          performed within the repository rather than the object store, and so
          is also likely not to be suitable for production use where there are

          <para>The finaly overloaded version of the matching methods take an

          interface:</para>

            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist>

          <para>Unlike all the other matching mechanisms, the point of the
          <classname>Query</classname> interface is for it to be passed back
          to the object store and evaluated there.</para>

          <para>The applib provides several implementations that implement the
          <classname>Query&lt;T&gt;</classname> interface. Probably the most
          important of these is <classname>QueryDefault&lt;T&gt;</classname>,
          which provides a set of factory methods for constructing
          <classname>Query</classname> instances that represent a named query
          with a map of parameter/argument pairs.</para>

          <para>For example:</para>

          <programlisting>public class CustomerRepositoryImpl implements CustomerRepository {
    public List&lt;Customer&gt; findCustomers(
            @Named("Last Name") String lastName,
            @Named("Postcode")  String postCode
        ) {
        QueryDefault&lt;Customer&gt; query = 
            QueryDefault.create(
                Customer.class, 
                "findCustomers", 
                "lastName", lastName, 
                "postCode", postCode);

        return getContainer().allMatches(query);
    }
    ...
}</programlisting>

          <para>Above it was noted that the other overloaded versions of the
          matching <acronym>API</acronym> have the disadvantage that the
          matching is performed within the repository. As an alternative to
          using "find by title" or "find by pattern", you may wish to use
          QueryFindByTitle and QueryFind</para>

          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para><classname>QueryFindByTitle&lt;T&gt;</classname>, which
              corresponds to the <methodname>allMatches(...)</methodname> for
              searching by title</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para><classname>QueryFindByPattern&lt;T&gt;</classname>, which

              searching by pattern</para>
            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist>

          <para>There is also a
          <classname>QueryFindAllInstances&lt;T&gt;</classname>, which
          corresponds to the <methodname>allInstances()</methodname>
          method.</para>

          <para>The interpretation of a <classname>Query</classname> instance
          ultimately depends on the object store. All object stores will
          support <classname>QueryFindAllInstances</classname>, and most will
          provide a mechanism to support <classname>QueryDefault</classname>.
          Check the object store documentation to determine whether they
          support other <classname>Query</classname> implementations (ie,
          <classname>QueryFindByTitle</classname> and
          <classname>QueryFindByPattern</classname>).</para>

        <title>Factories</title>

        <para>Like repositories, factories are defined by interface in the
        domain, decoupling the domain objects from their actual
        implementation. Unlike repositories, there is no particular need to
        change the implementation when moving from one object store to
        another, because in all cases the factory can simply delegate to its
        injected <classname>DomainObjectContainer</classname>.</para>

        <para>The methods for <classname>DomainObjectContainer</classname>
        that are relevant for a factory are:</para>

      <title>Value Types</title>

      <abstract>
        <para>Built-in value types, writing your own value types, and
        supporting third-party value types.</para>
      </abstract>

      <para>The state of any given entity is characterized by properties
      (<xref linkend="chp.Properties" />) and collections (<xref
      linkend="chp.Collections" />). A collections is a one-to-many reference
      to another entities, while a property is either a one-to-one reference
      to another entity, or it is a value.</para>

      <para>But what's a value? Well, it's an atomic piece of state. A string
      is a value, so is a number, so is a date. Values should be designed to
      be immutable (though some system value types, such as
      <classname>java.util.Date</classname>, famously are not).</para>

      <para><emphasis>Isis</emphasis> supports all the standard JDK value
      types, and defines a number of its own (eg
      <classname>Percentage</classname> and <classname>Color</classname>). It
      also allows you to define your own value types, such as
      <classname>LastName</classname>, or <classname>Celsius</classname>, or
      <classname>ComplexNumber</classname>.</para>

      <para>Finally, it's also possible to make Isis integrate with
      third-party value types, such as <ulink
      url="http://joda-time.sourceforge.net/">JodaTime</ulink>.</para>

      <para><note>
          <para><emphasis>Isis</emphasis>' support for a particular value type
          does not necessarily imply that there is a custom widget for that
          type in a particular viewer. Rather, it means that the state of the
          object can be serialized, is expected to have equal-by-content
          semantics, and is expected to be immutable. It may also be parseable
          from a string.</para>

        <title>Custom Value Types</title>

        <para>In addition to the built-in value types it is also possible to
        define user-defined value types. This is typically done using the
        <classname>@Value</classname> annotation.</para>

        <para>The <literal>@Value</literal> annotation is used to provide an
        implementation of the
        <classname>org.apache.isis.applib.adapters.ValueSemanticsProvider</classname>
        interface. In turn this provides objects that allow the framework to
        interact with the value, specifically:</para>

            <para>This is used by some object stores (eg the
            <acronym>XML</acronym> Object Store), for remoting and also by the

            <para>This is used as a fallback by viewers that do not have any
            specific widgets to support the particular value type, and make do
            with a simple text field instead.</para>

            <para>An obvious example is to parse a date. But it could be used
            to parse "TRUE" and "FALSE" into a boolean (as opposed to using a

            <para>Not every value type will have a default, but some do (eg
            false for a boolean, 0 for a number). This is used as the default
            value for non-<classname>@Optional</classname> properties and

        <para>Third party value types, such as those in <ulink
        url="http://joda-time.sourceforge.net/">JodaTime</ulink>, can also
        supported, again through the use of a
        <classname>ValueSemanticsProvider</classname>. However, since the
        source code cannot be altered, the provider must be supplied using a
        key value in <methodname>isis.properties</methodname> configuration
        file.</para>

        <para>For example, the following would register a semantics provider

        <para>The default Clock and alternative implementations.</para>
      </abstract>

      <para>Many if not all enterprise applications deal with dates and times
      in one way or another. For example, if an <classname>Order</classname>
      is placed, then the <classname>Customer</classname> may have 30 days to
      pay the Invoice, otherwise a penalty may be levied. However, this can
      complicate automated testing: "today+30" will be a different date every
      time the test is run.</para>

      <para>A common solution is to require that domain objects do not go
      directly to the system for the current date (ie don't simply instantiate
      a new <classname>java.util.Date</classname> in order to get the current
      time); instead they should call some sort of facade.</para>

      <para>The <emphasis>Apache Isis</emphasis> framework provides such a
      facade through the
      <classname>org.apache.isis.applib.clock.Clock</classname> class. The
      defaults for all values refer back to the <classname>Clock</classname>,
      and - because the <classname>Clock</classname> is a singleton - it is
      easy for any application code to obtain the current time also.</para>

      <para>For example:</para>

      <programlisting>public class Customer {
     public Order placeOrder(Product p) {
         Date now = Clock.getTimeAsDate();
         ...
     }
     ...
}</programlisting>

      <sect1>
        <title>Lazily Instantiated</title>

        <para>The first call to <methodname>Clock.getTime()</methodname> will
        lazily instantiate the singleton, with the default implementation
        being one that simply delegates to the system's internal clock. To use
        a different <classname>Clock</classname> implementation, eg one that
        delegates to an NNTP server, all that is required is to instantiate it
        any time prior to bootstrapping <emphasis>Isis</emphasis>
        itself.</para>

        <para>One notable implementation that notably takes advantage of this
        is <classname>FixtureClock</classname>, used for testing. See <xref
        linkend="chp.Fixtures" /> for more information.</para>

      <sect1>
        <title>Possibly Replaceable</title>

        <para>Clock implementations can indicate whether they are replaceable
        as the singleton, or not.</para>

        <para>Most (all?) production implementations (eg the default system
        clock) are <emphasis>not</emphasis> replaceable; once instantiated,
        any attempt to instantiate another subclass will be rejected with an
        exception.</para>

        <para>However implementations to work with tests (such as
        <classname>FixtureClock</classname>, already mentioned) are more
        likely to be replaceable, so that they can be setup multiple times as
        required.</para>

      <para>As well as allowing domain entities to be persisted into object

      <emphasis>profiles</emphasis> to be persisted into a profile
      store.</para>

      <sect1>
        <title>Profiles and Perspectives</title>

        <para>Every user can have one profile associated with them, which
        consists of:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>a set of options or preferences</para>
          </listitem>

            <para>a set of perspectives</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>A perspective is something akin to a layout or desktop,
        representing a configuration of relevant objects as might be displayed
        on the home page of the viewer. In particular, perspectives allow the
        set of services available to a user (eg as icons in the
        <acronym>DnD</acronym> viewer) to be customized for that user. Since
        these services represent the "start points" for the user to interact
        with the domain model, they in a sense define an application on a
        per-user basis.</para>

        <para>The elements that make up a perspective are:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>a set of services (identified by the string returned from
            each service's <methodname>getId()</methodname> method, see <xref
            linkend="chp.DomainServices" />)</para>

            <para>These are the services (eg icons) that can be accessed from
            that perspective</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>a set of objects</para>

          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>The applib contains types to define these two concepts;
        specifically <classname>Profile</classname> and
        <classname>Perspective</classname>. These are actually interfaces, the
        implementation is provided by framework itself.</para>
      </sect1>

      <sect1>
        <title>Runtime and Viewer Support</title>

        <para>Support for profiles will vary across runtime implementations
        and across viewers. The <emphasis>default runtime</emphasis>
        implementation <emphasis>does</emphasis> support profiles, however,
        and works such that if a user logs in and no perspective exists for
        that user one will automatically be created. This will either be a
        copy of the 'template' perspective, or, if no such template exists,
        then simply a perspective containing all the known services.</para>

        <para>Moreover, the runtime must be configured to use some sort of
        persistence mechanism for profiles such that they are persisted
        between runs. The default runtime does support this (though the
        default is the in-memory profilestore that does not persist any
        information between sessions).</para>

        <para>Even if the configured runtime does support profiles, not every
        viewer necessarily uses the concept. The most notable viewer that
        <emphasis>does</emphasis> support the idea is the <emphasis>dnd
        viewer</emphasis>.</para>

          <para>The <classname>BaseFixture</classname> class is not API, but
          is responsible for instantiating
          <classname>FixtureClock</classname>. This is an implementation of
          <classname>Clock</classname> singleton, which (as described in <xref

          the current time. The <classname>FixtureClock</classname>'s purpose

          <para>The <classname>AbstractFixture</classname> class (inheriting

              <para>the <methodname>switchUser(...)</methodname> method allow

              <para>This changes the user logged-on while the fixtures are

          to <classname>AbstractFixture</classname>, just allowing the current

          <para>The main difference is one of style;
          <classname>DateFixture</classname> can be used in a declarative way,
          whereas <classname>AbstractFixture</classname> is more imperative.
          For example:</para>

          <programlisting>public class DateIs13Jan2007Fixture extends DateFixture {
    public DateIs13Jan2007Fixture() {
        super(2007,1,13);
    }

        </sect2>

        <sect2>
          <title><methodname>SwitchUserFixture</methodname></title>

          <para>The <classname>SwitchUserFixture</classname> provides an
          alternative to <classname>AbstractFixture</classname>, just allowing
          the current user to be switched.</para>

          <para>The main difference is one of style;
          <classname>SwitchUserFixture</classname> can be used in a
          declarative way, whereas <classname>AbstractFixture</classname> is
          more imperative. For example:</para>

          <programlisting>public class SwitchToFrankSupervisorFixture extends SwitchUserFixture {
    public SwitchToFrankSupervisorFixture() {
        super("frank", "user", "supervisor");
    }
}</programlisting>

          <para>A fixture in this style could then be used within a composite
          fixture hierarchy.</para>

          <warning>
            <para>Do be aware of when you call switchUser() in a
            <classname>Fixture</classname> as it causes the current
            transaction to be ended and a new one started (for the new user).
            If you share a reference between the two you will get an
            exception.</para>

            <para>For example:</para>

            <programlisting>Account account = accounts.createAccount(
    "ACME", "Peter Planner", "pplanner@acme.com");
Participant peterPlanner = account.getAdmin();
        
switchUser("pplanner@acme.com", new String[0]);

Work work = plan1.createWork();
BcpPlan plan = (BcpPlan) work.getTarget();
plan.getOwner().modifyLeader(peterPlanner);</programlisting>

            <para>This will fail because <varname>peterPlanner</varname>
            reference is no longer valid after the switch user.</para>

            <para>The solution is to retrieve the object again so it is part
            of the second transaction. In this example we can change to code
            to this:</para>

            <programlisting>accounts.createAccount("ACME", "Peter Planner", "pplanner@acme.com");
        
switchUser("pplanner@acme.com", new String[0]);

          <para>Unlike the very similar
          <classname>SwitchUserFixture</classname>, this fixture does not
          affect the currently logged on user while the fixtures are being
          installed. Instead, it is used to specify the user to logon as once
          all the fixtures have been installed.</para>

          <para>If more than one <classname>LogonFixture</classname> is
          specified, the last one encountered is used.</para>

          <title><classname>UserProfileFixture</classname></title>

          <para>The <classname>UserProfileFixture</classname> is used to
          populate the configured profile store<footnote>
              <para>A profile store is a persistence mechanism provided by the
              configured runtime that allows user profiles to be stored
              between runs. It is similar to, but independent of, an object
              store (which stores the domain objects themselves).</para>
            </footnote> with user profiles (the concept of which is described
          in <xref linkend="chp.UserProfiles" />).</para>

          <para>To create a user profile for a specific user, inherit from
          <classname>UserProfileFixture</classname>, use the inherited
          <methodname>newUserProfile()</methodname> to create a profile and
          use the inherited <methodname>saveForUser(...)</methodname> method
          to save that profile.</para>

          <para>It is also possible to create a 'template' perspective using
          the <methodname>saveAsDefault(...)</methodname> method. This is used
          as the basis for any new perspectives that are automatically
          created, eg for users who are logging in and for whom there is no
          perspective in existence.</para>

          <para>For example:</para>

          <programlisting>public class PerspectivesFixture extends UserProfileFixture {
  @Override
  protected void installProfiles() {
    Profile profile = newUserProfile();
    Perspective perspective = profile.newPerspective("ECS");
    perspective.addToServices(LocationFactory.class);
    perspective.addToServices(CustomerRepository.class);
    perspective.addToServices(PaymentMethodFactory.class);
        
    saveAsDefault(profile);
  }
}</programlisting>

          <para>With that set up, when a new user now logs in they will see
          three service icons on the screen for locations, customers and
          payment methods. In the <emphasis>dnd viewer</emphasis> the user
          will be able to add and remove services from their perspective. See
          the DnD Viewer documentation for further details.</para>

          <para>Any fixtures, if specified, are only ever loaded once; the
          fixture installer checks with
          <methodname>UserProfileSevice.isInitialized()</methodname> to see if
          the fixture is already installed. This allows fixtures to be used
          for seeding a persisting profile store, and then be ignored
          thereafter.</para>

      <title>XML Snapshots</title>

      <abstract>
        <para>Generating <acronym>XML</acronym> snapshots from domain
        objects.</para>
      </abstract>

      <para>The <emphasis>Apache Isis</emphasis> framework provides the
      capability to generate <acronym>XML</acronym> snapshots (and if required
      corresponding <acronym>XSD</acronym> schemas) based on graphs of domain
      objects. This is done using the
      <classname>org.apache.isis.core.runtime.snapshot.XmlSnapshot</classname>
      class.</para>

      <sect1>
        <title>Generating an XML Snapshot</title>

        <para>The <classname>XmlSnapshot</classname> can be created either
        directly or using a builder.</para>

        <sect2>
          <title>Basic Usage</title>

          <para>The standard usage is to instantiate directly.</para>

          <programlisting>XmlSnapshot snapshot = new XmlSnapshot(customer);
Element customerAsXml = snapshot.getXmlElement();</programlisting>

          <para>This will return the <classname>Customer</classname>'s fields,
          titles of simple references, number of items in collections.</para>

          <para>In order to use the <classname>XmlSnapshot</classname>, the
          domain object must implement
          <classname>org.apache.isis.applib.snapshot.Snapshottable</classname>.
          This is just a marker interface.</para>
        </sect2>

        <sect2>
          <title>Including other Elements</title>

          <para>It's also possible to instruct the
          <classname>XmlSnapshot</classname> to "walk" the object graph and
          include other information within the generated
          <acronym>XML</acronym>.</para>

          <para>For example:</para>

          <programlisting>XmlSnapshot snapshot = new XmlSnapshot(customer);
snapshot.include("placeOfBirth");   // (1)
snapshot.include("orders/product"); // (2)
Element customerAsXml = snapshot.getXmlElement();</programlisting>

          <para>In (1), we indicate that we want to also navigate to another
          domain object represented by simple reference "placeOfBirth"; in
          (2), we indicate that we want to navigate the "orders" collection
          (presumably of <classname>Order</classname>s) and for each
          referenced <classname>Order</classname>, to navigate in turn its
          "product" reference (presumably to a <classname>Product</classname>
          class).</para>

          <para>Note that <classname>XmlSnapshot</classname> is mutable, in
          that calls to its <methodname>getXmlElement()</methodname> may
          return different <acronym>XML</acronym> structures based on whether
          additional paths have been <methodname>include()</methodname>'d, or
          whether the state of the domain objects themselves have
          changed.</para>

      <sect1>
        <title>Using the Fluent API</title>

        <para>An <classname>XmlSnapshot</classname> can also be constructed
        using an alternative "fluent" API:</para>

        <programlisting>XmlSnapshot snapshot = 
     XmlSnapshot.create(customer)
                .includePath("placeOfBirth")
                .include("orders/product")
                .build();
Element customerAsXml = snapshot.getXmlElement();</programlisting>
      </sect1>

      <sect1>
        <title>The <classname>SnapshottableWithInclusions</classname>
        interface</title>

        <para>As already mentioned, in order to be snapshotted a domain object
        must implement the <classname>Snapshot</classname> interface. This is
        just a marker interface, so implementing it is trivial.</para>

        <para>Alternatively, the domain object can choose to implement the
        sub-interface, <classname>SnapshottableWithInclusions</classname>.
        This moves the responsibility for determining what is included within
        the snapshot from the caller to the snapshottable object
        itself:</para>

        <programlisting>public interface SnapshottableWithInclusions extends Snapshottable {
    List&lt;String&gt; snapshotInclusions();
}</programlisting>

        <para>If necessary, both approaches can be combined.</para>
      </sect1>

      <sect1>
        <title>Generating an XSD schema</title>

        <para>As well as obtaining the XML snapshot, it is also possible to
        obtain an XSD schema that the XML snapshot conforms to.</para>

        <programlisting>XmlSnapshot snapshot = ...;
Element customerAsXml = snapshot.getXmlElement();
Element customerXsd = snapshot.getXsdElement();</programlisting>

        <para>This can be useful for some tools. Note that for the
        <acronym>XSD</acronym> to be correct, the object being snapshotted
        must have non-null values for the paths that are
        <methodname>include()</methodname>'d. If this isn't done then the XSD
        will not be correct reflect for another snapshotted object that does
        have non-null values.</para>
      </sect1>

      <sect1>
        <title>Hints and Tips</title>

        <para>As an alternative to using include(), you might consider
        building a non-persisted domain object (a "view model") which can
        reference only the relevant information required for the
        snapshot.</para>

        <para>For example, if only the 5 most recent
        <classname>Order</classname>s for a <classname>Customer</classname>
        were required, a <classname>CustomerAndRecentOrders</classname> view
        model could hold a collection of just those 5
        <classname>Order</classname>s.</para>

        <para>Typically such view models would implement
        <classname>SnapshottableWithInclusions</classname>.</para>

    <appendix>
      <title>Recognized Annotations</title>

      <abstract>
        <para>All the annotations recognized in the <emphasis>Apache
        Isis</emphasis> default programming model.</para>
      </abstract>

      <para>This chapter defines the set of annotations that are recognised by
      the <emphasis>Apache Isis</emphasis> default programming model.</para>

      <sect1>
        <title>@ActionOrder</title>

        <note>
          <para>The recommended mechanism for specifying the order in which
          actions are listed to the user is <code>@MemberOrder</code> (see
          <xref linkend="sec.MemberOrderAnnotation" />)</para>
        </note>

        <para><code>@ActionOrder</code> provides a mechanism to specify the
        order in which actions appear in the user interface, in which the
        order is specified in one place in the class.</para>

        <para>For example:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific"><emphasis role="strong">@ActionOrder("PlaceNewOrder, CheckCredit")</emphasis>
public class Customer {

    public Order placeNewOrder() {}

    public CreditRating checkCredit() {}

...
}</programlisting>

        <para>The action names are not case sensitive.</para>

        <para>Compared to <classname>@MemberOrder</classname>, there is
        (currently) one additional advantage in that you can easily specify
        groupings (which may be rendered by the viewer as sub-menus). This
        information may be used by the viewing mechanism to render actions
        into sub-menus.</para>

        <para>For example:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">@ActionOrder("(Account Management: PlaceOrder, CheckCredit), (Personal Details: ChangeOfAddress, AddEmail)")
public class Customer {
    public CreditRating checkCredit() { ... }
    public void changeOfAddress() { ... }
    public Order placeNewOrder() { ... }
    public void addEmail(String emailAddress) { ... }
    ...
}</programlisting>

        <para>However, <code>@ActionOrder</code> is more 'brittle' to change:
        if you change the name of an existing action you will need to ensure
        that the corresponding name within the <code>@ActionOrder</code>
        annotation is also changed.</para>
      </sect1>

      <sect1>
        <title>@ActionSemantics</title>

        <para>This annotation, which applies only to actions, describes
        whether the invocation is safe (as no side-effects), is idempotent
        (may have side-effects but always has the same postconditions), or is
        neither safe nor idempotent. If the annotation is missing then the
        framework assumes non-idempotent.</para>

        <para>For example:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">public class Customer {
    @ActionSemantics(Of.SAFE)
    public CreditRating checkCredit() { ... }

    @ActionSemantics(Of.IDEMPOTENT)
    public void changeOfAddress(Address address) { ... }

    @ActionSemantics(Of.NON_IDEMPOTENT)
    public Order placeNewOrder() { ... }
    ...
}</programlisting>

        <para>The annotation was introduced for the restfulobjects viewer in
        order that action invocations could be made available using either
        <acronym>HTTP</acronym> <acronym>GET</acronym>, <acronym>PUT</acronym>
        or <acronym>POST</acronym> (respectively). It is now also used in core
        runtime's in-built concurrency checking; the invocation of a safe
        action does not perform a concurrency check, whereas non-safe actions
        do perform a concurrency check.</para>
      </sect1>

      <sect1>
        <title>@Aggregated</title>

        <para>This annotation indicates that the object is aggregated, or
        wholly owned, by a root object. This information is of use by some
        object stores implementations (to store the aggregated objects
        "inline"). At the time of writing none of the viewers exploit this
        information, though this may change in the future. (For example, the
        <acronym>DnD</acronym> viewer could be enhanced to prevent aggregated
        objects from being "dragged out" from their root object).</para>

        <para>All value types and all collections are automatically
        aggregated.</para>

        <warning>
          <para>Outside of value types and collections, the
          <classname>@Aggregated</classname> semantics are not completely
          well-defined and so its use is currently discouraged.</para>
        </warning>
      </sect1>

      <sect1>
        <title>@Bounded</title>

        <para>For immutable objects where there is a bounded set of instances,
        the <literal moreinfo="none">@Bounded</literal> annotation can be
        used.</para>

        <para>For example:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">@Bounded
public class County {
    ...
}</programlisting>

        <para>The number of instances is expected to be small enough that all
        instance can be held in memory. The viewer will use this information
        to render all the instances of this class in a drop-down list or
        equivalent.</para>

        <note>
          <para>Although this is not enforced, <literal
          moreinfo="none">@Bounded</literal> is intended for use on <literal
          moreinfo="none">final</literal> classes. Its behaviour when used on
          interfaces, or classes with sub-classes is not specified</para>
        </note>
      </sect1>

      <sect1>
        <title>@CommonlyUsed</title>

        <para>The <classname>@CommonlyUsed</classname> annotation indicates
        that a class member is likely to be used frequently by an end user and
        so should be presented in the viewer in an appropriate manner:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>an <classname>Order</classname>'s
            <methodname>lineItems</methodname> collection might initially be
            rendered expanded form so that the user could see a list of line
            items immediately when the order is rendered.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>a property of type <classname>Address</classname> might show
            the details of the referenced <classname>Address</classname> in a
            box</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>an action <methodname>submit()</methodname> might be
            rendered as a button rather than * buried inside a submenu
            somewhere.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>For example:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">public class Order {
    @CommonlyUsed
    public List&lt;LineItem&gt; getDetails() { ... }

    @CommonlyUsed
    public void submit() { ... }
    ...
}</programlisting>

        <para>For properties and collections there is some similarity between
        this concept and that of eager-loading as supported by some object
        stores. Indeed, some object stores may choose use their own specific
        annotations (eg a JDO default fetch group) in order to infer this
        semantic.</para>
      </sect1>

      <sect1 id="sec.DebugAnnotation">
        <title>@Debug</title>

        <para>The <classname>@Debug</classname> annotation marks an action
        method as available in debug mode only, and so will not normally be
        displayed by the user interface.</para>

        <para>For example:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">public class Customer {
    public Order placeNewOrder() { ... }
    @Debug
    public List&lt;Order&gt; listRecentOrders() { ... }
    ...
}</programlisting>

        <para>The exact means to access <classname>@Debug</classname> actions
        depends on the viewer.</para>
      </sect1>

      <sect1>
        <title>@Defaulted</title>

        <para>The concept of "defaulted" means being able to provide a default
        value for the type by way of the
        <classname>org.apache.isis.applib.adapters.DefaultsProvider</classname>
        interface. Generally this only applies to value types, where the
        <classname>@Value</classname> annotation (see <xref
        linkend="sec.ValueAnnotation" />) implies encodability through the
        <classname>ValueSemanticsProvider</classname> interface (see <xref
        linkend="chp.ValueTypes" />).</para>

        <para>For these reasons the <classname>@Defaulted</classname>
        annotation is generally never applied directly, but can be thought of
        as a placeholder for future enhancements whereby non-value types might
        also have a default value provided for them.</para>
      </sect1>

      <sect1>
        <title>@DescribedAs</title>

        <para>The <literal moreinfo="none">@DescribedAs</literal> annotation
        is used to provide a short description of something that features on
        the user interface. How this description is used will depend upon the
        viewing mechanism - but it may be thought of as being like a 'tool
        tip'.</para>

        <para>Descriptions may be provided for objects, members (properties,
        collections and actions), and for individual parameters within an
        action method. <literal moreinfo="none">@DescribedAs</literal>
        therefore works in a very similar manner to <literal
        moreinfo="none">@Named</literal> (see <xref
        linkend="sec.NamedAnnotation" />).</para>

        <sect2>
          <title>Providing a description for an object</title>

          <para>To provide a description for an object, use the <literal
          moreinfo="none">@DescribedAs</literal> annotation immediately before
          the declaration of that object class.</para>

          <para>For example:</para>

          <programlisting format="linespecific">@DescribedAs("A customer who may have originally become known to us via " +
             "the marketing system or who may have contacted us directly.")
public class ProspectiveSale {
   ...
}</programlisting>
        </sect2>

        <sect2>
          <title>Providing a description for an object member</title>

          <para>Any member (property, collection or action) may provide a
          description. To specify this description, use the <literal
          moreinfo="none">@DescribedAs</literal> annotation immediately before
          the declaration of that member.</para>

          <para>For example:</para>

          <programlisting format="linespecific">public class Customer {
    @DescribedAs("The name that the customer has indicated that they wish to be " +
                 "addressed as (e.g. Johnny rather than Jonathan)")
    public String getFirstName() { ... }
}</programlisting>
        </sect2>

        <sect2>
          <title>Providing a description for an action parameter</title>

          <para>To provide a description for an individual action parameter,
          use the <literal moreinfo="none">@DescribedAs</literal> annotation
          in-line i.e. immediately before the parameter declaration.</para>

          <para>For example:</para>

          <programlisting format="linespecific">public class Customer {
    public Order placeOrder(
                      Product product,
                      @Named("Quantity")
                      @DescribedAs("The quantity of the product being ordered")
                      int quantity) {
        Order order = createTransientInstance(Order.class);
        order.modifyCustomer(this);
        order.modifyProduct(product);
        order.setQuantity(quantity);        
        return order;
    }
    ...
}</programlisting>
        </sect2>
      </sect1>

      <sect1>
        <title>@Disabled</title>

        <para>The <literal moreinfo="none">@Disabled</literal> annotation
        means that the member cannot be used in any instance of the class.
        When applied to the property it means that the user may not modify the
        value of that property (though it may still be modified
        programmatically). When applied to an action method, it means that the
        user cannot invoke that method.</para>

        <para>For example:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">public class Customer {
    @Disabled
    public void assessCreditWorthiness() { ... }

    @Disabled
    public int getInitialCreditRating(){ ... }
    public void setInitialCreditRating(int initialCreditRating) { ... }
}</programlisting>

        <para>Note that if an action is marked as <literal
        moreinfo="none">@Disabled</literal>, it will be shown on the user
        interface but cannot ever be invoked. The only possible reason we can
        think to do this is during prototyping, to indicate an action that is
        still to be developed. If a method is intended for programmatic use,
        but not intended ever to be invoked directly by a user, then it should
        be marked as <literal moreinfo="none">@Hidden</literal>
        instead.</para>

        <para>This annotation can also take two parameter indicating where (in
        the UI) it is to be disabled, and when (in the object's lifecycle) it
        is to be disabled. For example:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">public class Customer {
    <emphasis role="strong">@Disabled</emphasis>(when=When.UNTIL_PERSISTED)
    public void assessCreditWorthiness() { ... }
}</programlisting>

        <para>would disable the action until the object has been saved.
        And:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">public class Customer {
    <emphasis role="strong">@Disabled</emphasis>(where=Where.PARENTED_TABLES)
    public void getFirstName() { ... }
}</programlisting>

        <para>would disable the property in parented tables but not in regular
        object forms (though note: this would only be used by viewers that
        provide in-table editing capability).</para>

        <para>The acceptable values for the <varname>where</varname> parameter
        are:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para><code>Where.ANYWHERE</code></para>

            <para>The member should be disabled everywhere.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para><code>Where.OBJECT_FORMS</code></para>

            <para>The member should be disabled when displayed within an
            object form. For most viewers, this applies to property and
            collection members, not actions.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para><code>Where.PARENTED_TABLES</code></para>

            <para>The member should be disabled when displayed as a column of
            a table within a parent object's collection. For most (all?)
            viewers, this will have meaning only if applied to a property
            member.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para><code>Where.STANDALONE_TABLES</code></para>

            <para>The member should be disabled when displayed as a column of
            a table showing a standalone list of objects, for example as
            returned by a repository query. For most (all?) viewers, this will
            have meaning only if applied to a property member.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para><code>Where.ALL_TABLES</code></para>

            <para>The member should be disabled when displayed as a column of
            a table, either an object's * collection or a standalone list.
            This combines PARENTED_TABLE} and STANDALONE_TABLE</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para><code>Where.NOWHERE</code></para>

            <para>Has no meaning for the <classname>@Disabled</classname>
            annotation (though is used by the <classname>@Hidden</classname>
            annotation, see <xref linkend="sec.HiddenAnnotation" />).</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>The acceptable values for the <varname>when</varname> parameter
        are:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para><code>When.ALWAYS</code></para>

            <para>The member should be disabled at all times.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para><code>When.NEVER</code></para>

            <para>The member should never be disabled (unless disabled through
            some other mechanism, for example an imperative
            <methodname>disableXxx()</methodname> supporting method).. </para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para><code>When.ONCE_PERSISTED</code></para>

            <para>The member should be enabled for transient objects, but

          <listitem>

            enabled for persisted objects.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>By default the annotated property or action is always disabled
        (ie defaults to <classname>Where.ANYWHERE</classname>,
        <classname>When.ALWAYS</classname>).</para>
      </sect1>

      <sect1>
        <title>@Encodable</title>

        <para>Encodability means the ability to convert an object to-and-from
        a string, by way of the
        <classname>org.apache.isis.applib.adapters.EncoderDecoder</classname>
        interface. Generally this only applies to value types, where the
        <classname>@Value</classname> annotation (see <xref

        <classname>ValueSemanticsProvider</classname> interface (see <xref
        linkend="chp.ValueTypes" />).</para>

        <para>For these reasons the <classname>@Encodable</classname>
        annotation is generally never applied directly, but can be thought of
        as a placeholder for future enhancements whereby non-value types might

        <title>@EqualByContent</title>

        <para>Equal-by-content is a characteristic of value types, and is
        implied by any class annotated with the the
        <classname>@Value</classname> annotation (see <xref
        linkend="sec.ValueAnnotation" /> and also <xref
        linkend="chp.ValueTypes" />).</para>

        <para>The <classname>@EqualByContent</classname> annotation exists so
        that this semantic could, if required, by applied directly to an
        object without it necessarily also being annotated as a value.</para>

        <para>That said, this annotation is only really for completeness.
        Moreover, the semantic captured by this annotation is currently used
        by the framework (not in any object store nor viewer).</para>

        <title>@Executed</title>

        <para>The <classname>@Executed</classname> annotation is relevant only
        for client/server deployments (eg with the DnD viewer).</para>

        <para>In a client/server deployment, all methods for persistent
        objects are executed on the server-side and for transient objects are
        executed on the client-side.</para>

        <para>This annotation can be used to override that default.</para>

          <title>Forcing a method to be executed on the client</title>

          <para>The <classname>@Executed(Where.LOCALLY)</classname> annotation
          marks an action method so that it executes on the client, rather
          than being forwarded to the server for execution. This is useful for
          methods that invoke a service that must be run client-side, for
          example spawning off a separate process (such as a web browser or
          Acrobat Reader).</para>

          <para>The <classname>@Executed(Where.REMOTELY)</classname>
          annotation marks an action method so that it executes on the server,
          even though it would normally be executed on the client (as methods
          for transient objects are). This is useful for methods that although
          based on transient objects need access to persistent objects.</para>

      <sect1 id="sec.ExplorationAnnotation">
        <title>@Exploration</title>

        <para>The <classname>@Exploration</classname> annotation marks an
        action method as available in exploration mode only, and therefore not
        intended for use in the production system. An exploration action may
        or may not also be a debug action (annotated with
        <classname>@Debug</classname>, see <xref
        linkend="sec.DebugAnnotation" />).</para>

        <para>For example:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">public class Customer {

        <title>@Facets</title>

        <para>The <classname>@Facets</classname> annotation specifies
        <classname>FacetFactory</classname> implementations and so can be used
        to run install arbitrary <classname>Facet</classname>s for a type.
        Generally this is not needed, but can be useful for overriding a
        custom programming model where a <classname>FacetFactory</classname>
        is not typically included.</para>

        <title>@FieldOrder</title>

        <note>
          <para>The recommended mechanism for specifying the order in which
          fields are listed to the user is <code>@MemberOrder</code> (see
          <xref linkend="sec.MemberOrderAnnotation" />)</para>
        </note>

        <para><code>@FieldOrder</code> provides a mechanism to specify the
        order in which fields appear in the user interface, in which the order
        is specified in one place in the class.</para>

        <para>For example:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">@FieldOrder("Name, Address, DateOfBirth, RecentOrders")
public class Customer {
    public Date getDateOfBirth() {...}
    public List&lt;Order&gt; getRecentOrders() {...}
    public String getAddress() {...}
    public String getName() {...}
    ...
}</programlisting>

        <para>The field names are not case sensitive.</para>

        <para>However, <code>@FieldOrder</code> is more 'brittle' to change:
        if you change the name of an existing property you will need to ensure
        that the corresponding name within the <code>@FieldOrder</code>
        annotation is also changed.</para>

      <sect1 id="sec.HiddenAnnotation">
        <title>@Hidden</title>

        <para>The <literal moreinfo="none">@Hidden</literal> annotation
        indicates that the member (property, collection or action) to which it
        is applied should never be visible to the user. It can also be applied
        to service types (it has no effect if applied to entities or
        values).</para>

        <para>For example:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">public class Customer {
    @Hidden
    public int getInternalId() { ... }

    @Hidden
    public void updateStatus() { ... }

        <para>Or, applied to a service:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">@Hidden
public class EmailService {
    public void sendEmail(...) { ... }
    ...
}</programlisting>

        <para>This annotation can also take a parameters indicating where and
        when it is to be hidden. For example:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">public class Customer {
    @Hidden(when=When.ONCE_PERSISTED)
    public int getInternalId() { ... }
    ...
}</programlisting>

        <para>would show the <varname>Id</varname> until the object has been

        <programlisting format="linespecific">public class Customer {
    @Hidden(where=Where.ALL_TABLES)
    public int getDateOfBirth() { ... }
    ...
}</programlisting>

        <para>would suppress the <varname>dateOfBirth</varname> property of a

        <title>@Immutable</title>

        <para>The <literal moreinfo="none">@Immutable</literal> annotation may
        be applied to a class, and indicates to the framework that the state

        reject any changes to the objects that might have occurred
        programmatically.</para>

        <para>For example:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">@Immutable
public class Country {

        <para>This annotation can also take a single parameter indicating when

        <programlisting format="linespecific">@Immutable(When.ONCE_PERSISTED)
public class Email {

      <sect1 id="sec.MaskAnnotation">
        <title>@Mask</title>

        <para>The <literal moreinfo="none">@Mask</literal> annotation may be
        applied to any property, or to any parameter within an action method,
        that allows the user to type in text as input. It can also annotate a
        string-based value type, and thereby apply to all properties or
        parameters of that type.</para>

        <para>The mask serves to validate, and potentially to normalise, the

        <title>@MemberOrder</title>

        <para><code>@MemberOrder</code> is the recommended mechanism for
        specifying the order in which fields and/or actions are presented to
        the user. (<code>@ActionOrder</code> and <code>@FieldOrder</code>
        provide alternative mechanisms).</para>

        <para><code>@MemberOrder</code> is specified at the individual member
        level, relative to other members, as a string. The simplest convention
        is to use numbers - 1, 2, 3 - though it is a better idea to leave gaps
        in the numbers - 10, 20, 30 perhaps - such that a new member may be
        added without having to edit existing numbers. A useful alternative is
        to adopt the 'dewey-decimal' notation - 1, 1.1, 1.2, 2, 3, 5.1.1,
        5.2.2, 5.2, 5.3 - which allows for an indefinite amount of future
        insertion, and allows subclasses to insert their class members as
        required.</para>

        <para>For example:</para>

        <programlisting>Public Class Customer {
    @MemberOrder(sequence="2.1")
    Public String getAddress() {...}
    Public void setAddress(value as String) {...}

    @MemberOrder(sequence="1.1")
    Public String getFirstName() {...}
    Public void setFirstName(value as String) {...}

    @MemberOrder(sequence="1.2")
    Public String getLastName() {...}
    Public void setLastName(value as String) {...}

    @MemberOrder(sequence="3")
    Public Date getDateOfBirth() {...}
    Public void setDateOfBirth(value as Date) {...}
    ...
}   </programlisting>

        <para>If a member does not have a specified order then it will be
        placed after those that are specified. Two members may have the same
        sequence specifier, but in such a case the relative ordering of those
        members will be indeterminate.</para>

        <note>
          <para>Certain styles of user interface may lay out an object's
          properties and its collections separately, in which case the
          relative member order of properties and collections will be
          evaluated separately. In general, though, consider the layout of all
          properties and collections together, and of all actions
          together.</para>

        provides information about the carriage returns in a <literal

        a string-based value type. It also implies a hint to the viewer that
        the widget to be used should be over multiple lines (eg a text area
        rather than a text field), with appropriate wrapping and/or
        scrollbars.</para>

        <para>More formally, the annotation indicates that:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>the <code>String</code> property or parameter may contain

          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>(optionally) that the text should be wrapped (the default is

        <warning>
          <para>Currently the <literal
          moreinfo="none">preventWrapping</literal> functionality is not fully
          implemented.</para>
        </warning>

        <para>The syntax is:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">public class BugReport {
    @MultiLine(numberOfLines=10)
    public String getStepsToReproduce() { ... }
    public void setStepsToReproduce(String stepsToReproduce) { ... }
    ...
}</programlisting>

        <para>Here the <literal moreinfo="none">stepsToReproduce</literal> may
        be displayed in a text area of 10 rows, with no wrapping. A horizontal
        scrollbar may appear if the number of characters on any given row
        exceeds the width.</para>

        <para>Another example:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">public class Email {
    @MultiLine(numberOfLines=20, preventWrapping=false)
    public String getBody() { ... }

}</programlisting>

        <para>Here the body should be displayed in a text area of 20 rows,
        with wrapping.</para>

        <para>If the annotation is combined with the <literal
        moreinfo="none">@TypicalLength</literal>, then the expected width of
        the text area in the user interface will be determined by the value of
        the typical length divided by the number of specified lines. For
        example:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">public class Email {
    @MultiLine(numberOfLines=20, preventWrapping=false)
    @TypicalLength(800)
    public String getBody() { ... }
    public void setBody(String body) { ... }
    ...
}</programlisting>

        <para>Here the body will (likely be) displayed in a text area of 20
        rows, with 40 columns.</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">public class Customer {
    @MustSatisfy(StartWithCapitalLetterSpecification.class)
    public String getFirstName() { ... }
    ...
}</programlisting>

        <para>Or, on an action parameter:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">public class CustomerRepository {
    public Customer newCustomer(
            @MustSatisfy(StartWithCapitalLetterSpecification.class)
            @Named("First Name") firstName
           ,@MustSatisfy(StartWithCapitalLetterSpecification.class)
            @Named("Last Name") lastName) {
        ...
    }
    ...
}</programlisting>

        <para>The <classname>Specification</classname> is consulted during
        validation, being passed the proposed value.</para>

        <para>An alternative to using <classname>@MustSatisfy</classname> is

      <sect1 id="sec.NamedAnnotation">
        <title>@Named</title>

        <para>The <literal moreinfo="none">@Named</literal> annotation is used
        when you want to specify the way something is named on the user
        interface i.e. when you do not want to use the name generated
        automatically by the system. It can be applied to objects, members
        (properties, collections, and actions) and to parameters within an
        action method.</para>

        <para><warning>
            <para>Generally speaking it is better to rename the property,
            collection or action. The only common case where
            <literal>@Named</literal> is common is to rename parameters for
            built-in value types. Even here though a custom value type can be
            defined using <classname>@Value</classname> so that the value type
            is used as the parameter name. <classname>@Named</classname> may
            also be used if the name needs punctuation or other symbols in the
            name presented to the user.</para>
          </warning></para>

        <sect2>
          <title>Specifying the name of an object</title>

          <para>By default the name of an object is derived, reflectively from
          the class name. To specify a different name for an object, use the
          <literal moreinfo="none">@Named</literal> annotation in front of the
          class declaration.</para>

          <para>For example:</para>

          <programlisting format="linespecific">@Named("Customer")
public class CustomerImpl implements Customer{
   ...
}</programlisting>

          <para>See also the <literal moreinfo="none">@Plural</literal>

        <sect2>
          <title>Specifying the name of a class member</title>

          <para>By default, the name of a class member (a property, collection
          or action) presented to the user is derived, reflectively, from the
          name of the member defined in the program code. To specify a
          different name use the <literal moreinfo="none">@Named
          </literal>annotation immediately before the member
          declaration.</para>

          <para>For example:</para>

          <programlisting format="linespecific">public class Customer {
    <emphasis role="strong">@Named("Given Name")</emphasis>
    public String getFirstName() { ... }

    <emphasis role="strong">@Named("Family Name")</emphasis>
    public String getSurname() { ... }

    public CreditRating getCreditRating() { ... }

          mechanism for internationalisation.</para>

        <sect2>
          <title>Specifying the name for an action parameter</title>

          <para>The most common usage of <literal
          moreinfo="none">@Named</literal> is be to specify names for the
          parameters of an action. This is because the parameter name declared
          in the code for the action method cannot be picked up reflectively
          (by default, the user interface will use the type of the parameter
          as the name; for a String or a Boolean, this is almost certainly not
          what is required).</para>

          <para>To specify the name of a parameter, the <literal
          moreinfo="none">@Named</literal> annotation is applied 'in-line'
          (i.e. preceding the individual parameter declaration.</para>

          <para>For example:</para>

          <programlisting format="linespecific">public class Customer {
    public Order placeOrder(
            Product product
           ,@Named("Quantity")
            int quantity) {
        Order order = newTransientInstance(Order.class);
        order.modifyCustomer(this);
        order.modifyProduct(product);
        order.setQuantity(quantity);        
        return order;
    }
    ...
}</programlisting>

      <sect1 id="sec.NotContributedAnnotation">
        <title>@NotContributed</title>

        <para>The <classname>@NotContributed</classname> annotation applies
        only to action methods, and specifically to the actions of services.
        If present, it indicates that the action should not be contributed to
        any of its domain object arguments.</para>

        <para>For example:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">public class OrderServices {

        <para>If the action should neither be contributed nor appear in the

      <sect1 id="sec.NotInServiceMenuAnnotation">

        <para>The <classname>@NotInServiceMenu</classname> annotation applies
        only to action methods, and specifically to the actions of services.
        If present, it indicates that the action should not appear in the

        any of its domain object arguments.</para>

        <para>For example:</para>

      <sect1 id="not-persistable">
        <title>@NotPersistable</title>

        <para>The <classname>@NotPersistable</classname> annotation indicates
        that transient instances of this class may be created but may not be
        persisted. The framework will not provide the user with an option to
        'save' the object, and attempting to persist such an object
        programmatically would be an error.</para>

        <para>For example:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific"><classname>@NotPersistable</classname>
public class InputForm {
    // members and actions here
}</programlisting>

        <para>This annotation can also take a single parameter indicating
        whether it is only the user that cannot persist the object, for
        example the following code would prevent the user from saving the
        object (via the viewer) but still allow the program to persist the
        object.</para>

        <para>For example:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">@NotPersistable(By.USER)
public class InputForm {
    ...
}</programlisting>

        <para>The acceptable values for the parameter are:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para><code>By.USER</code></para>
          </listitem>

            <para><code>By.USER_OR_PROGRAM</code></para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>By default the annotated object is effectively transient (ie

      </sect1>

      <sect1>
        <title>@NotPersisted</title>

        <para>The <classname>@NotPersisted</classname> annotation indicates
        that the property is not to be persisted.</para>

        <note>
          <para>In many cases the same thing can be achieved simply by
          providing the property with a 'getter' but no 'setter'.</para>
        </note>

        <para>For example:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">public class Order {

      </sect1>

      <sect1>
        <title>@ObjectType</title>

        <para>The <classname>@ObjectType</classname> annotation is used to
        provide a unique abbreviation for the object's class name. This is
        used internally to generate a string representation of an objects
        identity (the Oid).</para>

        <para>For example:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">@ObjectType("ORD")
public class Order {

    ...
}</programlisting>

        <para>If no <code>@ObjectType</code> annotation is present, then the
        framework uses the fully-qualified class name.</para>

        <para>If an <code>@ObjectType</code> is not unique, then the framework
        will fail to boot.</para>
      </sect1>

      <sect1>
        <title>@Optional</title>

        <para>By default, the system assumes that all properties of an object
        are required, and therefore will not let the user save a new object
        unless a value has been specified for each property. Similarly, by
        default, the system assumes that all parameters in an action are
        required and will not let the user execute that action unless values
        have been specified for each parameter.</para>

        <para>To indicate that either a property, or an action parameter, is
        optional, use the <literal moreinfo="none">@Optional</literal>
        annotation.</para>

        <note>
          <para>The <literal moreinfo="none">@Optional</literal>annotation has
          no meaning for a primitive property (or parameter) such as <literal
          moreinfo="none">int</literal> - because primitives will always
          return a default value (e.g. zero). If optionality is required, then
          use the corresponding wrapper class (e.g. java.lang.Integer).</para>
        </note>

        <sect2>
          <title>Making a property optional</title>

          <para>Annotate the getter to indicate that a property is

    public java.util.Date getShipDate() { ... }
    public void setShipDate(Date java.util.shipDate) { ... }

    @Optional
    public String getComments() { ... }
    public void setComments(String comments) { ... }
}</programlisting>

          <para>Here the <literal moreinfo="none">product</literal> and
          <literal moreinfo="none">shipDate</literal> properties are both
          required, but the <literal moreinfo="none">comments</literal>
          property is optional.</para>
        </sect2>

        <sect2>
          <title>Making an action parameter optional</title>

          <para>To indicate that an action may be invoked without having to
          specify a value for a particular parameter, annotate with
          <literal>@Optional</literal>. For example:</para>

          <programlisting format="linespecific">public class Customer {
    public Order placeOrder(
            Product product
           ,@Named("Quantity") int quantity

      <sect1>
        <title>@Paged</title>

        <para>This annotation is used to indicate that parented and/or
        standalone collections should be paginated.</para>

        <para>When annotated on a collection, <classname>@Paged</classname>
        indicates the page size of a parented collection. When annotated on a
        type, <classname>@Paged</classname> indicates the page size of a
        standalone collection.</para>

        <para>For example:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">@Paged(30)
public class Order {

    @Paged(15)
    public List&lt;LineItem&gt; getDetails() {...}
}</programlisting>

        <para>This indicates a page size of 15 for parented collections, and a page size of 30 for
          standalone collections.</para>
        <para>When omitting a parameter value or omitting the annotation completely, the
          configured defaults in <filename>isis.properties</filename> wil be used.</para>
        <para>For example:</para>
        <para>
          <programlisting>isis.viewers.paged.standalone=20
isis.viewers.paged.parented=5</programlisting>
        </para>
        <para>This indicates a page size of 5 for parented collections and a page size of 20 for
          standalone collections.</para>
      </sect1>

      <sect1>
        <title>@Parseable</title>

        <para>Parseability means being able to parse a string representation
        into an object by way of the
        <classname>org.apache.isis.applib.adapters.Parser</classname>
        interface. Generally this only applies to value types, where the
        <classname>@Value</classname> annotation (see <xref
        linkend="sec.ValueAnnotation" />) implies encodability through the
        <classname>ValueSemanticsProvider</classname> interface (see <xref
        linkend="chp.ValueTypes" />).</para>

        <para>For these reasons the <classname>@Parser</classname> annotation
        is generally never applied directly, but can be thought of as a
        placeholder for future enhancements whereby non-value types might also
        have be able to be parsed. For example, a
        <classname>Customer</classname> could in theory be parsed from a
        string representing that <classname>Customer</classname>'s title
        (perhaps in conjunction with some other annotation to determine the
        repository by which to perform the lookup).</para>
      </sect1>

      <sect1 id="sec.PluralAnnotation">
        <title>@Plural</title>

        <para>When the framework displays a collection of several objects it
        may use the plural form of the object type in the title. By default
        the plural name will be created by adding an 's' to the end of the
        singular name (whether that is the class name or another name
        specified using <literal moreinfo="none">@Named</literal>). Where the
        single name ends in 'y' then the default plural name will end in 'ies'
        - for example a collection of <literal
        moreinfo="none">Country</literal> objects will be titled 'Countries'.
        Where these conventions do not work, the programmer may specify the
        plural form of the name using <classname>@Plural</classname>. For
        example:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific"><emphasis role="strong">@Plural("Children")</emphasis>
public class Child {
    // members and actions here
}</programlisting>
      </sect1>

      <sect1>
        <title>@Programmatic</title>

        <para>The <classname>@Programmatic</classname> annotation can be used
        to cause Apache Isis to complete ignore a class member. This means it
        won't appear in any viewer, its value will not be persisted, and it
        won't appear in any XML snapshots (see <xref
        linkend="chp.XmlSnapshots" />).</para>

        <para>A common use-case is to ignore implementation-level artifacts.
        For example:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">public class Customer implements Comparable&lt;Customer&gt; {
    ...
    @Programmatic
    public int compareTo(Customer c) { 
        return getSalary() - c.getSalary();
    }
    ...
}</programlisting>

        <para>Note that <methodname>@Programmatic</methodname> does not simply
        imply <methodname>@Hidden</methodname> and
        <methodname>@NotPersisted</methodname>; it actually means that the
        class member will not be part of the Isis metamodel.</para>
      </sect1>

      <sect1 id="sec.PrototypeAnnotation">
        <title>@Prototype</title>

        <para>The <classname>@Prototype</classname> annotation marks an action
        method as available in prototype mode only, and therefore not intended
        for use in the production system. A prototype action may or may not
        also be a debug action (annotated with <classname>@Debug</classname>,
        see <xref linkend="sec.DebugAnnotation" />).</para>

        <para>For example:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">public class Customer {
    public Order placeNewOrder() { ... }
    @Prototype
    public List&lt;Order&gt; listRecentOrders() { ... }

      <sect1 id="sec.RegExAnnotation">
        <title>@RegEx</title>

        <para>The <literal moreinfo="none">@RegEx</literal> annotation may be
        applied to any string property, or to any parameter within an action
        method. It can also be applied to any string-based value type. It
        serves both to validate and potentially to normalise the format of the
        input. <literal moreinfo="none">@Regex</literal> is therefore similar
        in use to <literal moreinfo="none">@Mask</literal> (see <xref
        linkend="sec.MaskAnnotation" />) but provides more flexibility.</para>

        <para>The syntax is:</para>

        <para><literal moreinfo="none">@RegEx(validation = "regEx string",
        format = "regEx string", caseSensitive =
        &lt;true|false&gt;)</literal></para>

        <para>Only the first parameter is required; the format defaults to "no
        formatting", and caseSensitive defaults to false.</para>

        <para>For example, on a property:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">public class Customer {
    @RegEx(validation = "(\\w+\\.)*\\w+@(\\w+\\.)+[A-Za-z]+")
    public String getEmail() {}

        <para>Or, on a parameter:</para>

            @Named("Email") String email) {
        ...

        <para>Or, on a value type:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">@Value(...)
@RegEx(validation = "(\\w+\\.)*\\w+@(\\w+\\.)+[A-Za-z]+")
public class EmailAddress {
   ...
y}</programlisting>
      </sect1>

      <sect1 id="sec.TitleAnnotation">
        <title>@Title</title>

        <para>The <literal moreinfo="none">@Title</literal> annotation is used
        to indicate which property or properties make up the object title. If
        more than one property is used, the order can be specified (using the
        same Dewey-decimal notation as used by
        <classname>@MemberOrder</classname>) and the string to use between the
        components can also be specified.</para>

        <para>For example:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">public void Customer {
    @Title(sequence="1.0")
    public String lastName() { ... }
    ...
    @Title(sequence="1.5", prepend=", ")
    public String firstName() { ... }
    ...
    @Title(sequence="1.7", append=".")
    public String midInitial() { ... }
    ...
}</programlisting>

        <para>could be used to create names of the style "Bloggs, Joe
        K."</para>

        <para>It is also possible to annotate reference properties; in this
        case the title will return the title of the referenced object (rather
        than, say, its string representation).</para>

        <para>An additional convention for <classname>@Title</classname>
        properties is that they are hidden in tables (in other words, it
        implies <code>@Hidden(where=Where.ALL_TABLES)</code>. For viewers that
        support this annotation (for example, the Wicket viewer), this
        convention excludes any properties whose value is already present in
        the title column. This convention can be overridden using
        <code>@Hidden(where=Where.NOWHERE)</code>.</para>
      </sect1>

      <sect1>
        <title>@TypeOf</title>

        <para>The <literal moreinfo="none">@TypeOf</literal> annotation is
        used to specify the type of elements in a collection, when for
        whatever reason it is not possible to use generics.</para>

        <note>
          <para>Given that Apache Isis only supports Java 1.6 and later, it's
          not that obvious what such a reason might be...</para>
        </note>

        <para>For example:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">public void AccountService {

        <title>@TypicalLength</title>

        <para>The <literal moreinfo="none">@TypicalLength</literal> annotation
        indicates the typical length of a <literal
        moreinfo="none">String</literal> property or <literal
        moreinfo="none">String</literal> parameter in an action. It can also
        be specified for string-based value types.</para>

        <para>The information is generally used by the viewing mechanism to
        determine the space that should be given to that property or parameter
        in the appropriate view. If the typical length is the same as the
        <literal moreinfo="none">@MaxLength</literal> (see <xref
        linkend="sec.MaxLengthAnnotation" />) then there is no need to specify
        <literal moreinfo="none">@TypicalLength</literal> as well. If the
        value specified is zero or negative then it will be ignored.</para>

        <para>For example, for a property:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">public class Customer {
    @MaxLength(30)
    @TypicalLength(20)
    public String getFirstName() { ... }
    public void setFirstName(String firstName) { ... }
}</programlisting>

        <para>Or, for a parameter:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">public class CustomerRepository {
    public Customer newCustomer(
            @TypicalLength(20)
            @Named("First Name") String firstName
           ,@TypicalLength(20)
            @Named("Last Name") String lastName) {
        ...
    }
    ...
}</programlisting>

        <para>Or, for value type:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">@Value(...)
@TypicalLength(20)
public class FirstName {
    ...
}</programlisting>
      </sect1>

      <sect1 id="sec.ValueAnnotation">
        <title>@Value</title>

        <para>The <literal moreinfo="none">@Value</literal> annotation
        indicates that a class should be treated as a value type rather than
        as a reference (or entity) type. It does this providing an
        implementation of a
        <classname>org.apache.isis.applib.adapters.ValueSemanticsProvider</classname>.</para>

        <para>For example:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">@Value(semanticsProviderClass=ComplexNumberValueSemanticsProvider.class)
public class ComplexNumber {
    ...
}</programlisting>

        <para>The <classname>ValueSemanticsProvider</classname> allows the
        framework to interact with the value, parsing strings and displaying
        as text, and encoding/decoding (for serialization). For more
        information, see <xref linkend="chp.ValueTypes" />.</para>
      </sect1>

      <sect1>
        <title>@ViewModel</title>

        <para>The <classname>@ViewModel</classname> annotation allows the
        developer to declare that a domain object is intended to be used as a
        view model. As such, any changes to its structure are guaranteed to be
        backwardly compatible.</para>

        <para>The annotation was originally introduced to support a
        requirement of the RestfulObjects viewer which directly expose the
        domain objects as RESTful representations</para>

        <para>For example, a domain object that represents a summary of a
        <classname>Customer</classname> and their most recent
        <classname>Order</classname>s might be annotated as:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">@NotPersistable
