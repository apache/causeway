    <title>Dynamic fixture service</title>

    <para>When developing applications it is nice to ready prepared objects so
    you don't have to continually create them every time you run in
    exploration mode. As you read already these can be created using fixtures,
    but that requires coding specific classes. Whilst turing on persistence
    means that you get back what you had last time, but that probably includes
    objects that you didn't want to keep. A better solution is to use the new
    fixture service that allows you to save specific objects on the desktop
    and have them, and only them, recreated when you next start up.</para>

      <title>Configuration</title>

      <para>Add the following property to
      <filename>isis.properties</filename> to enable this feature.
      Better still create and add it to a file called
      <filename>exploration.properties</filename> so it is only used in
      exploration mode.</para>

      <literallayout>isis.exploration-objects=true</literallayout>

      <para>There is a second property that allows you specify where your data
      file is stored.</para>

      <literallayout>isis.exploration-objects.file=tmp/data</literallayout>
