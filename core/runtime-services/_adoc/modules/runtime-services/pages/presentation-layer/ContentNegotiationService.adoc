The `ContentNegotiationService` is a plug-in point for the xref:vro:ROOT:about.adoc[RestfulObjects viewer] so that it can generate representations according to HTTP `Accept` header of the request.  This idea is discussed in section 34.1 of the link:http://restfulobjects.org[Restful Objects spec] v1.0.

The principal motivation is to allow more flexible representations to be generated for REST clients that (perhaps through their use of a certain Javascript library, say) expect, or at least works best with, a certain style of representation.

Another use case is to support "third party" REST clients over which you have no control.  In this scenario you _must not_ naively expose entities through the RO viewer, because over time those entities will inevitably evolve and change their structure.  If the entities were exposed directly then those REST clients will break.

Instead you need to create some sort of stable facade over your domain entities, one which you will preserve even if the domain entities change.  There are three ways in which you can do this:

* first is to solve the problem at the domain layer by defining a regular Apache Isis xref:userguide:fun:building-blocks.adoc#view-models[view model].  This is then surfaced over the RO viewer.  +
+
If the underlying entities change, then care must be taken to ensure that structure of the view model nevertheless is unchanged.

* a second option is to solve the problem at the persistence layer, but defining a (SQL) view in the database and then xref:odn:ROOT:jdo-mappings/mapping-to-a-view.adoc[mapping this] to a (read-only) entity.  Again this is surfaced by the RO viewer.  +
+
If the underlying tables change (as the result of a change in their corresponding domain entities) then once more the view must be refactored so that it still presents the same structure.

* our third option is to solve the problem at the presentation layer, using the `ContentNegotiationService` described in this section. +
+
The `ContentNegotiationService` is responsible for inspecting the HTTP `Accept` header, and use this to select the correct representation to render.  +
+
The Apache Isis framework provides three implementations of `ContentNegotiationService` which inspects different elements of the HTTP `Accept` header.  One of these implementations, `ContentNegotiationServiceXRoDomainType` will further delegate down to the companion xref:refguide:applib-svc:presentation-layer-spi/ContentMappingService.adoc[`ContentMappingService`] service (if configured/available), based on the value of the "x-ro-domain-type" parameter of the header. +
+
A typical implementation of `ContentMappingService` will convert the domain object into some sort of DTO (data transfer object) as specified by the "x-ro-domaintype".  If this DTO is annotated with JAXB or Jackson mappings, then the RO viewer (courtesy of the underlying link:http://resteasy.jboss.org/[RestEasy] framework) can serialize these directly. +
+
What all that means is that, if the underlying entities change, we are required to update the mappings in the `ContentMappingService` to map to the same DTOs.

This diagram illustrates the three options available:

== SPI

The SPI defined by this service is:

[source,java]
----
public interface ContentNegotiationService {
    Response.ResponseBuilder buildResponse(                     // <1>
            RepresentationService.Context2 renderContext2,
            ObjectAdapter objectAdapter);
    Response.ResponseBuilder buildResponse(                     // <2>
            RepresentationService.Context2 renderContext2,
            ObjectAndProperty objectAndProperty);
    Response.ResponseBuilder buildResponse(                     // <3>
            RepresentationService.Context2 renderContext2,
            ObjectAndCollection objectAndCollection);
    Response.ResponseBuilder buildResponse(                     // <4>
            RepresentationService.Context2 renderContext2,
            ObjectAndAction objectAndAction);
    Response.ResponseBuilder buildResponse(                     // <5>
            RepresentationService.Context2 renderContext2,
            ObjectAndActionInvocation objectAndActionInvocation);
}
----
<1> representation of a single object, as per section 14.4 of the RO spec, v1.0
<2> representation of a single property of an object, as per section 16.4 of the RO spec v1.0
<3> representation of a single collection of an object, as per section 17.5 of the RO spec v1.0
<4> representation of a single action (prompt) of an object, as per section 18.2 of the RO spec v1.0
<5> representation of the results of a single action invocation, as per section 19.5 of the RO spec v1.0

These methods provide:

* a `RepresentationService.Context2` which provides access to request-specific context (eg HTTP headers), session-specific context (eg authentication) and global context (eg configuration settings)

* an object representing the information to be rendered +
+
eg `ObjectAdapter`, `ObjectAndProperty`, `ObjectAndCollection` etc

In all cases, returning `null` will result in the regular RO spec representation being returned.





== Implementation

`ContentNegotiationServiceAbstract` (in `o.a.i.v.ro.rendering.service.conneg`) provides a no-op implementation of the SPI, along with supporting methods:

[source,java]
----
public abstract class ContentNegotiationServiceAbstract implements ContentNegotiationService {
    ...
    protected Object objectOf(final ObjectAdapter objectAdapter) { /* ... */ }
    protected Object returnedObjectOf(ObjectAndActionInvocation objectAndActionInvocation) { /* ... */ }

    protected Class<?> loadClass(String cls) { /* ... */ }

    protected void ensureJaxbAnnotated(Class<?> domainType) { /* ... */ }
    protected void ensureDomainObjectAssignable(
        String xRoDomainType, Class<?> domainType, Object domainObject) { /* ... */ }
}
----

As discussed in the introduction, the framework also provides three implementation of this service, one of which is `o.a.i.v.ro.rendering.service.conneg.ContentNegotiationServiceXRoDomainType`.   This implementation handles content negotiation for two of the possible representations, object representations and for action result representations:

* For object representations it will handle requests with HTTP `Accept` headers of the form:
** `application/json;profile=urn:org.restfulobjects:repr-types/object;x-ro-domain-type=...`
** `application/xml;profile=urn:org.restfulobjects:repr-types/object;x-ro-domain-type=...`

* for action result representations it will similarly handle requests with HTTP `Accept` headers of the form:
** `application/json;profile=urn:org.restfulobjects:repr-types/action-result;x-ro-domain-type=...` +
** `application/xml;profile=urn:org.restfulobjects:repr-types/action-result;x-ro-domain-type=...`


The value of the `x-ro-domain-type` parameter corresponds to the DTO to be mapped into by the xref:refguide:applib-svc:presentation-layer-spi/ContentMappingService.adoc[`ContentMappingService`].

If the DTO is annotated with JAXB, then also note that the runtime type must be annotated with the JAXB `javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlRootElement` so that RestEasy is able to unambiguously serialize it.

The other two implementations of `ContentNegotiationService` are:

* `ContentNegotiationServiceForRestfulObjectsV1_0` +
+
which returns representations according to the link:http://restfulobjects.org[Restful Objects] spec.
+
One extension (specific to Apache Isis, not part of the RO spec) is that actions can also be invoked with an HTTP `Accept` header of the form:
+
`application/json;profile=urn:org.restfulobjects:repr-types/object`
+
If the action result returns a collection then this will automatically converted to a `DomainObjectList` view model.
This can be useful for generic viewers.


* `ContentNegotiationServiceOrgApacheIsisV1` +
+
which returns xref:vro:ROOT:simplified-representations.adoc[simplified representations]



== Usage

You can find an example of all these services in the (non-ASF) http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-app-todoapp[Isis addons' todoapp].  This defines a `ToDoItemDto` class that is JAXB annotated (it is in fact generated from an XSD).

The example app also includes an implementation of `ContentMappingService` that maps `todoapp.dom.module.todoitem.ToDoItem` entities to `todoapp.dto.module.todoitem.ToDoItemDto` classes.

A REST client can therefore request a DTO representation of an entity by invoking

[source]
----
http://localhost:8080/restful/objects/TODO/0
----

with an `Accept` header of:

[source]
----
application/xml;profile=urn:org.restfulobjects:repr-types/object;x-ro-domain-type=todoapp.dto.module.todoitem.ToDoItemDto
----

will result in an XML serialization of that class:

image::ContentNegotiationService/accept-xml.png[width="700px",link="{imagesdir}/ContentNegotiationService/accept-xml.png"]


while similarly hitting the same URL with an `Accept` header of:

[source]
----
application/json;profile=urn:org.restfulobjects:repr-types/object;x-ro-domain-type=todoapp.dto.module.todoitem.ToDoItemDto
----

will result in the JSON serialization of that class:

image::ContentNegotiationService/accept-json.png[width="700px",link="{imagesdir}/ContentNegotiationService/accept-json.png"]




== Configuration

The default `ContentNegotiationServiceXRoDomainType` implementation provides a xref:refguide:config:configuring-core.adoc[configuration property] which controls whether a mapped domain object is pretty-printed (formatted, indented) or not:

[source,ini]
----
isis.services.ContentNegotiationServiceXRoDomainType.prettyPrint=true
----

If the property is not set, then the default depends on the xref:refguide:config:deployment-types.adoc[deployment type]; production mode will disable pretty printing, while prototyping mode will enable it.





== Registering the Services

Apache Isis' default implementations of `ContentNegotiationService` service are automatically registered and injected (it is annotated with `@DomainService`) so no further configuration is required.

To use an alternative implementation, use xref:refguide:applib-ant:DomainServiceLayout.adoc#menuOrder[`@DomainServiceLayout#menuOrder()`] (as explained in the xref:refguide:applib-svc:intro/overriding-the-services.adoc[introduction] to this guide).



== Related Services

The default implementation of `ContentNegotiationService` delegates to xref:refguide:applib-svc:presentation-layer-spi/ContentMappingService.adoc[`ContentMappingService`] (if present) to convert domain entities into a stable form (eg DTO).

The `ContentNegotiationService` is itself called by the (default implementation of) xref:core:runtime-services:presentation-layer/RepresentationService.adoc[`RepresentationService`].
