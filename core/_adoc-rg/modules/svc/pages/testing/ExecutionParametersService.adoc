The `ExecutionParametersService` is used by the framework simply to instantiate the `ExecutionParameters` object.
The `ExecutionParameters` object in turn is responsible for parsing the string parameter passed when executing fixtures through the UI to the xref:rg:svc:testing/FixtureScripts.adoc[`FixtureScripts`] domain service.
