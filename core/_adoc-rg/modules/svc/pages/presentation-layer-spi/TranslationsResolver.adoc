The `TranslationsResolver` service is one of the services that work together to implement Apache Isis' support for i18n, being used by Isis' default implementation of xref:rg:svc:presentation-layer-spi/TranslationService.adoc[`TranslationService`].

The role of the service itself is locate and return translations.


[NOTE]
====
For the "big picture" and further details on Apache Isis' i18n support, see xref:ug:btb:i18n.adoc[here].

== SPI

The SPI defined by this service is:

[source,java]
----
public interface TranslationsResolver {
    @Programmatic
    List<String> readLines(final String file);
}
----


== Implementation

Isis' xref:vw:ROOT:about.adoc[Wicket viewer] provides an implementation of this service (`TranslationsResolverWicket`) which leverages Apache Wicket APIs.  This searches for translation files in the standard `WEB-INF/` directory.

[NOTE]
====
Currently there is no equivalent implementation for the xref:vro:ROOT:about.adoc[RestfulObjects viewer].

== Related Services


This service works in conjunction with xref:rg:svc:presentation-layer-spi/LocaleProvider.adoc[`LocaleProvider`] and xref:rg:svc:presentation-layer-spi/TranslationService.adoc[`TranslationService`] in order to provide i18n support.
