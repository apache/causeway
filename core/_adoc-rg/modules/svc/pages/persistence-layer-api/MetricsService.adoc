The `MetricsService` is a request-scoped domain service that hooks into the JDO/DataNucleus ObjectStore to provide a number of counters relating to numbers of object loaded, dirtied etc.

The service is used by the xref:rg:svc:application-layer-api/InteractionContext.adoc[`InteractionContext`] domain service (to populate the DTO held by the `Interaction.Execution`) and also by the (internal) xref:fis:ROOT:persistence-layer/PublishingServiceInternal.adoc[`PublishingServiceInternal`] domain service (to populate the `PublishedObjects` class.


== API & Implementation

The API of the service is:

[source,java]
----
@RequestScoped
public interface MetricsService {
    int numberObjectsLoaded();              // <1>
    int numberObjectsDirtied();             // <2>
    int numberObjectPropertiesModified();   // <3>
}
----
<1> The number of objects that have, so far in this request, been loaded from the database.
Corresponds to the number of times that `javax.jdo.listener.LoadLifecycleListener#postLoad(InstanceLifecycleEvent)` is fired.
<2> The number of objects that have, so far in this request, been dirtied/will need updating in the database); a good measure of the footprint of the interaction.
Corresponds to the number of times that `javax.jdo.listener.DirtyLifecycleListener#preDirty(InstanceLifecycleEvent)` callback is fired.
<3> The number of individual properties of objects that were modified; a good measure of the amount of work being done in the interaction.
Corresponds to the number of times that the xref:rg:svc:persistence-layer-spi/AuditerService.adoc[`AuditerService`]'s `audit(...)` method will be called as the transaction completes.

The framework provides a default implementation of this API, namely `o.a.i.c.r.s.metrics.MetricsServiceDefault`.

The xref:rg:svc:persistence-layer-spi/PublisherService.adoc[`PublisherService`] also captures the metrics gathered by the `MetricsService` and publishes them as part of the `PublishedObjects` class (part of its SPI).
