The `mixinMethod()` attribute specifies the name of the method to be treated as a "reserved" method name, meaning that the mixin's name should instead be inferred from the mixin's type.

For example:

[source,java]
----
@DomainObject
public class Customer {

    @DomainObject(nature=Nature.MIXIN, mixinMethod="execute")
    public static class placeOrder {

        Customer customer;
        public placeOrder(Customer customer) { this.customer = customer; }

        public Customer execute(Product p, int quantity) { /* ... */ }
        public String disableExecute() { /* ... */ }
        public String validate0Execute() { /* ... */ }
    }
    ...
)
----

This allows all mixins to follow a similar convention, with the name of the mixin inferred entirely from its type ("placeOrder").

When invoked programmatically, the code reads:

[source,java]
----
mixin(Customer.placeOrder.class, someCustomer).execute(someProduct, 3);
----
