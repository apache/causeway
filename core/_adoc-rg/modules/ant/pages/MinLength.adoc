The `@MinLength` annotation is used to specify the minimum number of characters in a search of an xref:rg:cms:methods/prefixes.adoc#autoComplete[`autoComplete...()`] supporting method.


For example:

[source,java]
----
public ToDoItem add(
    final ToDoItem toDoItem) {
    getDependencies().add(toDoItem);
    return this;
}
public List<ToDoItem> autoComplete0Add(
        final @MinLength(2)
        String search) {
    final List<ToDoItem> list = toDoItems.autoComplete(search);
    list.removeAll(getDependencies());
    list.remove(this);
    return list;
}
