The `named()` attribute explicitly specifies the domain service's name, overriding the name that would normally be inferred from the Java source code.



[TIP]
====
The value of this attribute also has an important role to play in the positioning of the domain service's actions relative to the actions of other domain services.
See xref:rg:ant:DomainServiceLayout/menuOrder.adoc[`menuOrder()`] for a full discussion with examples.
====

For example:

[source,java]
----
@DomainService
@DomainServiceLayout(
    named="Customers"
)
public class CustomerRepository {
   ...
}
----
