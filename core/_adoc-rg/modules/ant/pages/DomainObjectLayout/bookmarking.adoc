The `bookmarking()` attribute indicates that an entity is automatically bookmarked.
This attribute is also supported for  xref:rg:ant:Action.adoc#bookmarking[domain objects].

(In the Wicket viewer), a link to a bookmarked object is shown in the bookmarks panel:

image::reference-annotations/DomainObjectLayout/bookmarking.png[width="720px",link="{imagesdir}/reference-annotations/DomainObjectLayout/bookmarking.png"]

[NOTE]
====
Note that this screenshot shows an earlier version of the xref:vw:ROOT:about.adoc[Wicket viewer] UI (specifically, pre 1.8.0).

For example:

[source,java]
----
@DomainObject(bookmarking=BookmarkPolicy.AS_ROOT)
public class ToDoItem ... {
    ...
}
----

indicates that the `ToDoItem` class is bookmarkable:


It is also possible to nest bookmarkable entities.
For example, this screenshot is taken from http://github.com/estatio/estatio[Estatio]:

For example, the `Property` entity "[OXF] Oxford Super Mall" is a root bookmark, but the `Unit` child entity "[OXF-001] Unit 1" only appears as a bookmark _but only if_ its parent `Property` has already been bookmarked.

This is accomplished with the following annotations:

[source,java]
----
@DomainObject(bookmarking=BookmarkPolicy.AS_ROOT)
public class Property { /* ... */ }
----

and

[source,java]
----
@DomainObject(bookmarking=BookmarkPolicy.AS_CHILD)
public abstract class Unit { /* ... */ }
----

The nesting can be done to any level; the Estatio screenshot also shows a bookmark nesting `Lease` > `LeaseItem` >  `LeaseTerm` (3 levels deep).
