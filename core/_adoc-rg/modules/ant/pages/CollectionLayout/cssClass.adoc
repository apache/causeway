The `cssClass()` attribute can be used to render additional CSS classes in the HTML (a wrapping `<div>`) that represents the collection.   xref:rg:cfg:application-specific/application-css.adoc[Application-specific CSS] can then be used to target and adjust the UI representation of that particular element.



For example:

[source,java]
----
public class ToDoItem {
    @CollectionLayout(
        cssClass="x-important"
    )
    public SortedSet<ToDoItem> getDependencies() { /* ... */ }
    ...
}
----


== Alternatives


As an alternative to using the annotation, the dynamic xref:vw:ROOT:layout/file-based.adoc[file-based layout] can be used instead.
