For a domain service action that _can_ be contributed, the `contributedAs()` attribute determines how it is contributed: as an action or as an association (ie a property or collection).

The distinction between property or collection is automatic: if the action returns a `java.util.Collection` (or subtype) then the action is contributed as a collection; otherwise it is contributed as a property.

For a domain service action to be contributed, the domain services must have a xref:rg:ant:DomainService/nature.adoc[nature] nature of either `VIEW` or `VIEW_CONTRIBUTIONS_ONLY`, and the action must have xref:rg:ant:Action/semantics.adoc[safe action semantics], and takes a single argument, namely the contributee domain object.

For example:

[source,java]
----
@DomainService(nature=NatureOfService.VIEW_CONTRIBUTIONS_ONLY)
public class CustomerContributions {
    @Action(semantics=SemanticsOf.SAFE)
    @ActionLayout(contributedAs=Contributed.AS_ASSOCIATION)
    public List<Order> mostRecentOrders(Customer customer) { /* ... */ }
    ...
}
----

[TIP]
====
The `@ActionLayout` is not required if the action does not have safe semantics, or if the action takes more than one argument; in these cases the action can only be contributed _as_ an action.
====


It's also possible to use the attribute to suppress the action completely:

[source,java]
----
@DomainService(nature=NatureOfService.VIEW)
public class OrderContributions {
    @ActionLayout(contributedAs=Contributed.AS_NEITHER)
    public void cancel(Order order);
    ...
}
----

In such cases, though, it would probably make more sense to annotate the action as either xref:rg:ant:Action/hidden.adoc[hidden] or indeed xref:rg:ant:Programmatic.adoc[`@Programmatic`].



[NOTE]
====
Unlike other `@ActionLayout` attributes, this attribute _cannot_ be specified using a file-based layout because it relates to the contributor domain service, not the contributee domain object.
