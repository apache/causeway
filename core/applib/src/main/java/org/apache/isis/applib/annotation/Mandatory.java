/**
 * Indicates that a property is mandatory.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Isis' default is that properties are mandatory unless otherwise
 * annotated as optional, most typically indicated using the {@link Optional} annotation.
 * 
 * <p>
 * However, if using the JDO/DataNucleus objectstore, it is sometimes necessary
 * to annotate a property as optional (using <tt>javax.jdo.annotations.Column(allowNulls="true")</tt>) 
 * even if the property is logically mandatory.  For example, this can occur when
 * the property is in a subtype class that has been "rolled up" to the superclass
 * table using <tt>@javax.jdo.annotations.Inheritance(strategy=InheritanceStrategy.SUPERCLASS_TABLE)</tt>.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This annotation, therefore, is intended to override any objectstore-specific
 * annotation, so that Isis can apply the constraint even though the objectstore
 * is unable to do so.
