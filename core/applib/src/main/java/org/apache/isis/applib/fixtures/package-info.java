/**
 * Defines the {@link org.apache.isis.applib.fixtures.InstallableFixture}
 * interface and supporting classes.
 *
 * <p>
 *     <b>NOTE THAT</b> {@link org.apache.isis.testing.fixtures.applib.fixturescripts.FixtureScript} interface provides a more complete
 *     approach to handling fixtures, and should generally be used in preference to
 *     {@link org.apache.isis.applib.fixtures.InstallableFixture}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Fixtures are used to initialize the system, typically for either testing
 * or for demo/prototyping purposes.  Initializing the system means:
 * <ul>
 * <li><p>setting up objects within the persistent object store (typically only relevant
 * if using the in-memory object store; other object stores will generally
 * ignore these fixtures)</p></li>
 * <li><p>setting the current {@link org.apache.isis.applib.fixtures.DateFixture date}</p></li>
 * <li><p>{@link org.apache.isis.applib.fixtures.SwitchUserFixture switching}
 * the current user while fixtures are being installed (eg so that a workflow
 * can be picked up midway through)</p></li>
 * <li><p>specifying the {@link org.apache.isis.applib.fixtures.LogonFixture currently logged on} user once the fixtures have been installed</p></li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * Fixtures are typically combined into a {@link org.apache.isis.applib.fixtures.CompositeFixture composite}
 * pattern; the {@link org.apache.isis.applib.fixtures.AbstractFixture} adapter
 * class provides built-in support for this if required.
