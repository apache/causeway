/**
 * Provides a mechanism for parsing and rendering string representations of
 * objects.
 *
 * <p>
 * Specifically, this interface embodies three related capabilities:
 * <ul>
 * <li>to parse a string representation and convert to an object.
 * <li>to provide a string representation of the object, for use as its title.
 * <li>to indicate the typical length of such a string representation.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * For custom-written (as opposed to third-party) value types, the ability for
 * the {@link Parser} to provide a title responsibilities overlap with other
 * conventions for domain objects. Specifically, normally we write a
 * <tt>title()</tt> method to return a title. In such cases a typical
 * implementation of {@link Parser} would just delegate to the value type itself
 * to obtain the title (ie invoking the <tt>title()</tt> method directly rather
 * than having the framework do this).
 *
 * <p>
 * Similarly, the ability to return a typical length also overlaps with the
 * {@link TypicalLength} annotation; which is why {@link TypicalLength} cannot
 * be applied to types, only to properties and parameters.
 *
 * <p>
 * For third-party value types, eg {@see http://timeandmoney.sourceforge.net/
 * Time-and-Money} there is no ability to write <tt>title()</tt> methods or
 * annotated with {@link TypicalLength}; so this is the main reason that this
 * interface has to deal with titles and lengths.
 *
 * <p>
 * This interface is used in two complementary ways:
 * <ul>
 * <li>As one option, it allows objects to take control of their own parsing, by
 * implementing directly. However, the instance is used as a factory for itself.
 * The framework will instantiate an instance, invoke the appropriate method
 * method, and use the returned object. The instantiated instance itself will be
 * discarded.</li>
 * <li>Alternatively, an implementor of this interface can be nominated in the
 * {@link org.apache.isis.applib.annotation.Parseable} annotation, allowing a
 * class that needs to be parseable to indicate how it can be parsed.</li>
 *
 * <p>
 * Whatever the class that implements this interface, it must also expose either
 * a <tt>public</tt> no-arg constructor, or (for implementations that also are
 * <tt>Facet</tt>s) a <tt>public</tt> constructor that accepts a single
 * <tt>FacetHolder</tt>. This constructor allows the framework to instantiate
 * the object reflectively.
 *
 * @see DefaultsProvider
 * @see EncoderDecoder
 * @see ValueSemanticsProvider
