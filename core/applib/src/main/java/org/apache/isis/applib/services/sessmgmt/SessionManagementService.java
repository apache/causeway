/**
 * Intended primarily for {@link FixtureScript}s that define long-running/large
 * jobs, eg as used for migration; the intention is to allow that work to be broken into separate batches, each in
 * their own session, but all within a single request.
 *
 * <p>
 *     Care must be taken not to use any objects from one session to the next.  In other words, the service does
 *     <i>not</i> detach any persistent objects in one session and re-attach them in the next.  Also, any objects
 *     created in previous sessions cannot be exposed in the UI.  In practical terms this means that
 *     {@link FixtureScript.ExecutionContext#addResult(FixtureScript, Object)}
 *     must not be called.
