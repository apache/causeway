The `menuOrder()` attribute determines the ordering of a domain service's actions as menu items within a specified menu bar and top-level menu.


The algorithm works as follows:

* first, the xref:refguide:applib-ant:DomainServiceLayout.adoc#menuBar[`menuBar()`] determines which of the three menu bars the service's actions should be rendered
* then, the domain service's top-level name (typically explicitly specified using xref:refguide:applib-ant:DomainServiceLayout.adoc#named[`named()`]) is used to determine the top-level menu item to be rendered on the menu bar
* finally, if there is more than domain service that has the same name, then the `menuOrder` attribute is used to order those actions on the menu item drop-down.

For example, the screenshot below shows the "prototyping" menu from the (non-ASF) http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-app-todoapp[Isis addons' todoapp]:

The xref:vw:ROOT:about.adoc[Wicket viewer] automatically places separators between actions from different domain services.  From this we can infer that there are actually five different domain services that are all rendered on the "prototyping" top-level menu.

One of these is the todoapp's `DemoDomainEventSubscriptions` service:

[source,java]
----
@DomainService(
        nature = NatureOfService.VIEW_MENU_ONLY
)
@DomainServiceLayout(
        menuBar = MenuBar.SECONDARY,
        named = "Prototyping",                   // <1>
        menuOrder = "500.20")                    // <2>
public class DemoDomainEventSubscriptions {
    @ActionLayout(named="Set subscriber behaviour")
    @MemberOrder(sequence = "500.20.1")          // <3>
    public void subscriberBehaviour(...) { /* ... */ }
    ...
}
----
<1> render on the "Prototyping" menu
<2> positioning relative to other service's on the "Prototyping" menu
<3> by convention (nothing more) the `@MemberOrder#sequence()` attribute continues the same Dewey decimal sequence format (a simple string "1" could in fact have been used instead)


while others come from services provided by Apache Isis itself, eg:

[source,java]
----
@DomainServiceLayout(
        named = "Prototyping",              // <1>
        menuBar = MenuBar.SECONDARY,
        menuOrder = "500.500"               // <2>
)
public class MetaModelServicesMenu {
    @MemberOrder(sequence="500.500.1")      // <3>
    public Clob downloadMetaModel( ... ) { /* ... */ }
    ...
}
----
<1> render on the "Prototyping" menu
<2> positioning relative to other service's on the "Prototyping" menu; this appears after the `DemoDomainEventSubscriptions` service shown above
<3> by convention (nothing more) the `@MemberOrder#sequence()` attribute continues the same Dewey decimal sequence format (a simple string "1", "2", "3", ... could in fact have been used instead)
