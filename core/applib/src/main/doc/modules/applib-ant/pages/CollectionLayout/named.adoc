The `named()` attribute explicitly specifies the collection's name, overriding the name that would normally be inferred from the Java source code.


[TIP]
====
Following the link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself[don't repeat yourself] principle, we recommend that you only use this attribute when the desired name cannot be used in Java source code.
Examples of that include a name that would be a reserved Java keyword (eg "package"), or a name that has punctuation, eg apostrophes.
====


By default the name is HTML escaped.
To allow HTML markup, set the related `namedEscaped()` attribute to `false`.


For example:

[source,java]
----
public class ToDoItem {
    @CollectionLayout(
        named="Todo items that are <i>dependencies</i> of this item",
        namedEscaped=false
    )
    public SortedSet<ToDoItem getDependencies() { /* ... */ }
    ...
}
----



== Alternatives

As an alternative to using the annotation, the dynamic xref:vw:ROOT:layout.adoc#file-based[file-based layout] can be used instead.

The framework also provides a separate, powerful mechanism for xref:userguide:btb:i18n.adoc[internationalization].
