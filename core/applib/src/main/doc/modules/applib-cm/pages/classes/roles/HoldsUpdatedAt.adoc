The `HoldsUpdatedAt` role interface allows the (framework-provided) `TimestampService` to update each object with the current timestamp whenever it is modified in a transaction.

The interface is defined as:

[source,java]
----
public interface HoldsUpdatedAt {
    void setUpdatedAt(java.sql.Timestamp updatedAt);
}
----

The current time is obtained from the xref:refguide:applib-svc:core-domain-api/ClockService.adoc[`ClockService`].

Entities that implement this interface often also implement xref:refguide:applib-cm:classes.adoc#HoldsUpdatedBy[`HoldsUpdatedBy`] role interface; as a convenience the xref:refguide:applib-cm:classes.adoc#Timestampable[`Timestampable`] interface combines the two roles.



== Alternative approaches

An alternative way to maintain a timestamp is to use JDO's `@Version` annotation.
With this approach, it is the JDO/DataNucleus that maintains the version, rather than the framework's `TimestampService`.

For example:

[source,java]
----
@javax.jdo.annotations.Version(
        strategy=VersionStrategy.DATE_TIME,
        column="version")
public class Customer {
    ...
    public java.sql.Timestamp getVersionSequence() {
        return (java.sql.Timestamp) JDOHelper.getVersion(this);
    }
}
----
