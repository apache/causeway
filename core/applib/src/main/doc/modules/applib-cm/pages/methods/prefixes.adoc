Supporting methods are those that are associated with properties, collections and actions, providing additional imperative business rule checking and behaviour to be performed when the user interacts with those object members.

This association is performed by name matching.  Thus, a property called "firstName", derived from a method `getFirstName()` may have supporting methods `hideFirstName()`, `disableFirstName()` and `validateFirstName()`.  Supporting methods are, therefore, each characterized by their own particular prefix.


[NOTE]
====
Using name matching to associate supporting methods generally works very well, but of course if an object member's method is renamed, there's always the risk that the developer forgets to rename the supporting method; the supporting methods become "orphaned".

Apache Isis checks for this automatically, and will fail-fast (fail to boot) if any orphaned methods are located.  A suitable error message is logged so that the issue can be easily diagnosed.

The table below lists the method prefixes that are recognized as part of Apache Isis' default programming model.
