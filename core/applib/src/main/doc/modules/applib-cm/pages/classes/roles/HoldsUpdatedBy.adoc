The `HoldsUpdatedBy` role interface ...

NOTE: FIXME ... incomplete

[source,java]
----
public interface HoldsUpdatedBy {
    void setUpdatedBy(String updatedBy);
}
----

Entities that implement this interface often also implement xref:refguide:applib-cm:classes.adoc#HoldsUpdatedAt[`HoldsUpdatedAt`] role interface; as a convenience the xref:refguide:applib-cm:classes.adoc#Timestampable[`Timestampable`] interface combines the two roles.
