This is a convenience superclass for creating subscriber domain services on the xref:refguide:applib-svc:core-domain-api/EventBusService.adoc[`EventBusService`].
It uses xref:refguide:applib-ant:PostConstruct.adoc[`@PostConstruct`] and xref:refguide:applib-ant:PreDestroy.adoc[`@PreDestroy`] callbacks to automatically register/unregister itself with the `EventBusService`.

It's important that subscribers register before any domain services that might emit events on the xref:refguide:applib-svc:core-domain-api/EventBusService.adoc[`EventBusService`].
For example, the xref:secman:ROOT:about.adoc[SecMan extension] provides a domain service that automatically seeds certain domain entities; these will generate xref:refguide:applib-cm:classes/lifecycleevent.adoc[lifecycle events] and so any subscribers must be registered before such seed services.
The easiest way to do this is to use the Spring link:https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/annotation/Order.html[`@Order`] annotation.

As a convenience, the `AbstractSubscriber` specifies this attribute.
