|`AS_ROOT`, `NEVER` +

|Any string valid as a CSS class
|an additional CSS class around the HTML that represents for the action, to allow targetted styling in xref:refguide:config:application-specific/application-css.adoc[`application.css`]. +

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class ToDoItems {
    @Action(semantics=SemanticsOf.SAFE)             // <1>
    @ActionLayout(
        bookmarking=BookmarkPolicy.AS_ROOT,
        cssClass="x-key",
        cssClassFa="fa-checkbox",
        describedAs="Mark the todo item as not complete after all",
        hidden=Where.NOWHERE                        // <2>
    )
    @MemberOrder(sequence = "1")
    public List<ToDoItem> notYetComplete() {
        ...
    }
}
----
<1> required for bookmarkable actions
<2> default value, so could be omitted


[TIP]
====
As an alternative to using the `@ActionLayout` annotation, a xref:vw:ROOT:layout/file-based.adoc[file-based layout] can be used (and is generally to be preferred since it is more flexible/powerful).
