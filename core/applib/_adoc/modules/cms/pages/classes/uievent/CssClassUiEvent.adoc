This event class represents a request to obtain the a CSS class hint of a domain object.  The class has a number of
responsibilities:

* capture the target object being interacted with

* capture the CSS class, if any, as specified to one of the subscribers

The class itself is instantiated automatically by the framework whenever interacting with a rendered object's action.


[NOTE]
====
if the domain object defines its own xref:rg:cms:methods.adoc#cssClass[`cssClass()`] supporting
method then this will take precedence.
