TODO: v2: this service has been deleted - remove this doc and update the migration guide.

The `GuiceBeanProvider` domain service acts as a bridge between Apache Isis' xref:vw:ROOT:about.adoc[Wicket viewer] internal bootstrapping using link:https://github.com/google/guice[Google Guice].

This service operates at a very low-level, and you are unlikely to have a need for it.
It is used internally by the framework, in the default implementation of the xref:refguide:applib-svc:presentation-api/DeepLinkService.adoc[`DeepLinkService`].

[NOTE]
====
Currently Apache Isis uses a combination of Guice (within the Wicket viewer only) and a home-grown dependency injection framework.
In future versions we intended to refactor the framework to use CDI throughout.
At that time this service is likely to become redundant because we will allow any of the internal components of Apache Isis to be injected into your domain object code.
====


== API & Implementation

The API defined by this service is:

[source,java]
----
public interface GuiceBeanProvider {
    @Programmatic
    <T> T lookup(Class<T> beanType);
    @Programmatic
    <T> T lookup(Class<T> beanType, final Annotation qualifier);
}
----

The xref:vw:ROOT:about.adoc[Wicket viewer] this provides a default implementation of this service.

To use an alternative implementation, implement the `GuideBeanProvider` interface and use xref:refguide:applib-ant:DomainServiceLayout.adoc#menuOrder[`@DomainServiceLayout#menuOrder()`] (as explained in the xref:refguide:applib-svc:intro/overriding-the-services.adoc[introduction] to this guide).




== Usage

Using the xref:vw:ROOT:about.adoc[Wicket viewer] requires subclassing of `IsisWicketApplication`.
In the subclass it is commonplace to override `newIsisWicketModule()`, for example:

[source,java]
----
@Override
protected Module newIsisWicketModule() {
    final Module isisDefaults = super.newIsisWicketModule();
    final Module overrides = new AbstractModule() {
        @Override
        protected void configure() {
            bind(String.class).annotatedWith(Names.named("applicationName"))
                              .toInstance("ToDo App");
            bind(String.class).annotatedWith(Names.named("applicationCss"))
                              .toInstance("css/application.css");
            bind(String.class).annotatedWith(Names.named("applicationJs"))
                              .toInstance("scripts/application.js");
            ...
        }
    };
    return Modules.override(isisDefaults).with(overrides);
}
----

This "module" is in fact a Guice module, and so the `GuiceBeanProvider` service can be used to lookup any of the components bound into it.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class SomeDomainObject {
    private String lookupApplicationName() {
        return guiceBeanProvider.lookup(String.class, Names.named("applicationName"));
    }
    @Inject
    GuiceBeanProvider guiceBeanProvider;
}
----

should return "ToDo App".
