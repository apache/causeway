The `cssClassFa()` attribute is used to specify the name of a link:http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/[Font Awesome icon] name, to be rendered on the action's representation as a button or menu item.    The related `cssClassFaPosition()` attribute specifies the positioning of the icon, to the left or the right of the text.

These attributes can also be applied to xref:applib:ant:DomainObjectLayout.adoc#cssClassFa[domain objects] and to xref:applib:ant:ViewModelLayout.adoc#cssClassFa[view models] to specify the object's icon.


For example:

[source,java]
----
public class ToDoItem {
    @ActionLayout(
        cssClassFa="fa-step-backward"
    )
    public ToDoItem previous() { /* ... */ }

    @ActionLayout(
        cssClassFa="fa-step-forward",
        cssClassFaPosition=ActionLayout.CssClassFaPosition.RIGHT
    )
    public ToDoItem next() { /* ... */ }
}
----

There can be multiple "fa-" classes, eg to mirror or rotate the icon. There is no need to include the mandatory `fa` "marker" CSS class; it will be automatically added to the list.  The `fa-` prefix can also be omitted from the class names; it will be prepended to each if required.


== Alternatives

As an alternative to using the annotation, the dynamic xref:vw:ROOT:layout/file-based.adoc[file-based layout] can be used instead.


[NOTE]
====
The similar xref:applib:ant:ActionLayout.adoc#cssClass[`@ActionLayout#cssClass()`] annotation attribute is also used as a hint to apply CSS, but for wrapping the representation of an object or object member so that it can be styled in an application-specific way.
