The `publishing()` attribute determines whether and how an action invocation is published via the registered implementation of xref:applib:svc:persistence-layer-spi/PublisherService.adoc[`PublisherService`].

A common use case is to notify external "downstream" systems of changes in the state of the Apache Isis application.
The default value for the attribute is `AS_CONFIGURED`, meaning that the xref:cfg:ROOT:configuring-core.adoc[configuration property] `isis.services.publish.actions` is used to determine the whether the action is published:

* `all` +
+
all action invocations are published

* `ignoreSafe` (or `ignoreQueryOnly`) +
+
invocations of actions with safe (read-only) semantics are ignored, but actions which may modify data are not ignored

* `none` +
+
no action invocations are published

If there is no configuration property in `isis.properties` then publishing is automatically enabled.

This default can be overridden on an action-by-action basis; if `publishing()` is set to `ENABLED` then the action invocation is published irrespective of the configured value; if set to `DISABLED` then the action invocation is _not_ published, again irrespective of the configured value.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Order {
    @Action(publishing=Publishing.ENABLED)        // <1>
    public Invoice generateInvoice(...) { /* ... */ }
}
----
<1> because set to enabled, will be published irrespective of the configured value.

* xref:applib:ant:DomainObject.adoc#publishing[domain objects]
+ where it controls whether changed objects are published as events, and for

* xref:applib:ant:Property.adoc#publishing[properties]
+
where it controls whether property edits are published as events.
