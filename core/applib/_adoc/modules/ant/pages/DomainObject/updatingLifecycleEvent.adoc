Whenever a (persistent) domain object has been modified and is about to be updated to the database, an "updating" lifecycle event is fired.

Subscribers subscribe through the xref:applib:svc:core-domain-api/EventBusService.adoc[`EventBusService`] and can use the event to obtain a reference to the domain object.
The subscriber could then, for example, update the object, or it could use it maintain an external datastore.
One possible application is to maintain a full-text search database using link:https://lucene.apache.org/[Apache Lucene] or similar.

[NOTE]
====
Another use case is to maintain "last updated by"/"last updated at" properties.
While you can roll your own, note that the framework provides built-in support for this use case through the
xref:applib:cms:classes/roles.adoc#Timestampable[`Timestampable`] role interface.
====

By default the event raised is `ObjectUpdatingEvent.Default`.
For example:

[source,java]
----
@DomainObject
public class ToDoItemDto {
    ...
}
----

The purpose of the `updatingLifecycleEvent()` attribute is to allows a custom subclass to be emitted instead.
A similar attribute is available for other lifecycle events.

For example:

[source,java]
----
@DomainObjectLayout(
    updatingLifecycleEvent=ToDoItem.UpdatingEvent.class
)
public class ToDoItem {
    public static class UpdatingEvent
        extends org.apache.isis.applib.events.lifecycle.ObjectUpdatingEvent<ToDoItem> { }
    ...
}
----

The benefit is that subscribers can be more targeted as to the events that they subscribe to.




== Subscribers

Subscribers (which must be domain services) subscribe using either the link:https://github.com/google/guava[Guava] API or (if the xref:applib:svc:core-domain-api/EventBusService.adoc[`EventBusService`] has been appropriately configured) using the link:http://www.axonframework.org/[Axon Framework] API.
The examples below are compatible with both.

Subscribers can be either coarse-grained (if they subscribe to the top-level event type):

[source,java]
----
import org.springframework.context.event.EventListener;

@DomainService(nature=NatureOfService.DOMAIN)
public class SomeSubscriber extends AbstractSubscriber {
    @EventListener(ObjectUpdatingEvent.class)
    public void on(ObjectUpdatingEvent ev) {
        if(ev.getSource() instanceof ToDoItem) {
            // ...
        }
    }
}
----

or can be fine-grained (by subscribing to specific event subtypes):

[source,java]
----
import org.springframework.context.event.EventListener;

@DomainService(nature=NatureOfService.DOMAIN)
public class SomeSubscriber extends AbstractSubscriber {
    @EventListener(ToDoItem.ObjectUpdatingEvent.class)
    public void on(ToDoItem.ObjectUpdatingEvent ev) {
        // ...
    }
}
----





== Default, Doop and Noop events

If the `updatingLifecycleEvent` attribute is not explicitly specified (is left as its default value, `ObjectUpdatingEvent.Default`),
then the framework will, by default, post an event.

If this is not required, then the `isis.reflector.facet.domainObjectAnnotation.updatingLifecycleEvent.postForDefault` configuration property can be set to "false"; this will disable posting.

On the other hand, if the `updatingLifecycleEvent` has been explicitly specified to some subclass, then an event will be posted.
The framework provides `ObjectUpdatingEvent.Doop` as such a subclass, so setting the `updatingLifecycleEvent` attribute to this class will ensure that the event to be posted, irrespective of the configuration property setting.

And, conversely, the framework also provides `ObjectUpdatingEvent.Noop`; if `updatingLifecycleEvent` attribute is set to this class, then no event will be posted.
