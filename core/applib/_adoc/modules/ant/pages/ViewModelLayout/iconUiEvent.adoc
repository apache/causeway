Whenever a view model is to be rendered, the framework fires off an icon UI event to obtain an icon (name) for the object (if possible).
This is as an alternative to implementing xref:rg:cms:methods.adoc#iconName[`iconName()`] reserved method.
(If `iconName()` is present, then it will take precedence).

This attribute is the same as xref:applib:ant:DomainObjectLayout.adoc#iconUiEvent[`@DomainObjectLayout#iconUiEvent()`], but for view models instead of entities.

A default event that is emitted if none specified, unless the `isis.reflector.facet.viewModelLayoutAnnotation.iconUiEvent.postForDefault` configuration property is set to "false".
