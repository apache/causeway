Whenever a domain object (or list of domain objects) is to be rendered, the framework fires off multiple domain events for every property, collection and action of the domain object.
In the cases of the domain object's properties, the events that are fired are:

* hide phase: to check that the property is visible (has not been hidden)
* disable phase: to check that the property is usable (has not been disabled)
* validate phase: to check that the property's arguments are valid (to modify/clear its value)
* pre-execute phase: before the modification of the property
* post-execute: after the modification of the property

Subscribers subscribe through the xref:rg:svc:core-domain-api/EventBusService.adoc[`EventBusService`] using either link:https://github.com/google/guava[Guava] or link:http://www.axonframework.org/[Axon Framework] annotations and can influence each of these phases.

By default the event raised is `PropertyDomainEvent.Default`.
For example:

[source,java]
----
public class ToDoItem {
    @Property()
    public LocalDate getDueBy() { /* ... */ }
    ...
}
----

The `domainEvent()` attribute allows a custom subclass to be emitted allowing more precise subscriptions (to those subclasses) to be defined instead.


For example:

[source,java]
----
public class ToDoItem {
    public static class DueByChangedEvent extends PropertyDomainEvent<ToDoItem, LocalDate> { }  // <1>
    @Property(domainEvent=ToDoItem.DueByChangedEvent)
    public LocalDate getDueBy() { /* ... */ }
    ...
}
----
<1> inherit from `PropertyDomainEvent<T,P>` where `T` is the type of the domain object being interacted with, and `P` is the type of the property (`LocalDate` in this example)

The benefit is that subscribers can be more targetted as to the events that they subscribe to.

[NOTE]
====
The framework provides a no-arg constructor and will initialize the domain event using (non-API) setters rather than through the constructor.
This substantially reduces the boilerplate in the subclasses because no explicit constructor is required..

== Subscribers

Subscribers (which must be domain services) subscribe using either the link:https://github.com/google/guava[Guava] API or (if the xref:rg:svc:core-domain-api/EventBusService.adoc[`EventBusService`] has been appropriately configured) using the link:http://www.axonframework.org/[Axon Framework] API.
The examples below use the Guava API.

Subscribers can be either coarse-grained (if they subscribe to the top-level event type):

[source,java]
----
@DomainService(nature=NatureOfService.DOMAIN)
public class SomeSubscriber extends AbstractSubscriber {
    @com.google.common.eventbus.Subscribe
    public void on(PropertyDomainEvent ev) {
        ...
    }
}
----

or can be fine-grained (by subscribing to specific event subtypes):

[source,java]
----
import org.springframework.context.event.EventListener;

@DomainService(nature=NatureOfService.DOMAIN)
public class SomeSubscriber extends AbstractSubscriber {
    @EventListener(ToDoItem.DueByChangedEvent.class)
    public void on(ToDoItem.DueByChangedEvent ev) {
        // ...
    }
}
----

The subscriber's method is called (up to) 5 times:

* whether to veto visibility (hide)
* whether to veto usability (disable)
* whether to veto execution (validate)
* steps to perform prior to the property being modified
* steps to perform after the property has been modified.

The subscriber can distinguish these by calling `ev.getEventPhase()`.
Thus the general form is:

[source,java]
----
import org.springframework.context.event.EventListener;

@DomainService(nature=NatureOfService.DOMAIN)
public class SomeSubscriber extends AbstractSubscriber {

    public void on(PropertyDomainEvent ev) {
        switch(ev.getEventPhase()) {
            case HIDE:
                // call ev.hide() or ev.veto("") to hide the property
                break;
            case DISABLE:
                // call ev.disable("...") or ev.veto("...") to disable the property
                break;
            case VALIDATE:
                // call ev.invalidate("...") or ev.veto("...")
                // if proposed property value is invalid
                break;
            case EXECUTING:
                break;
            case EXECUTED:
                break;
        }
    }
}
----

It is also possible to abort the transaction during the executing or executed phases by throwing an exception.
If the exception is a subtype of `RecoverableException` then the exception will be rendered as a user-friendly warning (eg Growl/toast) rather than an error.




== Default, Doop and Noop events

If the `domainEvent` attribute is not explicitly specified (is left as its default value, `PropertyDomainEvent.Default`), then the framework will, by default, post an event.

If this is not required, then the `isis.reflector.facet.propertyAnnotation.domainEvent.postForDefault` configuration property can be set to "false"; this will disable posting.

On the other hand, if the `domainEvent` has been explicitly specified to some subclass, then an event will be posted.
The framework provides `PropertyDomainEvent.Doop` as such a subclass, so setting the `domainEvent` attribute to this class will ensure that the event to be posted, irrespective of the configuration property setting.

And, conversely, the framework also provides `PropertyDomainEvent.Noop`; if `domainEvent` attribute is set to this class, then no event will be posted.





== Raising events programmatically

Normally events are only raised for interactions through the UI.
However, events can be raised programmatically by wrapping the target object using the xref:rg:svc:application-layer-api/WrapperFactory.adoc[`WrapperFactory`] service.

This attribute is also supported for:

* xref:rg:ant:Action.adoc#domainEvent[actions] and
* xref:rg:ant:Property.adoc#domainEvent[properties].
