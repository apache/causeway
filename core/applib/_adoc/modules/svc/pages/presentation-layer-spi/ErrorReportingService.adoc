The `ErrorReportingService` service is an optional SPI that provides the ability to record any errors/exceptions that might occur in the application into an external incident recording system (such as JIRA or Slack).
The service also allows a user-friendly (jargon-free) error message to be returned and rendered to the end-user, along with an optional incident reference (eg a JIRA issue `XXX-1234`).
The service can also return a URL for an external image.
For example, this could be to a comic strip or (as a bit of fun) a picture of a random kitten.



== SPI

The SPI defined by this service is:

[source,java]
----
public interface ErrorReportingService {
    Ticket reportError(ErrorDetails errorDetails);
}
----

where `ErrorDetails` provided to the service is:

[source,java]
----
public class ErrorDetails {
    public String getMainMessage() { /* ... */ }          // <1>
    public boolean isRecognized() { /* ... */ }           // <2>
    public boolean isAuthorizationCause() { /* ... */ }   // <3>
    public List<String> getStackTraceDetailList() { // <4>
}
----
<1> the main message to be displayed to the end-user.
The service is responsible for translating this into the language of the end-user (it can use xref:rg:svc:presentation-layer-spi/LocaleProvider.adoc[`LocaleProvider`] if required).
<2> whether this message has already been recognized by an xref:rg:svc:presentation-layer-spi/ExceptionRecognizer.adoc[`ExceptionRecognizer`] service.
Generally this converts potentially non-recoverable (fatal) exceptions into recoverable exceptions (warnings) as well providing an alternative mechanism for generating user-friendly error messages.
<3> whether the cause of the exception was due to a lack of privileges.
In such cases the UI restricts the information shown to the end-user, to avoid leaking potentially sensitive information
<4> the stack trace of the exception, including the trace of any exceptions in the causal chain.
These technical details are hidden from the user and only shown for non-recoverable exceptions.


and `Ticket` (returned by the service) is an interface:

[source,java]
----
public interface Ticket extends Serializable {

    enum StackTracePolicy { SHOW, HIDE }

    String getReference();                      // <1>
    String getUserMessage();                    // <2>
    String getDetails();                        // <3>
    StackTracePolicy getStackTracePolicy();     // <4>
    String getMarkup();                         // <5>
}
----
<1> is a unique identifier that the end-user can use to track any follow-up from this error.
For example, an implementation might automatically log an issue in a bug tracking system such as JIRA, in which case the reference would
probably be the JIRA issue number <tt>XXX-1234</tt>.
<2> a short, jargon-free message to display to the end-user.
<3> is optional additional details to show.
For example, these might include text on how to recover from the error, or workarounds, or just further details on contacting the help desk if the issue is severe and requires immediate attention.
<4> is optional, specifying whether to show a button to view details of the stack trace.
By default a stack trace button is not shown if a ticket is returned (but _is_ shown if there is no `ErrorReportingService` configured, or if it returns no ticket).
<5> returns a Html representation of this ticket.




== Implementation

There is no default implementation of this service, but there are a couple of concrete examples of `Ticket` in `core-runtime`.

The (non-ASF) http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-app-kitchensink[Isis addons' kitchensink] app provides an example implementation:

[source,java]
----
@DomainService( nature = NatureOfService.DOMAIN )
public class KitchensinkErrorReportingService implements ErrorReportingService {
    private int ticketNumber = 1;
    @Override
    public Ticket reportError(final ErrorDetails errorDetails) {
        return new Ticket(
                nextTicketReference(),
                errorDetails.getMainMessage(),
                  "By way of an apology, \n"
                          + "here's a picture of a \n"
                          + "kitten for you to look at.",
                "http://www.randomkittengenerator.com/cats/rotator.php"
                );
    }
    String nextTicketReference() {
        return "" + ticketNumber++;
    }
}
----
