If using the text-based xref:security:shiro:ini-realm.adoc[`IniRealm`] or xref:security:shiro-realm-ldap:about.adoc[Apache Isis' LDAP realm], then note that Shiro also allows the string representation of the permissions to be mapped (resolved) to alternative `Permission` instances.
Apache Isis provides its own `IsisPermission` which introduces the concept of a "veto".

A vetoing permission is one that prevents access to a feature, rather than grants it.
This is useful in some situations where most users have access to most features, and only a small number of features are particularly sensitive.
The configuration can therefore be set up to grant fairly broad-brush permissions and then veto permission for the sensitive features for those users that do not have access.

The string representation of the `IsisPermission` uses the following format:

[source,ini]
----
([!]?)([^/]+)[/](.+)
----

where:

* the optional `!` prefix indicates this permission is a vetoing permission
* the optional `xxx/` prefix is a permission group that scopes any vetoing permissions
* the remainder of the string is the permission (possibly wild-carded, with :rw as optional suffix)


For example:

[source,ini]
----
user_role   = !reg/org.estatio.api,\
              !reg/org.estatio.webapp.services.admin,\
              reg/* ; \
api_role    = org.estatio.api ;\
admin_role = adm/*
----

sets up:

* the `user_role` with access to all permissions except those in `org.estatio.api` and `org.estatio.webapp.services.admin`
* the `api_role` with access to all permissions in `org.estatio.api`
* the `admin_role` with access to everything.

The permission group concept is required to scope the applicability of any veto permission.
This is probably best explained by an example.
Suppose that a user has both `admin_role` and `user_role`; we would want the `admin_role` to trump the vetos of the `user_role`, in other words to give the user access to everything.


Because of the permission groups, the two "+++!reg/...+""" vetos in user_role only veto out selected permissions granted by the "+++reg/*+++" permissions, but they do not veto the permissions granted by a different scope, namely "+++adm/*+++".

The net effect is therefore what we would want: that a user with both `admin_role` and `user_role` would have access to everything, irrespective of those two veto permissions of the `user_role`.



Finally, the Apache Isis permission resolver is specified in `WEB-INF/shiro.ini` file:

[source,ini]
----
permissionResolver = org.apache.isis.security.shiro.authorization.IsisPermissionResolver
myRealm.permissionResolver = $permissionResolver  # <1>
----
<1> `myRealm` is the handle to the configured realm, eg `$iniRealm` or `$isisLdapRealm` etc.
