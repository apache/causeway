The xref:vro:ROOT::about.adoc[RestfulObjects viewer] implements the http://restfulobjects.org[Restful Object spec], meaning
that it defines a well-defined set of endpoint URLs as resources, and generates a well-defined set of (JSON)
representations when these resources are accessed.

By default, the Restful Objects viewer will automatically handle requests and return representations according to the
RO spec.  However, its internal architecture provides several hooks for content negotiation, thereby allowing the
generated representation to be influenced using the standard HTTP `Accept` header.  In response, the server uses
the `Content-Type` header which the client can use to know how to process the returned representation.


* `RepresentationService` +
+
The xref:rg:fis:presentation-layer/RepresentationService.adoc[`RepresentationService`] is an SPI domain service (plugin-point)
that allows an arbitrary representation to be generated for any of the resources defined in the RO spec. +
+
Normally this SPI service need not be replaced, because the default implementation
(`RepresentationServiceContentNegotiator`) simply uses the HTTP `Accept` header and delegates onto another service, the
(slightly misnamed) `ContentNegotiationService`, to actually generate the representation.  There can be multiple
implementations of the `ContentNegotiationService` and the content negotiator will delegate to each in turn until one
is able to handle the request (per the chain of responsibliity pattern).

* `ContentNegotiationService` +
+
As noted above, there can be multiple implementations of the
xref:rg:fis:presentation-layer/ContentNegotiationService.adoc[`ContentNegotiationService`], each one handling a particular
HTTP `Accept` header.  If the implementation does not recognize the value of the header, if can simply return `null`. +
+
The framework provides a number of implementations; an implementation that handles the
xref:vro:ROOT::simplified-representations.adoc[simplified representation] of the Apache Isis profile; an implementation that provides support for the `x-ro-domain-type` parameter, and a
default/fallback implementation that returns the representations defined by the RO spec.

* `ContentMappingService` +
+
The xref:rg:svc:presentation-layer-spi/ContentMappingService.adoc[`ContentMappingService`] is used by the implementation of
`ContentNegotationService` that recognizes the `x-ro-domain-type`, its role being to transform a domain object
(usually an entity) into some other form (usually a DTO), as specified by the `x-ro-domain-type` parameter.  There
can be many such implementations, each handling a different target domain type.


This diagram shows how these services collaborate:

Taken together these domain services offer a lot of flexibility in terms of the representations that can be generated
from the RestfulObjects viewer.
