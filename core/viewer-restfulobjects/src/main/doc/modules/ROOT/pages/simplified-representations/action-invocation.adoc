When an action is invoked, it can return a domain object, a list, a scalar, or return nothing.

== Returning an Object

If the action returned an object, then the xref:vro:ROOT:simplified-representations.adoc#domain-object[domain object representation] is returned.

For example, using the (non-ASF) http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-app-todoapp[Isis addons' todoapp], accessing
this resource:

[source]
----
http://localhost:8080/restful/objects/TODO/45/actions/updateCost/invoke
----

with an `Accept` request header of:

[source]
----
Accept: application/json;profile="urn:org.apache.isis/v1"
----

returns the following representation:

[source]
----

{
  "$$href" : "http://localhost:8080/restful/objects/TODO/45",
  "$$instanceId" : "45",
  "$$title" : "Buy bread due by 2015-12-04",
  "description" : "Buy bread",
  "category" : "Domestic",
  "subcategory" : "Shopping",
  "complete" : false,
  ...
  "similarTo" : [ ... ]
  ...
  "$$ro" : { /* ... */ }
}
----

with a `Content-Type` of:

[source]
----
Content-Type: application/json;profile="urn:org.apache.isis/v1";repr-type="object"
----

\... in other words no different to a representation obtained of the returned domain object directly.


== Returning a List

On the other hand if the action returned a list (a "standalone" collection, then an array representation is returned.
This is very similar to that returned by a xref:vro:ROOT:simplified-representations.adoc#object-collection[(parented) object collection], though with a slightly different `Content-Type` to distinguish.

For example, using the (non-ASF) http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-app-todoapp[Isis addons' todoapp], accessing
this resource:

[source]
----
http://localhost:8080/restful/services/ToDoItems/actions/notYetComplete/invoke
----

with an `Accept` request header of:

[source]
----
Accept: application/json;profile="urn:org.apache.isis/v1"
----

returns the following representation:

[source]
----
[ {
  "$$href" : "http://localhost:8080/restful/objects/TODO/45",
  "$$instanceId" : "45",
  "$$title" : "Buy bread due by 2015-12-04",
  "description" : "Buy bread",
  "category" : "Domestic",
  ...
}, {
  "$$href" : "http://localhost:8080/restful/objects/TODO/46",
  "$$instanceId" : "46",
  "$$title" : "Buy milk due by 2015-12-04",
  "description" : "Buy milk",
  "category" : "Domestic",
  ...
},
...
, {
  "$$ro" : {
    "links" : [ ... ]
    "resulttype" : "list",
    "result" : { /* ... */ }
      "value" : [ ... ],
      "links" : [ ... ],
      "extensions" : { }
    }
  }
} ]
----

with a `Content-Type` header:

[source]
----
Content-Type: application/json;profile="urn:org.apache.isis/v1";repr-type="list"
----

== Returning Scalar/Nothing

Note that actions returning scalar values or nothing (which includes `void` actions) are not supported; for these the
regular RO spec representation will be returned.
