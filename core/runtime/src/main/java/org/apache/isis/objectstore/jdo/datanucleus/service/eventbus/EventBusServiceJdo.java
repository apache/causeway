 * {@link #post(Object) posted} from the setters of entities, automatically ignoring any calls to those setters that
 * occur as a side-effect of the JDO load/detach lifecycle.
 *
 * <p>
 * This implementation has no UI and there are no other implementations of the service API, and so it is annotated
 * with {@link org.apache.isis.applib.annotation.DomainService}.  Because it is implemented in the core, this means
 * that it is automatically registered and available for use; no further configuration is required.
