While it is good practice to place tables in schemas, the ORMs do not by default actually create those schema (as per link:https://crate.io/docs/sql-99/en/latest/chapters/17.html#create-schema-statement[CREATE SCHEMA] statement).

The framework therefore allows this to be configured:

* xref:refguide:config:sections/isis.persistence.schema.adoc#isis.persistence.schema.auto-create-schemas[isis.persistence.schema.auto-create-schemas]
+
whether to automatically create the schemas

* xref:refguide:config:sections/isis.persistence.schema.adoc#isis.persistence.schema.create-schema-sql-template[isis.persistence.schema.create-schema-sql-template]
+
the SQL text used to create the schema.
This should be an idempotent command, with the default being SQL-99 compliant:
+
[source,sql]
----
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS %S
----
+
The string is interpolated using `String.format()`, passing in the schema name (for all discovered schema names).
