introspector. +
lock-after-full-introspection
|  true
| If true, then no new specifications will be allowed to be loaded once introspection has been complete.

Only applies if the introspector is configured to perform full introspection up-front (either because of \{@link IntrospectionMode#FULL} or \{@link IntrospectionMode#LAZY_UNLESS_PRODUCTION} when in production); otherwise is ignored.


| isis.core.meta-model. +
introspector.mode
| 
| Whether all known types should be fully introspected as part of the bootstrapping, or should only be partially introspected initially.

Leaving this as lazy means that there's a chance that metamodel validation errors will not be discovered during bootstrap. That said, metamodel validation is still run incrementally for any classes introspected lazily after initial bootstrapping (unless \{@link #isValidateIncrementally()} is disabled.


| isis.core.meta-model. +
introspector.parallelize
|  true
| Whether to perform introspection in parallel.


| isis.core.meta-model. +
introspector. +
validate-incrementally
|  true
| If true, then metamodel validation is performed after any new specification has been loaded (after the initial bootstrapping).

This does _not_ apply if the introspector is configured to perform full introspection up-front AND when the metamodel is \{@link Core.MetaModel.Introspector#isLockAfterFullIntrospection() locked} after initial bootstrapping (because in that case the lock check will simply prevent any new specs from being loaded). But it will apply otherwise.

In particular, this setting _can_ still apply even if the \{@link Core.MetaModel.Introspector#getMode() introspection mode} is set to \{@link IntrospectionMode#FULL full}, because that in itself does not preclude some code from attempting to load some previously unknown type. For example, a fixture script could attempt to invoke an action on some new type using the \{@link org.apache.isis.applib.services.wrapper.WrapperFactory} - this will cause introspection of that new type to be performed.
