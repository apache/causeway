persistence-unit-load-classes
|  true
| Used when we have specified the persistence-unit name for a PMF/EMF and where we want the datastore "tables" for all classes of that persistence-unit loading up into the StoreManager.

Defaults to true, which is the opposite of DataNucleus' own default. (The reason that DN defaults to false is because some databases are slow so such an operation would slow down the startup process).

This should be set to `true` when running against an in-memory database, but set to `false` when running against a persistent database (use something like flyway instead to manage schema evolution).
