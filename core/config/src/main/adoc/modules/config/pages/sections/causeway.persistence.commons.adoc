|Description

[[causeway.persistence.commons.entity-change-tracker.suppress-auto-flush]]
causeway.persistence.commons. +
entity-change-tracker. +
suppress-auto-flush

|  true
| Normally any query submitted to ``RepositoryService#allMatches(Query)`` will trigger a flush first, unless auto-flush has been disabled.

However, this auto-flush behaviour can be troublesome if the query occurs as a side-effect of the evaluation of a derived property, whose value in turn is enlisted by an implementation of a subscriber (in particular ``EntityPropertyChangeSubscriber``) which captures the value of all properties (both persisted and derived). However, this behaviour can (at least under JDO), result in a ``ConcurrentModificationException``.

By default, ``EntityChangeTracker`` will therefore temporarily suppress any auto-flushing while this is ongoing. The purpose of this configuration property is to never suppress, ie always autoflush.


|
[[causeway.persistence.commons.repository-service.disable-auto-flush]]
causeway.persistence.commons. +
repository-service. +
disable-auto-flush

| 
| Normally any queries are automatically preceded by flushing pending executions.

This key allows this behaviour to be disabled.

NOTE: this key is redundant for JPA/EclipseLink, which supports its own auto-flush using https://www.eclipse.org/eclipselink/documentation/2.7/jpa/extensions/persistenceproperties_ref.htm#BABDHEEB[eclipselink.persistence-context.flush-mode]
