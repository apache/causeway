Note:

* In order for the lifecycle events to fire (`persisting`, `loaded` etc) the class must be annotated using `@DomainObject` (even if no attributes on that annotation are set).
* Similarly, for UI events to fire (`title`, `icon` etc) the class must be annotated using `@DomainObjectLayout` (even if no attributes on that annotation are set).
* Similarly, for domain events to fire (`title`, `icon` etc) the action/property/collection must be annotated using the appropriate `@XxxLayout` (even if no attributes on that annotation are set).


== Non-editable Objects

The `isis.applib.annotation.domain-object.editing` configuration property determines whether properties can be edited or not.
By default it is _disabled_:

[source,ini]
----
isis.applib.annotation.domain-object.editing=false
----
We recommend leaving this at its default, and only selectively enabling property editing where there are likely to be no business rules, such as "notes" or "comments" properties.
Doing so will help drive out the underlying business operations (processes and procedures) that require objects to change; these can then be captured as actions.
