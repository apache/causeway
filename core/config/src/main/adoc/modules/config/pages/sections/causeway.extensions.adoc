|Property
|Default
|Description
|
[[causeway.extensions.audit-trail.persist]]
causeway.extensions.audit-trail. +
persist

| 
| Whether the ``EntityPropertyChangeSubscriber`` implementation provided by this extension (which persists property changes to the audit trail) is enabled or not.

One reason to use this option is if you wish to provide your own implementation that wraps or delegates to the default implementation of ``EntityPropertyChangeSubscriber`` that is provided by the _audittrail_ extension. Because entity property changes are published to _all_ subscribers on the class path, you can disable the default implementation from doing anything using this setting.


|
[[causeway.extensions.command-log.persist]]
causeway.extensions.command-log. +
persist

| 
| Whether the ``CommandSubscriber`` implementation provided by this extension (which persists commands to the command log) is enabled or not.

One reason to use this option is if you wish to provide your own implementation that wraps or delegates to the default implementation of ``CommandSubscriber`` that is provided by the _commandlog_ extension. Because commands are published to _all_ subscribers on the class path, you can disable the default implementation from doing anything using this setting.


|
[[causeway.extensions.command-log.run-background-commands.batch-size]]
causeway.extensions.command-log. +
run-background-commands.batch-size

|  25
| Limits the number of pending commands that the ``RunBackgroundCommandsJob`` will execute. After these have been executed, any ``RunBackgroundCommandsJobListener``s are called.

By default, quartz runs this command every 10 seconds, so the size should be proportion to that.

|
[[causeway.extensions.cors.allow-credentials]]
causeway.extensions.cors. +
allow-credentials

| 
| Whether the resource supports user credentials.

This flag is exposed as part of 'Access-Control-Allow-Credentials' header in a pre-flight response. It helps browser determine whether or not an actual request can be made using credentials.

By default this is not set (i.e. user credentials are not supported).

For more information, check the usage of the ``credentials`` init parameter for https://github.com/eBay/cors-filter[EBay CORSFilter].


|
[[causeway.extensions.cors.allowed-headers]]
causeway.extensions.cors. +
allowed-headers

| 
| Which HTTP headers can be allowed in a CORS request.

These header will also be returned as part of 'Access-Control-Allow-Headers' header in a pre-flight response.

For more information, check the usage of the ``headers`` init parameter for https://github.com/eBay/cors-filter[EBay CORSFilter].


|
[[causeway.extensions.cors.allowed-methods]]
causeway.extensions.cors. +
allowed-methods

| 
| Which HTTP methods are permitted in a CORS request.

A comma separated list of HTTP methods that can be used to access the resource, using cross-origin requests. These are the methods which will also be included as part of 'Access-Control-Allow-Methods' header in a pre-flight response.

Default is ``GET``, ``POST``, ``HEAD``, ``OPTIONS``.

For more information, check the usage of the ``methods`` init parameter for https://github.com/eBay/cors-filter[EBay CORSFilter].


|
[[causeway.extensions.cors.allowed-origins]]
causeway.extensions.cors. +
allowed-origins

|  *
| Which origins are allowed to make CORS requests.

The default is the wildcard ("*"), meaning any origin is allowed to access the resource, but this can be made more restrictive if necessary using a whitelist of comma separated origins eg:

``org``

For more information, check the usage of the ``origins`` init parameter for https://github.com/eBay/cors-filter[EBay CORSFilter].


|
[[causeway.extensions.cors.exposed-headers]]
causeway.extensions.cors. +
exposed-headers

|  Authorization
| Which HTTP headers are exposed in a CORS request.

A comma separated list of headers other than the simple response headers that browsers are allowed to access. These are the headers which will also be included as part of 'Access-Control-Expose-Headers' header in the pre-flight response.

Default is none.

For more information, check the usage of the ``headers`` init parameter for https://github.com/eBay/cors-filter[EBay CORSFilter].


|
[[causeway.extensions.execution-log.persist]]
causeway.extensions.execution-log. +
persist

| 
| Whether the ``ExecutionSubscriber`` implementation provided by this extension (which persists executions to the execution log) is enabled or not.

One reason to use this option is if you wish to provide your own implementation that wraps or delegates to the default implementation of ``ExecutionSubscriber`` that is provided by the _executionLog_ extension. Because executions are published to _all_ subscribers on the class path, you can disable the default implementation from doing anything using this setting.


|
[[causeway.extensions.execution-outbox.persist]]
causeway.extensions. +
execution-outbox.persist

| 
| Whether the ``ExecutionSubscriber`` implementation provided by this extension (which persists executions to the outbox) is enabled or not.

One reason to use this option is if you wish to provide your own implementation that wraps or delegates to the outbox implementation of ``ExecutionSubscriber`` that is provided by the _executionOutbox_ extension. Because executions are published to _all_ subscribers on the class path, you can disable the outbox implementation from doing anything using this setting.


|
[[causeway.extensions.execution-outbox.rest-api.max-pending]]
causeway.extensions. +
execution-outbox.rest-api. +
max-pending

|  100
| The maximum number of interactions that will be returned when the REST API is polled.

|
[[causeway.extensions.secman.delegated-users.auto-create-policy]]
causeway.extensions.secman. +
delegated-users.auto-create-policy

| 
| Whether delegated users should be autocreated as locked (the default) or unlocked.

BE AWARE THAT if any users are auto-created as unlocked, then the set of roles that they are given should be highly restricted !!!

NOTE also that this configuration policy is ignored if running secman with Spring OAuth2 or Keycloak as the authenticator; users are always auto-created.


|
[[causeway.extensions.secman.delegated-users.initial-role-names]]
causeway.extensions.secman. +
delegated-users.initial-role-names

| 
| The set of roles that users that have been automatically created are granted automatically.

Typically the regular user role (as per ``role-name``, default value of ``causeway-ext-secman-user``) will be one of the roles listed here, to provide the ability for the end-user to logout, among other things (!).


|
[[causeway.extensions.secman.fixture-scripts.abstract-role-and-permissions-fixture-script.unknown-feature-id-checking-policy]]
causeway.extensions.secman. +

[[causeway.extensions.secman.seed.admin.namespace-permissions.additional]]
causeway.extensions.secman.seed. +
admin.namespace-permissions. +
additional

| 
| An (optional) additional set of namespaces that the role is granted.

These are in addition to the main namespaces granted.

@see NamespacePermissions#getSticky()


|
[[causeway.extensions.secman.seed.admin.namespace-permissions.sticky]]
causeway.extensions.secman.seed. +
admin.namespace-permissions.sticky

| 
| The set of namespaces to which the role is granted.

These namespaces are intended to be sufficient to allow users with this admin role to be able to administer the security module itself, for example to manage users and roles. The security user is not necessarily able to use the main business logic within the domain application itself, though.

These roles cannot be removed via user interface

WARNING: normally these should not be overridden. Instead, specify additional namespaces using ``NamespacePermissions#getAdditional()``.

@see NamespacePermissions#getAdditional()


|
[[causeway.extensions.secman.seed.admin.password]]
causeway.extensions.secman.seed. +
admin.password

| 
| The corresponding password for user. @see #getUserName()


|
[[causeway.extensions.secman.seed.admin.role-name]]
causeway.extensions.secman.seed. +
admin.role-name

| 
| The name of security admin role.

Users with this role (in particular, the default user are granted access to a set of namespaces (``NamespacePermissions#getSticky()`` and ``NamespacePermissions#getAdditional()``) which are intended to be sufficient to allow users with this admin role to be able to administer the security module itself, for example to manage users and roles.

@see Admin#getUserName() @see NamespacePermissions#getSticky() @see NamespacePermissions#getAdditional()


|
[[causeway.extensions.secman.seed.admin.user-name]]
causeway.extensions.secman.seed. +
admin.user-name

| 
| The name of the security super user.

This user is automatically made a member of the role, from which it is granted permissions to administer other users.

The password for this user is set in ``Admin#getPassword()``.

@see #getPassword() @see #getRoleName()


|
[[causeway.extensions.secman.seed.regular-user.role-name]]
causeway.extensions.secman.seed. +
regular-user.role-name

| 
| The role name for regular users of the application, granting them access to basic security features.

The exact set of permissions is hard-wired in the ``CausewayExtSecmanRegularUserRoleAndPermissions`` fixture.


|
[[causeway.extensions.secman.seed.yaml-file]]
causeway.extensions.secman.seed. +
yaml-file

| 
| Path to local YAML file, if present, to use as an alternative seeding strategy.

Eg. seed from a YAML file, that was previously exported by SecMan's ApplicationRoleManager_exportAsYaml mixin.


|
[[causeway.extensions.secman.user-menu-me-action-policy]]
causeway.extensions.secman. +
user-menu-me-action-policy

| 
| Whether the presence of SecMan should result in the automatic suppression of the ``UserMenu``'s ``me#act() me()`` action.

This is normally what is required as SecMan's ``ApplicationUser`` is a more comprehensive representation of the current user. If the default ``me#act() me()`` action is not suppressed, then the end-user will see two actions with the name "me" in the tertiary menu.


|
[[causeway.extensions.secman.user-registration.initial-role-names]]
causeway.extensions.secman. +
user-registration. +
initial-role-names

| 
| The set of roles that users registering with the app are granted automatically.

[[causeway.extensions.titlecache.caffeine.expiry-duration-in-minutes]]
causeway.extensions.titlecache. +
caffeine. +
expiry-duration-in-minutes

|  20
| Default duration that entries remain in the cache (for a given logical type name), in minutes.

Default is 20 mins.


|
[[causeway.extensions.titlecache.caffeine.max-size-in-entries]]
causeway.extensions.titlecache. +
caffeine.max-size-in-entries

|  1000
