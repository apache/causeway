| Provides a mapping of patterns to font-awesome CSS classes, where the pattern is used to match against the name of the action method in order to determine a CSS class to use, for example on the action's menu icon if rendered by the Wicket viewer.

Providing a default set of patterns encourages a common set of verbs to be used.

The font awesome class for individual actions can be overridden using ``ActionLayout#cssClassFa()``.

|
[[causeway.applib.annotation.action.command-publishing]]
causeway.applib.annotation.action. +
command-publishing

| 
| The default for whether action invocations should be reified as a ``Command``, to be sent to any registered ``CommandSubscriber``s, typically for auditing purposes.

This setting can be overridden on a case-by-case basis using ``Action#commandPublishing()``.


|
[[causeway.applib.annotation.action.domain-event.post-for-default]]
causeway.applib.annotation.action. +
domain-event.post-for-default

|  true
| Influences whether an ``ActionDomainEvent`` should be published (on the internal ``EventBusService``) whenever an action is being interacted with.

Up to five different events can be fired during an interaction, with the event's phase determining which (hide, disable, validate, executing and executed). Subscribers can influence the behaviour at each of these phases.

The algorithm for determining whether (and what type of) an event is actually sent depends on the value of the ``Action#domainEvent()`` for the action in question

* If set to some subtype of ActionDomainEvent.Noop, then _no_ event is sent.
* If set to some subtype of ActionDomainEvent.Default, then an event is sent _if and only if_ this configuration setting is set.
* If set to any other subtype, then an event _is_ sent.


|
[[causeway.applib.annotation.action.execution-publishing]]
causeway.applib.annotation.action. +
execution-publishing

| 
| The default for whether action invocations should be sent through to the ``ExecutionSubscriber`` for publishing.

The service's onExecution method is called only once per transaction, with ``Execution`` collecting details of the identity of the target object, the action invoked, the action arguments and the returned object (if any).

This setting can be overridden on a case-by-case basis using ``Action#executionPublishing() Action#executionPublishing()``.


|
[[causeway.applib.annotation.collection-layout.default-view]]
causeway.applib.annotation. +
collection-layout.default-view

| 
| Defines the initial view to display collections when rendered.

The value of this can be overridden on a case-by-case basis using ``CollectionLayout#defaultView()``. Note that this default configuration property is an enum and so defines only a fixed number of values, whereas the annotation returns a string; this is to allow for flexibility that individual viewers might support their own additional types. For example, the Wicket viewer supports


|
[[causeway.applib.annotation.collection-layout.paged]]
causeway.applib.annotation. +
collection-layout.paged

|  12
| Defines the default number of objects that are shown in a "parented" collection of a domain object, result of invoking an action.

This can be overridden on a case-by-case basis using ``CollectionLayout#paged()``.


|
[[causeway.applib.annotation.collection-layout.sequence-policy-if-unreferenced]]
causeway.applib.annotation. +
collection-layout. +
sequence-policy-if-unreferenced

| 
| How ``CollectionLayout#sequence()`` should be handled when calculating the slot-in order for unreferenced _Collections_. \{@code AS_PER_SEQUENCE} will use Dewey order based on available 'sequence' attributes, whereas \{@code ALPHABETICALLY} will use alphabetical order based on member names.

default: \{@code AS_PER_SEQUENCE}


|
[[causeway.applib.annotation.collection-layout.table-decorator]]
causeway.applib.annotation. +
collection-layout.table-decorator

| 
| Defines whether the table representation of a collection should be decorated using a client-side Javascript library, eg for client-side paging and filtering.


|
[[causeway.applib.annotation.collection.domain-event.post-for-default]]
causeway.applib.annotation. +
collection.domain-event. +
post-for-default

|  true
| Influences whether an ``CollectionDomainEvent`` should be published (on the internal ``EventBusService``) whenever a collection is being interacted with.

Up to two different events can be fired during an interaction, with the event's phase determining which (hide, disable)Subscribers can influence the behaviour at each of these phases.

The algorithm for determining whether (and what type of) an event is actually sent depends on the value of the ``Collection#domainEvent()`` for the collection action in question:

* If set to some subtype of CollectionDomainEvent.Noop, then _no_ event is sent.
* If set to some subtype of CollectionDomainEvent.Default, then an event is sent _if and only if_ this configuration setting is set.
* If set to any other subtype, then an event _is_ sent.

causeway.applib.annotation. +
domain-object-layout. +
css-class-ui-event. +
post-for-default

| 
| Influences whether an ``CssClassUiEvent`` should be published (on the internal ``EventBusService``) whenever a domain object is about to be rendered in the UI - thereby allowing subscribers to optionally ``CssClassUiEvent#setCssClass(String)`` change) the CSS classes that are used.

The algorithm for determining whether (and what type of) an event is sent depends on the value of the ``DomainObjectLayout#cssClassUiEvent()`` @DomainObjectLayout(cssClassEvent=...)} for the domain object in question.

* If set to some subtype of CssClassUiEvent.Noop, then _no_ event is sent.
* If set to some subtype of CssClassUiEvent.Default, then an event is sent _if and only if_ this configuration setting is set.
* If set to any other subtype, then an event _is_ sent.

The default is ``false``, because otherwise the mere presence of ``@DomainObjectLayout`` (perhaps for some attribute other than this one) will cause any imperative ``cssClass()`` method to be ignored.


|
[[causeway.applib.annotation.domain-object-layout.icon-ui-event.post-for-default]]
causeway.applib.annotation. +
domain-object-layout.icon-ui-event. +
post-for-default

| 
| Influences whether an ``IconUiEvent`` should be published (on the internal ``EventBusService``) whenever a domain object is about to be rendered in the UI - thereby allowing subscribers to optionally ``IconUiEvent#setIconName(String)`` change) the icon that is used.

The algorithm for determining whether (and what type of) an event is sent depends on the value of the ``DomainObjectLayout#iconUiEvent()`` @DomainObjectLayout(iconEvent=...)} for the domain object in question.

* If set to some subtype of IconUiEvent.Noop, then _no_ event is sent.
* If set to some subtype of IconUiEvent.Default, then an event is sent _if and only if_ this configuration setting is set.
* If set to any other subtype, then an event _is_ sent.

The default is ``false``, because otherwise the mere presence of ``@DomainObjectLayout`` (perhaps for some attribute other than this one) will cause any imperative ``iconName()`` method to be ignored.

causeway.applib.annotation. +
domain-object-layout. +
layout-ui-event.post-for-default

| 
| Influences whether an ``LayoutUiEvent`` should be published (on the internal ``EventBusService``) whenever a domain object is about to be rendered in the UI - thereby allowing subscribers to optionally ``LayoutUiEvent#setLayout(String)`` change) the layout that is used.

If a different layout value has been set, then a layout in the form ``xml`` use used (where ``zzz`` is the name of the layout).

The algorithm for determining whether (and what type of) an event is sent depends on the value of the ``DomainObjectLayout#layoutUiEvent()`` @DomainObjectLayout(layoutEvent=...)} for the domain object in question.

* If set to some subtype of LayoutUiEvent.Noop, then _no_ event is sent.
* If set to some subtype of LayoutUiEvent.Default, then an event is sent _if and only if_ this configuration setting is set.
* If set to any other subtype, then an event _is_ sent.

The default is ``false``, because otherwise the mere presence of ``@DomainObjectLayout`` (perhaps for some attribute other than this one) will cause any imperative ``layout()`` method to be ignored.

[[causeway.applib.annotation.domain-object-layout.paged]]
causeway.applib.annotation. +
domain-object-layout.paged

|  25
| Defines the default number of objects that are shown in a "standalone" collection obtained as the result of invoking an action.

This can be overridden on a case-by-case basis using ``DomainObjectLayout#paged()``.


|
[[causeway.applib.annotation.domain-object-layout.table-decorator]]
causeway.applib.annotation. +
domain-object-layout. +
table-decorator

| 
| Defines whether the table representation of a standalone collection of this domain class should be decorated using a client-side Javascript library, eg for client-side paging and filtering.

causeway.applib.annotation. +
domain-object-layout. +
title-ui-event.post-for-default

| 
| Influences whether an ``TitleUiEvent`` should be published (on the internal ``EventBusService``) whenever a domain object is about to be rendered in the UI - thereby allowing subscribers to optionally ``TitleUiEvent#setTitle(String)`` change) the title that is used.

The algorithm for determining whether (and what type of) an event is sent depends on the value of the ``DomainObjectLayout#titleUiEvent()`` @DomainObjectLayout(titleEvent=...)} for the domain object in question.

* If set to some subtype of TitleUiEvent.Noop, then _no_ event is sent.
* If set to some subtype of TitleUiEvent.Default, then an event is sent _if and only if_ this configuration setting is set.
* If set to any other subtype, then an event _is_ sent.

The default is ``false``, because otherwise the mere presence of ``@DomainObjectLayout`` (perhaps for some attribute other than this one) will cause any imperative ``title()`` method to be ignored.

causeway.applib.annotation. +
domain-object. +
created-lifecycle-event. +
post-for-default

|  true
| Influences whether an ``ObjectCreatedEvent`` should be published (on the internal ``EventBusService``) whenever a domain object has been created using ``FactoryService``.

The algorithm for determining whether (and what type of) an event is sent depends on the value of the ``DomainObject#createdLifecycleEvent() @DomainObject(createdLifecycleEvent=...)`` for the domain object in question.

* If set to some subtype of ObjectCreatedEvent.Noop, then _no_ event is sent.
* If set to some subtype of ObjectCreatedEvent.Default, then an event is sent _if and only if_ this configuration setting is set.
* If set to any other subtype, then an event _is_ sent.


|
[[causeway.applib.annotation.domain-object.editing]]
causeway.applib.annotation. +
domain-object.editing

| 
| The default for whether the properties of domain objects can be edited, or whether instead they can be modified only using actions (or programmatically as a side-effect of actions on other objects).

This setting can be overridden on a case-by-case basis using ``DomainObject#getEditing() DomainObject#getEditing()``


|
[[causeway.applib.annotation.domain-object.entity-change-publishing]]
causeway.applib.annotation. +
domain-object. +
entity-change-publishing

| 
| The default for whether _domain entities_ should be audited or not (meaning that any changes are sent through to ``EntityChangesSubscriber``s and sent through to ``EntityPropertyChangeSubscriber``.

This setting can be overridden on a case-by-case basis using ``DomainObject#entityChangePublishing()``

Note: this applies only to domain entities, not view models.

causeway.applib.annotation. +
domain-object. +
loaded-lifecycle-event. +
post-for-default

causeway.applib.annotation. +
domain-object. +
persisted-lifecycle-event. +
post-for-default

|  true
| Influences whether an ``ObjectPersistedEvent`` should be published (on the internal ``EventBusService``) whenever a domain _entity_ has been persisted (for the first time) to the persistence store.

The algorithm for determining whether (and what type of) an event is sent depends on the value of the ``DomainObject#persistedLifecycleEvent() @DomainObject(persistedLifecycleEvent=...)`` for the domain object in question.

* If set to some subtype of ObjectPersistedEvent.Noop, then _no_ event is sent.
* If set to some subtype of ObjectCreatedEvent.Default, then an event is sent _if and only if_ this configuration setting is set.

causeway.applib.annotation. +
domain-object. +
removing-lifecycle-event. +
post-for-default

|  true
| Influences whether an ``ObjectRemovingEvent`` should be published (on the internal ``EventBusService``) whenever a persistent domain _entity_ is about to be removed (that is, deleted) from the persistence store.

The algorithm for determining whether (and what type of) an event is sent depends on the value of the ``DomainObject#removingLifecycleEvent() @DomainObject(removingLifecycleEvent=...)`` for the domain object in question.

* If set to some subtype of ObjectRemovingEvent.Noop, then _no_ event is sent.
* If set to some subtype of ObjectCreatedEvent.Default, then an event is sent _if and only if_ this configuration setting is set.
* If set to any other subtype, then an event _is_ sent.

Note: this applies only to domain entities, not to view models.

Note: There is no corresponding ``removed`` callback, because (for the JDO persistence store at least) it is not possible to interact with a domain entity once it has been deleted.

* If set to some subtype of LayoutUiEvent.Default, then an event is sent _if and only if_ this configuration setting is set.
* If set to any other subtype, then an event _is_ sent.

| Influences whether an ``TitleUiEvent`` should be published (on the internal ``EventBusService``) whenever a view model (annotated with @DomainObject#nature of ``Nature#VIEW_MODEL``) is about to be rendered in the UI - thereby allowing subscribers to optionally ``TitleUiEvent#setTitle(String)`` change) the title that is used.
