[[causeway.prototyping.h2-console.generate-random-web-admin-password]]
causeway.prototyping.h2-console. +
generate-random-web-admin-password

|  true
| Whether to generate a random password for access to the H2 Web-Console advanced features.

If a password is generated, it is logged to the logging subsystem (Log4j2).

Recommended (``true``) when ``#isWebAllowRemoteAccess()`` is also ``true``.


|
[[causeway.prototyping.h2-console.web-allow-remote-access]]
causeway.prototyping.h2-console. +
web-allow-remote-access

| 
| Whether to allow remote access to the H2 Web-Console, which is a potential security risk when no web-admin password is set.

Corresponds to Spring Boot 'spring.h2.console.settings.web-allow-others'.


|
[[causeway.schema.command.param-identifier-strategy]]
causeway.schema.command. +
param-identifier-strategy

| 
| Whether the ``ParamDto#getName()`` field - which uniquely identifies a parameter within the action's of parameters - is populated with the parameter's formal Id (eg "firstName") or instead using the parameter's friendly name (eg "First Name").

The default is to use the Id, but the name is provided as an alternative for compatibility with v1. Note that the name is potentially translated, so this could also cause issues within integration scenarios.


|
[[causeway.security.actions-with-safe-semantics-require-only-viewing-permission]]
causeway.security. +
actions-with-safe-semantics- +
require-only-viewing-permission

| 
| If set, allows _Actions_ with SAFE Semantics to be invoked with only VIEWING permissions.

default: false @see org.apache.causeway.applib.annotation.Action#semantics() @see SemanticsOf
