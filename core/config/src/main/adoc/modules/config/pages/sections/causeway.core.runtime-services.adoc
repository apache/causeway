|Property
|Default
|Description
|
[[causeway.core.runtime-services.application-features.init]]
causeway.core.runtime-services. +
application-features.init

| 
| Whether the ``ApplicationFeatureRepository`` (or the default implementation of that service, at least) should compute the set of ``ApplicationFeature`` that describe the metamodel eagerly, or lazily.


|
[[causeway.core.runtime-services.email.override.bcc]]
causeway.core.runtime-services. +
email.override.bcc

| 
| Intended for testing purposes only, if set then the requested ``bcc:`` of the email will be ignored, and instead sent to this email address instead.


|
[[causeway.core.runtime-services.email.override.cc]]
causeway.core.runtime-services. +
email.override.cc

| 
| Intended for testing purposes only, if set then the requested ``cc:`` of the email will be ignored, and instead sent to this email address instead.


|
[[causeway.core.runtime-services.email.override.to]]
causeway.core.runtime-services. +
email.override.to

| 
| Intended for testing purposes only, if set then the requested ``to:`` of the email will be ignored, and instead sent to this email address instead.


|
[[causeway.core.runtime-services.email.sender.address]]
causeway.core.runtime-services. +
email.sender.address

| 
| Specifies the email address of the user sending the email.

If the username is not specified, is also used as the username to connect to the SMTP service.

This configuration property is mandatory (for the default implementation of the ``EmailService``, at least).


|
[[causeway.core.runtime-services.email.throw-exception-on-fail]]
causeway.core.runtime-services. +
email.throw-exception-on-fail

|  true
| If an email fails to send, whether to propagate the exception (meaning that potentially the end-user might see the exception), or whether instead to just indicate failure through the return value of the method (``EmailService#send(List, List, List, String, String, DataSource...)`` that's being called.


|
[[causeway.core.runtime-services.exception-recognizer.dae.disable]]
causeway.core.runtime-services. +
exception-recognizer.dae.disable

| 
| Whether the ``ExceptionRecognizer`` implementation for Spring's DataAccessException - which attempts to sanitize any exceptions arising from object stores - should be disabled (meaning that exceptions will potentially propagate as more serious to the end user).


|
[[causeway.core.runtime-services.translation.po.mode]]
causeway.core.runtime-services. +
translation.po.mode

| 
| Specifies the initial mode for obtaining/discovering translations.

There are three modes:

* The default mode of write is appropriate for integration testing or prototyping, meaning that the service records any requests made of it but just returns the string unaltered. This is a good way to discover new strings that require translation.
* The read mode is appropriate for production; the service looks up translations that have previously been captured.
* The disabled performs no translation and simply returns the original string unchanged. Unlike the write mode, it does _not_ keep track of translation requests.


|
[[causeway.core.runtime-services.translation.resource-location]]
causeway.core.runtime-services. +
translation.resource-location

| 
| Specifies the relative resource path to look for translation files.

If \{@code null} uses \{@code servletContext.getResource("/WEB-INF/")}.

Replaces the former Servlet context parameter 'causeway.config.dir';
