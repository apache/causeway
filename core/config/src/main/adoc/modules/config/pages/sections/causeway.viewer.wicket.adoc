prevent-double-click-for-form- +
submit

|  true
| Whether to disable a form submit button after it has been clicked, to prevent users causing an error if they do a double click. This behaviour is enabled by default, but can be disabled using this flag.

| 
| Whether to use a modal dialog for property edits and for actions associated with properties.

This can be overridden on a case-by-case basis using ``@PropertyLayout#promptStyle`` and ``@ActionLayout#promptStyle``.

redirect-even-if-same-object

| 
| Whether to redirect to a new page, even if the object being shown (after an action invocation or a property edit) is the same as the previous page.

|
[[causeway.viewer.wicket.remember-me.cookie-key]]
causeway.viewer.wicket.remember-me. +
cookie-key

|  causewayWicketRememberMe
| If the "remember me" feature is available, specifies the key to hold the encrypted credentials in the cookie.


|
[[causeway.viewer.wicket.remember-me.encryption-key]]
causeway.viewer.wicket.remember-me. +
encryption-key

| 
| If the "remember me" feature is available, optionally specifies an encryption key (a complex string acting as salt to the encryption algorithm) for computing the encrypted credentials.

If not set, then (in production mode) the Wicket viewer will compute a random key each time it is started. This will mean that any credentials stored between sessions will become invalid.

Conversely, if set then (in production mode) then the same salt will be used each time the app is started, meaning that cached credentials can continue to be used across restarts.

In prototype mode this setting is effectively ignored, because the same key will always be provided (either as set, or a fixed literal otherwise).


|
[[causeway.viewer.wicket.remember-me.suppress]]
causeway.viewer.wicket.remember-me. +
suppress

| 
| Whether the sign-in page should have a "remember me" link (the default), or if it should be suppressed.

If "remember me" is available and checked, then the viewer will allow users to login based on encrypted credentials stored in a cookie. An key can optionally be specified.


|
[[causeway.viewer.wicket.replace-disabled-tag-with-readonly-tag]]
causeway.viewer.wicket. +
replace-disabled-tag-with-readonly- +

This behaviour is enabled by default but can be disabled using this flag


|
[[causeway.viewer.wicket.show-footer]]
causeway.viewer.wicket.show-footer

|  true
| Whether to show the footer menu bar.

This is enabled by default.


|
[[causeway.viewer.wicket.strip-wicket-tags]]
causeway.viewer.wicket. +
strip-wicket-tags

|  true
| Whether Wicket tags should be stripped from the markup.

By default this is enabled, in other words Wicket tags are stripped. Please be aware that if tags are _not_ stripped, then this may break CSS rules on some browsers.


|
[[causeway.viewer.wicket.suppress-password-reset]]
causeway.viewer.wicket. +
suppress-password-reset

| 
| Whether to suppress the password reset link on the sign-in page.

Although this is disabled by default (in other words the 'reset password' link is not suppressed), note that in addition the application must provide an implementation of the ``UserRegistrationService`` as well as a configured ``EmailNotificationService`` (same conditions as for the ``#isSuppressSignUp()`` sign-up link).


|
[[causeway.viewer.wicket.suppress-sign-up]]
causeway.viewer.wicket. +
suppress-sign-up

| 
| Whether to suppress the sign-up link on the sign-in page.
