|Property
|Default
|Description
|
[[isis.viewer.restfulobjects.base-uri]]
isis.viewer.restfulobjects. +
base-uri

|
| If left unset (the default), then the RO viewer will use the ``UriInfo`` (injected using ``AsyncContext``) to figure out the base Uri (used to render ``href``s).

This will be correct much of the time, but will almost certainly be wrong if there is a reverse proxy.

If set, eg ``com/``, then this value will be used instead.


|
[[isis.viewer.restfulobjects.honor-ui-hints]]
isis.viewer.restfulobjects. +
honor-ui-hints

|
| Whether to enable the ``x-ro-follow-links`` support, to minimize round trips.

The RO viewer provides the capability for the client to set the optional ``x-ro-follow-links`` query parameter, as described in section 34.4 of the RO spec v1.0. If used, the resultant representation includes the result of following the associated link, but through a server-side "join", somewhat akin to GraphQL.

By default this functionality is disabled, this configuration property enables the feature. If enabled, then the representations returned are non-standard with respect to the RO Spec v1.0.


|
[[isis.viewer.restfulobjects.object-property-values-only]]
isis.viewer.restfulobjects. +
object-property-values-only

|
| When rendering domain objects, if set the representation returned is stripped back to a minimal set, excluding links to actions and collections and with a simplified representation of an object's properties.

This is disabled by default. If enabled, then the representations returned are non-standard with respect to the RO Spec v1.0.


|
[[isis.viewer.restfulobjects.strict-accept-checking]]
isis.viewer.restfulobjects. +
strict-accept-checking

|
| If set, then any unrecognised ``Accept`` headers will result in an HTTP _Not Acceptable_ response code (406).


|
[[isis.viewer.restfulobjects.suppress-described-by-links]]
isis.viewer.restfulobjects. +
suppress-described-by-links

|
| If set, then the representations returned will omit any links to the formal domain-type representations.


|
[[isis.viewer.restfulobjects.suppress-member-disabled-reason]]
isis.viewer.restfulobjects. +
suppress-member-disabled-reason

|
| If set, then - should there be an interaction with an action, property or collection that is disabled - then this will prevent the ``disabledReason`` reason from being added to the returned representation.

This is disabled by default. If enabled, then the representations returned are non-standard with respect to the RO Spec v1.0.


|
[[isis.viewer.restfulobjects.suppress-member-extensions]]
isis.viewer.restfulobjects. +
suppress-member-extensions

|
| If set, then the ``x-isis-format`` key (under ``extensions``) for properties will be suppressed.

This is disabled by default. If enabled, then the representations returned are non-standard with respect to the RO Spec v1.0.


|
[[isis.viewer.restfulobjects.suppress-member-id]]
isis.viewer.restfulobjects. +
suppress-member-id

|
| If set, then the ``id`` key for all members will be suppressed.

This is disabled by default. If enabled, then the representations returned are non-standard with respect to the RO Spec v1.0.


|
[[isis.viewer.restfulobjects.suppress-member-links]]
isis.viewer.restfulobjects. +
suppress-member-links

|
| If set, then the detail link (in other words ``]``) for all members will be suppressed.

This is disabled by default. If enabled, then the representations returned are non-standard with respect to the RO Spec v1.0.


|
[[isis.viewer.restfulobjects.suppress-update-link]]
isis.viewer.restfulobjects. +
suppress-update-link

|
| If set, then the update link (in other words `` ]`` to perform a bulk update of an object) will be suppressed.

This is disabled by default. If enabled, then the representations returned are non-standard with respect to the RO Spec v1.0.
