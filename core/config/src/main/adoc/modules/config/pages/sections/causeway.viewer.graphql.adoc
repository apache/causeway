| 
| How resources (``Blob`` bytes, ``Clob`` chars, grids and icons) can be downloaded from the resource controller.

|
[[causeway.viewer.graphql.schema.rich.enable-scenario-testing]]
causeway.viewer.graphql.schema. +
rich.enable-scenario-testing

| 
| If the ``#getSchemaStyle()`` is set to either ``SchemaStyle#RICH_ONLY`` or ``SchemaStyle#SIMPLE_AND_RICH``, then determines whether the "Scenario" field is included in order to allow given/when/then tests to be expressed.
