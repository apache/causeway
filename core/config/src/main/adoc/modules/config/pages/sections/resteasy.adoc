[[resteasy.jaxrs.app.registration]]
resteasy.jaxrs.app.registration

| 
| How the implementation of the JAX-RS application is discovered.

There should be very little reason to change this from its default.

@see https://github.com/resteasy/resteasy-spring-boot/blob/master/mds/USAGE.md[resteasy-spring-boot-starter docs]

[[resteasy.jaxrs.default-path]]
resteasy.jaxrs.default-path

|  /restful
| The path at which the RO viewer should be mounted.

Note that this is used rather than ``prefix`` because there is _NO_ implementation of ``Application``, so we rely on it being automatically created.

@see https://github.com/resteasy/resteasy-spring-boot/blob/master/mds/USAGE.md[resteasy-spring-boot-starter docs]
