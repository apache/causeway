Isis' Wicket viewer has an About page that, by default, will provide a dump of the JARs that make up the webapp.
This page will also show the manifest attributes of the WAR archive itself, if there are any.
One of these attributes may also be used as the application version number.


== Screenshot

Here's what the About page looks like with this configuration added:

image::about-page/about-page.png[width="800px",link="{imagesdir}/about-page/about-page.png"]

[NOTE]
====
Note that this screenshot shows an earlier version of the xref:vw:ROOT:about.adoc[Wicket viewer] UI (specifically, pre 1.8.0).
====

Note that the `Build-Time` attribute has been used as the version number.
The Wicket viewer is hard-coded to search for specific attributes and use as the application version.
In order, it searches for:

* `Implementation-Version`
* `Build-Time`

If none of these are found, then no version is displayed.


== Configuration

=== Adding attributes to the WAR's manifest

Add the following to the webapp's `pom.xml` (under `<build>/<plugins>`):

[source,xml]

                <Build-Label>${project.version}</Build-Label>
            </manifestEntries>
        </archive>
    </configuration>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <phase>package</phase>
            <goals>
                <goal>war</goal>
            </goals>
            <configuration>
                <classifier>${env}</classifier>
            </configuration>
        </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin>
----

If you then build the webapp from the Maven command line (`mvn clean package`), then the WAR should contain a `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF` with those various attribute entries.
This will be picked up automatically and used in the about page.
