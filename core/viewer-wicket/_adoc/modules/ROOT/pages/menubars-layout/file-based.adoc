The domain service actions can be arranged across menu items using the `menubars.layout.xml` file.
Not only is this easier to work with, it also can be reloaded dynamically (if in prototype mode), substantially reducing the edit compile run cycle.

As for xref:vw:ROOT:layout/file-based.adoc[file-based object layouts], this offers a number of benefits:

* Probably most significantly, the layout can be updated without requiring a recompile of the code and redeploy of the app; fine-tuning the layout with your end users is easy to do

* Many developers also find it easier to rationalize about menu bars layout when all the hints are collated together in a single place (rather than scattered across the domain service classes as annotations).

There are some disadvantages to using file-based layouts:

* file-based layouts are not typesafe: a typo will result in the metadata not being picked up for the element.

* they also suffer from syntactic fragility: an invalid XML document will result in no metadata for the entire class.

The `menubars.layout.xml` file is just the serialized form of a xref:applib:cms:classes/layout.adoc[`MenuBars`] layout class defined within Apache Isis' applib.
These are JAXB-annotated classes with corresponding XSD schemas; the upshot of that
is that IDEs such as IntelliJ and Eclipse can provide "intellisense", making it easy to author such layout files.


== Obtaining an initial layout

An initial `menubars.layout.xml` - capturing any existing metadata either implicit or explicitly specified through annotations can be downloaded from the xref:applib:svc:metadata-api/MenuBarsService.adoc[`MenuBarsService`] (exposed on the prototyping menu):

image::/menubars/010-download.png[width="300px",link="{imagesdir}/menubars/010-download.png"]


This action allows either the "Default" or the "Fallback" layout to be downloaded.

image::/menubars/020-download.png[width="400px",link="{imagesdir}/menubars/020-download.png"]

The "Default" layout is that currently in use, while the "Fallback" layout is that provided only from the annotations.
Initially these are identical.

For example, here's a fragment of that provided by the simpleapp archetype:

[source,xml]

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<mb3:menuBars
    xsi:schemaLocation="..."
    xmlns:cpt="http://isis.apache.org/applib/layout/component"
    xmlns:lnk="http://isis.apache.org/applib/layout/links"
    xmlns:mb3="http://isis.apache.org/applib/layout/menubars/bootstrap3"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
    <mb3:primary>

            <mb3:section>
                <mb3:serviceAction objectType="simple.SimpleObjectMenu" id="listAll">
                    <cpt:named>List All</cpt:named>
                </mb3:serviceAction>
                <mb3:serviceAction objectType="simple.SimpleObjectMenu" id="findByName">

                </mb3:serviceAction>
                <mb3:serviceAction objectType="simple.SimpleObjectMenu" id="create">
                    <cpt:named>Create</cpt:named>
                </mb3:serviceAction>
            </mb3:section>
        </mb3:menu>
        <mb3:menu unreferencedActions="true">
            <mb3:named>Other</mb3:named>
        </mb3:menu>
    </mb3:primary>
    <mb3:secondary>
        <mb3:menu>
            <mb3:named>Prototyping</mb3:named>
            ...
    </mb3:secondary>
    <mb3:tertiary>
        <mb3:menu>
            ...
        </mb3:menu>
    </mb3:tertiary>
</mb3:menuBars>
----

Note the "Other" menu, with `unreferencedActions` attribute set to `true`.
For a layout file to be valid there must be exactly one `<menu>` with this attribute set.
Any domain service actions that are not explicitly listed will be placed under this menu.


== Adjusting the layout

The downloaded `menubars.layout.xml` file can be adjusted as necessary, creating new menus and menu sections.
Once done, it can be saved in the same package as the `AppManifest` used to bootstrap the application.
Subsequently, the file is then parsed and used when the application is started.

If running in prototype mode, the file will be dynamically reloaded from the classpath.

Once the application has bootstrapped with a layout file, downloading the "Default" layout (from the prototyping menu) in essence just returns this file.

[TIP]
====
If, when the application is run, unwanted service actions are shown in the "Other" menu (which you would like to place elsewhere), then download the "Default" layout again.
The downloaded file will list out all these domain service actions, so that they can easily be moved elsewhere.
