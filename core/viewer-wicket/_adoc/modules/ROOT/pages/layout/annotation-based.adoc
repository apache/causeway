Metadata providing UI hints can be specified either using annotations, or using a xref:vw:ROOT:layout/file-based.adoc[`layout.xml`] file.

In most cases you will probably want to use the file-based approach: changes to file layouts are picked up dynamically, and using a file also allows tabs and tab groups to be specified: this is not supported using annotations.

Nevertheless, annotations are still supported and are sometimes useful for very simple objects or just when prototyping.
This section explains how.


== `@MemberOrder`

The xref:applib:ant:MemberOrder.adoc[`@MemberOrder`]  annotation is used to specify the relative order of domain class properties, collections and actions.

The annotation defines two attributes, xref:applib:ant:MemberOrder.adoc#name[`name()`] and xref:applib:ant:MemberOrder.adoc#sequence[`sequence()`].
Their usage depends on the member type:

* for properties, the `name()` is used to group properties together into a member group (also called a property group or a fieldset.
The `sequence()` then orders properties within these groups.
If no `name()` is specified then the property is placed in a fallback "General" group, called "General".
+
The name of these member groups/fieldsets are then referenced by xref:applib:ant:MemberGroupLayout.adoc[`@MemberGroupLayout`].

* for collections, the `name()` attribute is (currently) unused.
The `sequence()` orders collections relative to one another

* for actions, the `name()` attribute associates an action with either a property or with a collection.

** If the `name()` attribute matches a property name, then the action's button is rendered close to the property, according to xref:applib:ant:ActionLayout.adoc#position[`@ActionLayout#position()`] attribute.

** On the other hand if the `name() attribute matches a collection name, then the action's button is rendered on the collection's header.

** If there is no `name()` value, then the action is considered to pertain to the object as a whole, and its button is rendered close to the object's icon and title.

Within any of these, the `sequence()` then determines the relative ordering of the action with respect to other actions that have been similarly associated with properties/collections or left as "free-standing".



For example:

[source,java]
----
public class ToDoItem {
    @MemberOrder(sequence="1")
    public String getDescription() { /* ... */ }
    @MemberOrder(sequence="2")
    public String getCategory() { /* ... */ }
    @MemberOrder(sequence="3")
    public boolean isComplete() { /* ... */ }
    @MemberOrder(name="Detail", sequence="1")
    public LocalDate getDueBy() { /* ... */ }
    @MemberOrder(name="Detail", sequence="2")
    public BigDecimal getCost() { /* ... */ }
    @MemberOrder(name="Detail", sequence="4")
    public String getNotes() { /* ... */ }
    @MemberOrder(name="Misc", sequence="99")
    public Long getVersionSequence() { /* ... */ }
    // ...
}
----

This defines three property (or member) groups, "General", "Detail" and "Misc"; "General" is the default if no `name` attribute is specified.
Properties in the same member group are rendered together, as a fieldset.

In addition, actions can optionally be associated (rendered close to) either properties or actions.
This is done by overloading the ``@MemberOrder``'s xref:applib:ant:MemberOrder.adoc#name[`name()`] attribute, holding the value of the property or collection.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class ToDoItem {
    @MemberOrder(sequence="3")
    public boolean isComplete() { /* ... */ }
    @MemberOrder(name="complete", sequence="1")
    public ToDoItem completed() { /* ... */ }
    @MemberOrder(name="complete", sequence="2")
    public ToDoItem notYetCompleted() { /* ... */ }

    @MemberOrder(sequence="1")
    public SortedSet<ToDoItem> getDependencies() { /* ... */ }
    @MemberOrder(name="dependencies", sequence="1")
    public ToDoItem add(ToDoItem t) { /* ... */ }
    @MemberOrder(name="dependencies", sequence="2")
    public ToDoItem remove(ToDoItem t) { /* ... */ }
    // ...
}
----

will associate the `completed()` and `notYetCompleted()` actions with the `complete` property, and will associate the `add()` and `remove()` actions with the `dependencies` collection.


The value of xref:applib:ant:MemberOrder.adoc#sequence[`sequence()`] is a string.
The simplest convention (as shown in the example above) is to use numbers -- 1, 2, 3 -- though it is a better idea to leave gaps in the numbers -- 10, 20, 30 perhaps -- such that a new member may be added without having to edit existing numbers.

Even better is to adopt the 'dewey-decimal' notation -- 1, 1.1, 1.2, 2, 3, 5.1.1, 5.2.2, 5.2, 5.3 -- which allows for an indefinite amount of future insertion.
It also allows subclasses to insert their class members as required.




== `@MemberGroupLayout`

The xref:applib:ant:MemberGroupLayout.adoc[`@MemberGroupLayout`] annotation specifies the relative positioning of property groups/fieldsets as being either in a left column, a middle column or in a right column.
The annotation also specifies the relative width of the columns.

The property groups/fieldsets in this case are those that are inferred from the `@MemberOrder#name()` attribute.

[TIP]
====
It is also possible to combine `@MemberOrder` with a xref:vw:ROOT:layout/file-based.adoc[file-based layout].
The layout file defines only the regions of a grid structure (fieldsets/columns etc), but does __not__ specify the properties/collections/actions within those grid regions.
The `@MemberOrder` annotation in effect "binds" the properties or collections to those regions of the grid.

When file-based layouts are used this way, the xref:applib:ant:MemberGroupLayout.adoc[`@MemberGroupLayout`] annotation is essentially ignored, but the metadata from the xref:applib:ant:MemberOrder.adoc[`@MemberOrder`] annotation (and the other layout annotations, xref:applib:ant:ActionLayout.adoc[`@ActionLayout`], xref:applib:ant:PropertyLayout.adoc[`@PropertyLayout`] and xref:applib:ant:CollectionLayout.adoc[`@CollectionLayout`]) are all still honoured.
====

For example:

[source,java]
----
@MemberGroupLayout(
     columnSpans={3,3,0,6},
     left={"General", "Misc"},
     middle="Detail"
 )
public class ToDoItem {
    // ...
}
----

Four values are given in the `columnSpans` attribute.
The first three are the relative widths of the three columns of property groups.
The fourth, meanwhile, indicates the width of a final column that holds all the collections of the object.

The values of these spans are taken as proportions of 12 virtual columns across the page (this taken from the link:http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/[Bootstrap] library).

For example:

* `{3,3,0,6}` indicates:
** a left column of properties taking up 25% of the width
** a middle column of properties taking up 25% of the width
** a right column of collections taking up 50% of the width
* `{2,6,0,4}` indicates:
** a left column of properties taking up ~16% of the width
** a middle column of properties taking up 50% of the width
** a right column of collections taking up ~33% of the width
* `{2,3,3,4}` indicates:
** a left column of properties taking up ~16% of the width
** a middle column of properties taking up 25% of the width
** a right column of properties taking up 25% of the width
** a far right column of collections taking up ~33% of the width

If the sum of all the columns exceeds 12, then the collections are placed underneath the properties, taking up the full span. For example:

* {4,4,4,12} indicates:
** a left column of properties taking up ~33% of the width
** a middle column of properties taking up ~33% of the width
** a right column of properties taking up ~33% of the width
** the collections underneath the property columns, taking up the full width

== Example Layouts

Below are sketches for the layout of the https://github.com/apache/isis/blob/f38fdb92941172eabb12e0943509f239e6d5925f/example/application/quickstart_wicket_restful_jdo/dom/src/main/java/dom/todo/ToDoItem.java[ToDoItem] class of the Isis addons example https://github.com/isisaddons/isis-app-todoapp/[todoapp] (not ASF):

The first divides the properties into two equal sized columns (6-6-0) and puts the collections underneath (12):

image::reference-layout/6-6-0-12.png[width="720px",link="{imagesdir}/reference-layout/6-6-0-12.png"]

The next divides the collections into three equal sized columns (4-4-4) and again puts the collections underneath (12):

image::reference-layout/4-4-4-12.png[width="720px",link="{imagesdir}/reference-layout/4-4-4-12.png"]

The last puts the properties into a single column (4-0) and places the collections into the other larger column (8-0):

image::reference-layout/4-0-8-0.png[width="720px",link="{imagesdir}/reference-layout/4-0-8-0.png"]
