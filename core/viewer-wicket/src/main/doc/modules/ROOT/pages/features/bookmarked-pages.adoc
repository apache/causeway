The Wicket viewer supports the bookmarking of both domain objects and query-only (xref:refguide:applib-ant:Action.adoc#semantics[@Action(semantics=...)]) actions.

Domain objects, if bookmarkable, can be nested.

Bookmarking is automatic; whenever a bookmarkable object/action is visited, then a bookmark is created. To avoid the number of bookmarks from indefinitely growing, bookmarks that have not been followed after a whle are automatically removed (an MRU/LRU algorithm). The number of bookmarks to preserve can be configured.




== Screenshots

The following screenshot (nb: using a pre 1.8.0 version of the xref:vw:ROOT:about.adoc[Wicket viewer] UI), taken from https://github.com/isisaddons/isis-app-todoapp[Isisaddons example todoapp] (not ASF), shows how the bookmarks are listed in a sliding panel.

Note how the list contains both domain objects and an action ("not yet complete").

Bookmarks can also form a hierarchy.  The following screenshot, also taken from the https://github.com/estatio/estatio[Estatio] application, shows a variety of different bookmarked objects with a nested structure:

image::bookmarked-pages/panel-estatio.png[width="800px",link="{imagesdir}/bookmarked-pages/panel-estatio.png"]

Some - like `Property`, `Lease` and `Party` - are root nodes. However, `LeaseItem` is bookmarkable as a child of `Lease`, and `LeaseTerm` is bookmarkable only as a child of `LeaseItem`. This parent/child relationship is reflected in the layout.




== Domain Code

To indicate a class is bookmarkable, use the xref:refguide:applib-ant:DomainObjectLayout.adoc[@DomainObjectLayout] annotation:

[source,java]
----
@DomainObjectLayout(
    bookmarking=BookmarkPolicy.AS_ROOT
)
public class Lease { /* ... */ }
----

To indicate a class is bookmarkable but only as a child of some parent bookmark, specify the bookmark policy:

[source,java]
----
@DomainObjectLayout(
    bookmarking=BookmarkPolicy.AS_CHILD
)
public class LeaseItem { /* ... */ }
----

To indicate that a safe (query only) action is bookmarkable, use the xref:refguide:applib-ant:ActionLayout.adoc[@ActionLayout] annotation:

[source,java]
----
public class ToDoItem ... {
    @Action(
        semantics=SemanticsOf.SAFE
    )
    @ActionLayout(
         bookmarking=BookmarkPolicy.AS_ROOT
     )
    public List<ToDoItem> notYetComplete() { /* ... */ }
    ...
}
----

[NOTE]
====
The BookmarkPolicy.AS_CHILD does not have a meaning for actions; if the `bookmarking` attribute is set to any other value, it will be ignored.
====




== User Experience

The sliding panel appears whenever the mouse pointer hovers over the thin blue tab (to the left of the top header region).

Alternatively, `alt+[` will toggle open/close the panel; it can also be closed using `Esc` key.


=== Related functionality

The xref:vw:ROOT:features/recent-pages.adoc[Recent Pages] also lists recently visited pages, selected from a drop-down.





== Configuration

By default, the bookmarked pages panel will show a maximum of 15 'root' pages. This can be overridden using a property (in `isis.properties`), for example:

[source,ini]
----
isis.viewer.wicket.bookmarkedPages.maxSize=20
----
