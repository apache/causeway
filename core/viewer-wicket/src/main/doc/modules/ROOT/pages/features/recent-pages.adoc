The Wicket viewer provides a recent pages drop-down that acts as a breadcrumb trail.
Using it, the user can quickly open a recently accessed domain object.



== Screenshots

The following screenshot, taken from the https://github.com/estatio/estatio[Estatio] application, shows the recent pages drop-down after a number of pages have been accessed.

This screenshot is based on v1.7.x of the xref:vw:ROOT:about.adoc[Wicket viewer] UI.

// TODO: v2: update this old screenshot.



== Domain Code

The recent pages drop-down is automatically populated; no changes need to be made to the domain classes.




== User Experience

Selecting the domain object from the list causes the viewer to automatically navigate to the page for the selected object.




== Related functionality

The xref:vw:ROOT:features.adoc#bookmarked-pages[bookmarked pages] (sliding panel) also provides links to recently visited objects, but only those explicitly marked as `@DomainObject(bookmarking=...)`.  The bookmarks panel also nests related objects together hierarchically (the recent pages drop-down does not).




== Configuration

The number of objects is hard-coded as 10; it cannot currently be configured.
