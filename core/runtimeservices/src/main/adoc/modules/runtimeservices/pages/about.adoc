this module provides an extensive set of domain services.

Many of the services defined (as interfaces) in the applib are actually implemented in this module (the rest are defined in xref:core:metamodel:about.adoc[]).


Although it's a simplification, you can think of the xref:core:metamodel:about.adoc[] module as handling domain types (cf `java.lang.Class`), while the xref:core:runtime:about.adoc[], xref:core:runtimeservices:about.adoc[] and xref:transaction:about.adoc[] modules handle domain object instances (cf `java.lang.Object`).

That said, Spring Boot is responsible for instantiating domain service instances, while the xref:pjpa:ROOT:about.adoc[JPA] object store -- which is not part of the `core` modules -- handle the lifecycle of entity instances.
