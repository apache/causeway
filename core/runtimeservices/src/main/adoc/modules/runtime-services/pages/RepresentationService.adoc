WARNING: TODO: this content has not yet been reviewed/updated for v2.0


The `RepresentationService` is the main plug-in point for the xref:vro:ROOT:about.adoc[RestfulObjects viewer] to generate representations.

The default implementations ultimately generate representations according to the link:http://restfulobjects.org[Restful Objects spec] v1.0.
However, it also delegates to the xref:core:runtime-services:ContentNegotiationService.adoc[`ContentNegotiationService`] which provides a mechanism for altering representations according to the HTTP `Accept` header.
This allows more flexible representations to be generated for REST clients that (perhaps through their use of a certain Javascript library, say) expect, or at least works best with, a certain style of representation.

In all there are three domain services that can influence the representations generated: this service, xref:core:runtime-services:ContentNegotiationService.adoc[`ContentNegotiationService`] and the xref:refguide:applib-svc:ContentMappingService.adoc[`ContentMappingService`].
The diagram below shows how these collaborate:

image::RepresentationService/service-collaborations.png[width="700px"]

The `RepresentationServiceContentNegotiator` is the default implementation of the top-level `RepresentationService`, and it delegates to list of injecting `ContentNegotiationService` services.
Using a chain of responsibility pattern, it returns the first non-null representation.
For their part, the implementations of `ContentNegotiationService` use the HTTP Accept header to determine if they should render any representation or just return null.


== SPI

The SPI defined by this service is:

[source,java]
----
public interface RepresentationService {
    Response objectRepresentation(                  // <1>
            Context rendererContext,
            ObjectAdapter objectAdapter);
    Response propertyDetails(                       // <2>
            Context rendererContext,
            ObjectAndProperty objectAndProperty,
            MemberReprMode memberReprMode);
    Response collectionDetails(                     // <3>
            Context rendererContext,
            ObjectAndCollection objectAndCollection,
            MemberReprMode memberReprMode);
    Response actionPrompt(                          // <4>
            Context rendererContext,
            ObjectAndAction objectAndAction);
    Response actionResult(                          // <5>
            Context rendererContext,
            ObjectAndActionInvocation objectAndActionInvocation,
            ActionResultReprRenderer.SelfLink selfLink);
    public static interface Context extends RendererContext {
        ObjectAdapterLinkTo getAdapterLinkTo();
    }
}
----
<1> representation of a single object, eg as per section 14.4 of the RO spec, v1.0
<2> representation of a single property of an object, eg as per section 16.4 of the RO spec v1.0
<3> representation of a single collection of an object, eg as per section 17.5 of the RO spec v1.0
<4> representation of a single action (prompt) of an object, eg as per section 18.2 of the RO spec v1.0
<5> representation of the results of a single action invocation, eg as per section 19.5 of the RO spec v1.0

These methods provide:

* a `RendererContext` which provides access to request-specific context (eg HTTP headers), session-specific context (eg authentication) and global context (eg configuration settings)

* an object representing the information to be rendered +
+
eg `ObjectAdapter`, `ObjectAndProperty`, `ObjectAndCollection` etc

* for pathsToInclude, whether the representation is in read/write mode +
+
ie `MemberReprMode`






== Implementation

As discussed in the introduction, the framework provides a default implementation, `o.a.i.v.ro.rendering.service.RepresentationServiceContentNegotiator`.
This delegates to xref:core:runtime-services:ContentNegotiationService.adoc[`ContentNegotiationService`] to generate an alternative representation; but if none is provided then it falls back on generating the representations as defined in the link:http://restfulobjects.org[Restful Objects spec] v1.0.

To use an alternative implementation, use Spring's link:https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/annotation/Order.html[`@Order`] annotation (as explained in the xref:refguide:applib-svc:about.adoc#overriding-the-services[introduction] to this guide).


== Registering the Services

Apache Isis' default implementation of `RepresentationService` service is automatically registered and injected (it is annotated with `@DomainService`) so no further configuration is required.



== Related Services

The default implementation delegates to xref:core:runtime-services:ContentNegotiationService.adoc[`ContentNegotiationService`], whose default implementation may delegate in turn to xref:refguide:applib-svc:ContentMappingService.adoc[`ContentMappingService`] (if present).
