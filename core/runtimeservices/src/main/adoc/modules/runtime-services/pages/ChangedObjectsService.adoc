The `ChangedObjectsServiceInternal` class is an (internal) request-scoped domain service that is responsible for collecting the details of all changes to domain objects within an interaction.
This is then used by various other  (internal) domain services, notably xref:core:runtime-services:AuditerDispatchService.adoc[`AuditerDispatchService`] and xref:core:runtime-services:PublisherDispatchService.adoc[`PublisherDispatchService`].



== SPI and Implementation

The SPI of the service is:

[source,java]
----
@RequestScoped
public class ChangedObjectsServiceInternal {
    public void enlistCreated(final ObjectAdapter adapter);                                     // <1>
    public void enlistUpdating(final ObjectAdapter adapter);
    public void enlistDeleting(final ObjectAdapter adapter);

    public boolean hasChangedAdapters();                                                        // <2>

    public Map<ObjectAdapter, PublishingChangeKind> getChangeKindByEnlistedAdapter();     // <3>
    public int numberObjectsDirtied();
    public int numberObjectPropertiesModified();

    public Set<Map.Entry<AdapterAndProperty, PreAndPostValues>> getChangedObjectProperties();   // <4>

    public void clearChangedObjectProperties();                                                 // <5>
}
----
<1> Enlists an object that has just been created, updated or deleted, capturing the pre-modification values of the properties.
<2> Used by the framework to determine whether to set the "persist hint" on the `Command` object (as per xref:refguide:applib-svc:CommandContext.adoc[`CommandContext`]).
<3> Used by xref:core:runtime-services:PublisherDispatchService.adoc[`PublisherDispatchService`] to obtain details of and
counters of all objects changed within the transaction.
<4> Used by xref:core:runtime-services:AuditerDispatchService.adoc[`AuditerDispatchService`] to obtain all pairs of
pre/post values of changed properties
<5> Called by the framework to for clean up after auditing and publishing has completed.

For enlisted objects, if just created, then a dummy value `"[NEW]"` is used for the pre-modification value; if just
deleted, then a dummy value `"[DELETED]"` is used for the post-modification value.  The post-modification values of
properties are captured when the transaction commits.


The service implementation is `o.a.i.c.r.s.changes.ChangedObjectsServiceInternal`.



== Registering the Service

Apache Isis' default implementation of `ChangedObjectsServiceInternal` class is automatically registered (it is annotated with `@DomainService`) so no further configuration is required.



== Related Classes

Both the xref:core:runtime-services:AuditerDispatchService.adoc[`AuditerDispatchService`] and xref:core:runtime-services:PublisherDispatchService.adoc[`PublisherDispatchService`] (internal) domain services query this object.
