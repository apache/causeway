No man is an island, and neither are most applications.  Chances are that at some point you may need to integrate your Apache Isis application to other external systems, possibly using old-style SOAP web services.  The SOAP client in this case could be a domain service within your app, or it might be externalized, eg invoked through a scheduler or using link:http://camel.apache.org[Apache Camel].

While you will want to (of course) perform manual system testing/UAT with a test instance of that external system, it's also useful to be able to perform unit testing of your SOAP client component.

The `SoapEndpointPublishingRule` is a simple JUnit rule that allows you to run a fake SOAP endpoint within an unit test.

[TIP]
====
The (non-ASF) link:https://platform.incode.org[Incode Platform^]'s publishmq module provides a full example of how to integrate and test an Apache Isis application with a (faked out) external system.

== `SoapEndpointPublishingRule`

The idea behind this rule is that you write a fake server endpoint that implements the same WSDL contract as the "real" external system does, but which also exposes additional API to specify responses (or throw exceptions) from SOAP calls.  It also typically records the requests and allows these to be queried.

In its setup your unit test and gets the rule to instantiate and publish that fake server endpoint, and then obtains a reference to that server endpoint.  It also instantiates the SOAP client, pointing it at the address (that is, a URL) that the fake server endpoint is running on.  This way the unit test has control of both the SOAP client and server: the software under test and its collaborator.

In the test methods your unit test sets up expectations on your fake server, and then exercises the SOAP client.  The SOAP client calls the fake server, which then responds accordingly.  The test can then assert that all expected interactions have occurred.

So that tests don't take too long to run, the rule puts the fake server endpoints onto a thread-local.  Therefore the unit tests should clear up any state on the fake server endpoints.

Your unit test uses the rule by specifying the endpoint class (must have a no-arg constructor):

[source,java]
----
public class FakeExternalSystemEndpointRuleTest {
    @Rule
    public SoapEndpointPublishingRule serverRule =
        new SoapEndpointPublishingRule(FakeExternalSystemEndpoint.class);         // <1>
    private FakeExternalSystemEndpoint fakeServerEndpoint;
    private DemoObject externalSystemContract;                                    // <2>
    @Before
    public void setUp() throws Exception {
        fakeServerEndpoint =
            serverRule.getEndpointImplementor(FakeExternalSystemEndpoint.class);  // <3>
        final String endpointAddress =
            serverRule.getEndpointAddress(FakeExternalSystemEndpoint.class);      // <4>
        final DemoObjectService externalSystemService =                           // <5>
                new DemoObjectService(ExternalSystemWsdl.getWsdl());              // <6>
        externalSystemContract = externalSystemService.getDemoObjectOverSOAP();
        BindingProvider provider = (BindingProvider) externalSystemContract;
        provider.getRequestContext().put(
                BindingProvider.ENDPOINT_ADDRESS_PROPERTY,
                endpointAddress)
        );
    }
    @Test
    public void happy_case() throws Exception {
        // given
        final Update update = new Update();                              // <7>
        ...
        // expect
        final UpdateResponse response = new UpdateResponse();            // <8>
        ...
        fakeServerEndpoint.control().setResponse(updateResponse);
        // when
        PostResponse response = externalSystemContract.post(update);     // <9>
        // then
        final List<Update> updates =                                     // <10>
            fakeServerEndpoint.control().getUpdates();
        ...
    }
}
----
<1> specify the class that implements the endpoint (must have a no-arg constructor)
<2> the SOAP contract as defined in WSDL and generated by wsdl2java
<3> get hold of the fake server-side endpoint from the rule...
<4> ... and its endpoint address
<5> use factory (also generated by wsdl2java) to create client-side endpoint
<6> `getWsdl()` is a utility method to return a URL for the WSDL (eg from the classpath)
<7> create a request object in order to invoke the SOAP web service
<8> instruct the fake server endpoint how to respond
<9> invoke the web service
<10> check the fake server endpoint was correctly invoked etc.


The rule can also host multiple endpoints; just provide multiple classes in the constructor:

[source,java]
----
@Rule
public SoapEndpointPublishingRule serverRule =
                new SoapEndpointPublishingRule(
                    FakeCustomersEndpoint.class,
                    FakeOrdersEndpoint.class,
                    FakeProductsEndpoint.class);
----

To lookup a particular endpoint, specify its type:

[source,java]
----
FakeProductsEndpoint fakeProductsServerEndpoint =
            serverRule.getPublishedEndpoint(FakeProductsEndpoint.class);
----

The endpoint addresses that the server endpoints run on are determined automatically.  If you want more control, then you can call one of ``SoapEndpointPublishingRule``'s overloaded constructors, passing in one or more `SoapEndpointSpec` instances.




== XML Marshalling Support

Apache Isis' unit testing support also provides helper `JaxbUtil` and `JaxbMatchers` classes.  These are useful if you have exampler XML-serialized representations of the SOAP requests and response payloads and want to use these within your tests.
