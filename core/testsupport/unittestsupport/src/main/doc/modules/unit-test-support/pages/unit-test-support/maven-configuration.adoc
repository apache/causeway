Apache Isis' unit test support is automatically configured if you use the xref:helloworld:ROOT:about.adoc[HelloWorld] or the xref:simpleapp:ROOT:about.adoc[SimpleApp] archetypes.
To set it up manually, update the `pom.xml` of your domain object model module:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.isis.core</groupId>
    <artifactId>isis-core-unittestsupport</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope> // <1>
</dependency>
----
<1> Normally `test`; usual Maven scoping rules apply.


[NOTE]
====
This can also be done by adding a dependency to `org.apache.isis.mavendeps:isis-mavendeps-testing` module; see the xref:simpleapp:ROOT:about.adoc[SimpleApp starter app].
====


We also recommend that you configure the `maven-surefire-plugin` to pick up the following class patterns:

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>2.10</version>
    <configuration>
        <includes>
            <include>**/*Test.java</include>
            <include>**/*Test_*.java</include>
            <include>**/*Spec*.java</include>
        </includes>
        <excludes>
            <exclude>**/Test*.java</exclude>
            <exclude>**/*ForTesting.java</exclude>
            <exclude>**/*Abstract*.java</exclude>
        </excludes>
        <useFile>true</useFile>
        <printSummary>true</printSummary>
        <outputDirectory>${project.build.directory}/surefire-reports</outputDirectory>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
----

[NOTE]
====
This can also be done using mavenmixins; see the xref:simpleapp:ROOT:about.adoc[SimpleApp starter app].
