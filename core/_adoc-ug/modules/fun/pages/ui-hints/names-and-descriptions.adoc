The name of classes and class members are usually inferred from the Java source code directly.
For example, an action method called `placeOrder` will be rendered as "Place Order", and a collection called `orderItems` is rendered as "Order Items".
The same is true for action parameter names also, though note that the code must be compiled with the `--parameters` flag (to javac).

Occasionally though the desired name is not possible; either the name is a Java reserved word (eg "class"), or might require characters that are not valid, for example abbreviations.

In such cases the name can be specified declaratively.

It is also possible to specify a description declaratively; this is used as a tooltip in the UI.

The table below summarizes the annotations available:

The framework also supports i18n: locale-specific names and descriptions.
