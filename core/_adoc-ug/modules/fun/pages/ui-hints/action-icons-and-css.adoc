Apache Isis allows link:http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/[font awesome] icons to be associated with each action, and for link:http://getbootstrap.com/css/#buttons[Bootstrap CSS] to be applied to action rendered as buttons.
These UI hints can be applied either to individual actions, or can be applied en-masse using pattern matching.

It is also possible to specify additional CSS for an object's members (not just actions).


== Icons

Action icons can be specified in several ways.

One option is to use the xref:rg:ant:ActionLayout/cssClassFa.adoc[`@ActionLayout#cssClassFa()`].
For example:

[source,java]
----
@ActionLayout(cssClassFa="refresh")
public void renew() {
    ...
}
----

Alternatively, you can specify these hints dynamically in the xref:vw:ROOT::layout.adoc[`Xxx.layout.xml`] for the entity:

[source,xml]
----
<cpt:action id="renew" cssClassFa="refresh"/>
----

Rather than annotating every action with xref:rg:ant:ActionLayout/cssClassFa.adoc[`@ActionLayout#cssClassFa()`] and xref:rg:ant:ActionLayout/cssClass.adoc[`@ActionLayout#cssClass()`] you can instead specify the UI hint globally using regular expressions.
Not only does this save a lot of boilerplate/editing, it helps ensure consistency across all actions.

To declare fa classes globally, use the xref:rg:cfg:configuring-core.adoc[configuration property] `isis.reflector.facet.cssClassFa.patterns` (a comma separated list of key:value pairs).

For example:

[source,ini]
----
isis.reflector.facet.cssClassFa.patterns=\
                        new.*:fa-plus,\
                        add.*:fa-plus-square,\
                        create.*:fa-plus,\
                        renew.*:fa-refresh,\
                        list.*:fa-list, \
                        all.*:fa-list, \
                        download.*:fa-download, \
                        upload.*:fa-upload, \
                        execute.*:fa-bolt, \
                        run.*:fa-bolt
----

Here:

* the key is a regex matching action names (eg `create.*`), and
* the value is a link:http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/[font-awesome] icon name

For example, "fa-plus" is applied to all action members called "newXxx"



== CSS

Similarly, a CSS class can be specified for object members:

* xref:rg:ant:ActionLayout/cssClass.adoc[`@ActionLayout#cssClass()`] for actions

* xref:rg:ant:PropertyLayout/cssClass.adoc[`@PropertyLayout#cssClass()`] for properties, and

* xref:rg:ant:CollectionLayout/cssClass.adoc[`@CollectionLayout#cssClass()`] for collections.

Again, this CSS class will be attached to an appropriate containing `<div>` or `<span>` on the rendered page.

Possible use cases for this is to highlight the most important properties of a domain object.


It is also possible to specify CSS classes globally, using the xref:rg:cfg:configuring-core.adoc[configuration property] `isis.reflector.facet.cssClass.patterns` configuration property.

For example:

[source,ini]
----
isis.reflector.facet.cssClass.patterns=\
                        delete.*:btn-warning
----

where (again):

* the key is a regex matching action names (eg `delete.*`), and
* the value is a link:http://getbootstrap.com/css/[Bootstrap] CSS button class (eg `btn-warning) to be applied
