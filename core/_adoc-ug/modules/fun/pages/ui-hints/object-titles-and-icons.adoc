In Apache Isis every object is identified to the user by a title (label) and an icon.
This is shown in several places: as the main heading for an object; as a link text for an object referencing another object, and also in tables representing collections of objects.

The icon is often the same for all instances of a particular class, but it's also possible for an individual instance to return a custom icon.
This could represent the state of that object (eg a shipped order, say, or overdue library book).

It is also possible for an object to provide a CSS class hint.
In conjunction with xref:vw:ROOT:customisation/tweaking-css-classes.adoc[customized CSS] this can be used to apply arbitrary styling; for example each object could be rendered in a page with a different background colour.


== Object Title

The object title is a label to identify an object to the end-user.
Generally the object title is a label to identify an object to the end-user.
There is no requirement for it to be absolutely unique, but it should be "unique enough" to distinguish the object from other object's likely to be rendered on the same page.

The title is always shown with an icon, so there is generally no need for the title to include information about the object's type.
For example the title of a customer object shouldn't include the literal string "Customer"; it can just have the customer's name, reference or some other meaningful business identifier.


=== Declarative style

The xref:rg:ant:Title.adoc[`@Title`] annotation can be used build up the title of an object from its constituent parts.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {

    @Title(sequence="1", append=" ")
    @lombok.Getter
    private String firstName;

    @Title(sequence="2")
    @lombok.Getter
    private String lastName;

    // ...
}
----

might return "Arthur Clarke", while:

[source,java]
----
public class CustomerAlt {

    @Title(sequence="2", prepend=", ")
    @lombok.Getter
    private String firstName;

    @Title(sequence="1")
    @lombok.Getter
    private String lastName;

    // ...
}
----

could return "Clarke, Arthur".

Note that the sequence is in Dewey Decimal Format, which allows a subclass to intersperse information within the title.
For example:


[source,java]
----
public class Author extends Customer {

    @Title(sequence="1.5", append=". ")
    @lombok.Getter
    private String middleInitial;

    // ...
}
----

could return "Arthur C. Clarke".



=== Imperative style

Alternatively, the title can be provided simply by implementing the xref:rg:cms:methods/reserved.adoc#title[`title()`] reserved method.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Author extends Customer {

    public String title() {
        final StringBuilder buf = new StringBuilder();
        buf.append(getFirstName());
        if(getMiddleInitial() != null) {
            buf.append(getMiddleInitial()).append(". ");
        }
        buf.append(getLastName();
        return buf.toString();
    }

    // ...
}
----

A variation on this approach also supports localized names; see xref:ug:btb:i18n.adoc[beyond-the-basics] guide for further details.


=== Using a UI subscriber

A third alternative is to move the responsibility for deriving the title into a separate subscriber object.

In the target object, we define an appropriate event type and use the xref:rg:ant:DomainObjectLayout.adoc#titleUiEvent[`@DomainObjectLayout#titleUiEvent()`] attribute to specify:

[source,java]
----
@DomainObjectLayout(
    titleUiEvent = Author.TitleUiEvent.class
)
public class Author extends Customer {
    public static class TitleUiEvent
            extends org.apache.isis.applib.events.ui.TitleUiEvent<Author> {}

    //...
}
----

The subscriber can then populate this event:

[source,java]
----
import org.springframework.context.event.EventListener;

@DomainService(nature=NatureOfService.DOMAIN)
public class AuthorSubscriptions extends AbstractSubscriber {

    @EventListener(Author.TitleUiEvent.class)
    public void on(Author.TitleUiEvent ev) {
        Author author = ev.getSource();
        ev.setTitle(titleOf(author));
    }

    private String titleOf(Author author) {
        StringBuilder buf = new StringBuilder();
        buf.append(author.getFirstName());
        if(author.getMiddleInitial() != null) {
            buf.append(author.getMiddleInitial()).append(". ");
        }
        buf.append(author.getLastName());
        return buf.toString();
    }
}
----


== Object Icon

The icon is often the same for all instances of a particular class, and is picked up by convention.

It's also possible for an individual instance to return a custom icon, typically so that some significant state of that domain object is represented.
For example, a custom icon could be used to represent a shipped order, say, or an overdue library loan.


=== Declarative style

If there is no requirement to customize the icon (the normal case), then the icon is usually picked up as the `.png` file in the same package as the class.
For example, the icon for a class `org.mydomain.myapp.Customer` will be `org/mydomain/myapp/Customer.png` (if it exists).

Alternatively, a font-awesome icon can be used.
This is specified using the xref:rg:ant:DomainObjectLayout.adoc#cssClassFa[`@DomainObjectLayout#cssClassFa()`] attribute or in the xref:vw:ROOT:layout/file-based.adoc[layout.xml] file.

For example:

[source,java]
----
@DomainObjectLayout( cssClassFa="play" )    // <1>
public class InvoiceRun {
    // ...
}
----
<1> will use the "fa-play" icon.



=== Imperative style

To customise the icon on an instance-by-instance basis, we implement the reserved xref:rg:cms:methods/reserved.adoc#iconName[`iconName()`] method.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Order {
    public String iconName() {
        return isShipped() ? "shipped": null;
    }
    // ..
}
----

In this case, if the `Order` has shipped then the framework will look for an icon image named "Order-shipped.png" (in the same package as the class).
Otherwise it will just use "Order.png", as normal.



=== Using a UI subscriber

As for title, the determination of which image file to use for the icon can be externalized into a UI event subscriber.

In the target object, we define an appropriate event type and use the xref:rg:ant:DomainObjectLayout.adoc#iconUiEvent[`@DomainObjectLayout#iconUiEvent()`] attribute to specify.

For example:

[source,java]
----
@DomainObjectLayout(
    iconUiEvent = Author.IconUiEvent.class
)
public class Order {
    public static class IconUiEvent
            extends org.apache.isis.applib.events.ui.IconUiEvent<Order> {}
    // ..
}
----

The subscriber can then populate this event:

// *TODO: v2: *what annotation is required for SpringBoot event subscribers?

[source,java]
----
@DomainService(nature=NatureOfService.DOMAIN)
public class OrderSubscriptions extends AbstractSubscriber {

    @org.axonframework.eventhandling.EventHandler       p
    @com.google.common.eventbus.Subscribe               // if using guava
    public void on(Order.IconUiEvent ev) {
        Order order = ev.getSource();
        ev.setIconName(iconNameOf(order);
    }

    private String iconNameOf(Order order) {
        StringBuilder buf = new StringBuilder();
        return order.isShipped() ? "shipped": null;
    }
}
----



== Object CSS Styling

It is also possible for an object to return a xref:rg:cms:methods/reserved.adoc#cssClass[CSS class].
In conjunction with xref:vw:ROOT:customisation/tweaking-css-classes.adoc[customized CSS] this can be used to apply arbitrary styling; for example each object could be rendered in a page with a different background colour.



=== Declarative style

To render an object with a particular CSS, use
xref:rg:ant:DomainObjectLayout.adoc#cssClass[`@DomainObjectLayout#cssClass()`] or in the xref:vw:ROOT:layout/file-based.adoc[layout.xml] file.

When the domain object is rendered on its own page, this CSS class will appear on a top-level `<div>`.
Or, when the domain object is rendered as a row in a collection, then the CSS class will appear in a `<div>` wrapped by the `<tr>` of the row.

One possible use case would be to render the most important object types with a subtle background colour: ``Customer``s shown in light green, or ``Order``s shown in a light pink, for example.



=== Imperative style


To customise the icon on an instance-by-instance basis, we implement the reserved xref:rg:cms:methods/reserved.adoc#cssClass[`cssClass()`] method.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Order {
    public String cssClass() {
        return isShipped() ? "shipped": null;       <1>
    }
    // ...
}
----
<1> the implementation might well be the same as the `iconName()`.

If non-null value is returned then the CSS class will be rendered _in addition_ to any declarative CSS class also specified.


=== Using a UI subscriber


As for title and icon, the determination of which CSS class to render can be externalized into a UI event subscriber.

In the target object, we define an appropriate event type and use the xref:rg:ant:DomainObjectLayout.adoc#cssClassUiEvent[`@DomainObjectLayout#cssClassUiEvent()`] attribute to specify.

For example

[source,java]
----
@DomainObjectLayout( cssClassUiEvent = Author.CssClassUiEvent.class )
public class Order {
    public static class CssClassUiEvent
            extends org.apache.isis.applib.events.ui.CssClassUiEvent<Order> {}
    // ..
}
----

The subscriber can then populate this event:

[source,java]
----
import org.springframework.context.event.EventListener;

@DomainService(nature=NatureOfService.DOMAIN)
public class OrderSubscriptions extends AbstractSubscriber {

    @EventListener(Order.CssClassUiEvent.class)
    public void on(Order.CssClassUiEvent ev) {
        Order order = ev.getSource();
        ev.setIconName(cssClassOf(order));
    }

    private static String cssClassOf(Order order) {
        return order.isShipped() ? "shipped": null;
    }
}
----
