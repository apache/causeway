While xref:ug:fun:programming-model.adoc#collections[collections] define the state held by a domain object (its "know what" responsibilities), actions define the object's behaviour (its "know how-to" responsibilities).

An application whose domain objects have only/mostly "know-what" responsibilities is pretty dumb: it requires that the end-user know the business rules and doesn't modify the state of the domain objects such that they are invalid (for example, an "end date" being before a "start date").
Such applications are often called CRUD applications (create/read/update/delete).

In more complex domains, it's not realistic/feasible to expect the end-user to have to remember all the different business rules that govern the valid states for each domain object.
So instead actions allow those business rules to be encoded programmatically.
An Apache Isis application doesn't try to constrain the end-user in how they interact with the UI (it doesn't attempt to define a rigid business process) but it _does_ aim to ensure that business rule invariants are maintained, that is that business objects aren't allowed to go into an invalid state.

For simple domain applications, you may want to start prototyping only with properties, and only later introduce actions (representing the most common business operations).
But an alternative approach, recommended for more complex applications, is actually to start the application with all properties non-editable.
Then, as the end-user requires the ability to modify some state, there is a context in which to ask the question "why does this state need to change?" and "are their any side-effects?" (ie, other state that changes at the same time, or other behaviour that should occur).
If the state change is simple, for example just being able to correct an invalid address, or adding a note or comment, then that can probably be modelled as a simple editable property.
But if the state change is more complex, then most likely an action should be used instead.


== Defining actions

If the xref:cfg:ROOT:configuring-core.adoc#policy[`isis.reflector.explicitAnnotations.action`] configuration property is set (recommended), then actions are `public` methods with the xref:applib:ant:Action.adoc[`@Action`] annotation.
This annotation can also specify additional domain semantics, for example regarding idempotency.

For example:

[source,java]
----
@Action(semantics=SemanticsOf.IDEMPOTENT)       // <1>
public ShoppingBasket addToBasket(
        Product product,
        @ParameterLayout(named="Quantity")      // <2>
        int quantity
        ) {
    ...
    return this;
}
----
<1> `@Action` annotation indicates that this public method is an action..
<2> The names of action parameters (as rendered in the UI) will by default be the parameter types, not the paramter names.
+
For the `product` parameter this is reasonable, but not so for the `quantity` parameter (which would by default show up with a name of "int".
The `@ParameterLayout` annotation provides a UI hint to the framework.

If the xref:cfg:ROOT:configuring-core.adoc#policy[`isis.reflector.explicitAnnotations.action`] configuration property is _not_ set, then the rules are a little more involved: an action is a public method that is not getters or setters which represent properties or collections, and does not have one of the various method prefixes (such as `hide` or `validate`) used for represent xref:ug:fun:business-rules.adoc[business rules]), and is not annotated with xref:applib:ant:Programmatic.adoc[`@Programmatic`].




== (Reference) Parameter types

Parameter types can be value types or reference types.
In the case of primitive types, the end-user can just enter the value directly through the parameter field.
In the case of reference types however (such as `Product`), a drop-down must be provided from which the end-user to select.
This is done using either a supporting xref:applib:cms:methods.adoc#choices[`choices`] or xref:applib:cms:methods.adoc#autoComplete[`autoComplete`] method.
The "choices" is used when there is a limited set of options, while "autoComplete" is used when there are large set of options such that the end-user must provide some characters to use for a search.

For example, the `addToBasket(...)` action shown above might well have an autocomplete supporting method :

[source,java]
----
@Action(semantics=SemanticsOf.IDEMPOTENT)
public ShoppingBasket addToBasket(
        Product product,
        @ParameterLayout(named="Quantity")
        int quantity
        ) {
    ...
    return this;
}
public List<Product> autoComplete0AddToBasket(              // <1>
    @MinLength(3)                                           // <2>
    String searchTerm) {
    return productRepository.find(searchTerm);              // <3>
}
@javax.inject.Inject
ProductRepository productRepository;
----
<1> Supporting `autoComplete` method.
The "0" in the name means that this corresponds to parameter 0 of the "addToBasket" action (ie `Product`).
It is also required to return a Collection of that type.
<2> The xref:applib:ant:MinLength.adoc[`@MinLength`] annotation defines how many characters the end-user must enter before performing a search.
<3> The implementation delegates to an injected repository service.  This is typical.

Note that it is also valid to define "choices" and "autoComplete" for value types (such as `quantity`, above); it just isn't as common to do so.

=== Removing boilerplate

To save having to define an `autoCompleteNXxx(...)` method everywhere that a reference to a particular type (such as `Product`) appears as an action parameter, it is also possible to use the `@DomainObject` annotation on `Product` itself:

[source,java]
----
@DomainObject(
    autoCompleteRepository=ProductRepository.class          // <1>
    autoCompleteAction="find"                               // <2>
)
public class Product ... {
    ...
}
----
<1> Whenever an action parameter requiring a `Product` is defined, provide an autoComplete drop-down automatically
<2> Use the "find" method of `ProductRepository` (rather than the default name of "autoComplete")

(As noted above), if the number of available instances of the reference type is a small number (in other words, all of which could comfortably be shown in a drop-down) then instead the `choicesNXxx()` supporting method can be used.
This too can be avoided by annotating the referenced class.

For example, suppose we have an action to specify the `PaymentMethodType`, where there are only 10 or so such (Visa, Mastercard, Amex, Paypal etc).
We could define this as:

[source,java]
----
@Action
public Order payUsing(PaymentMethodType type) {
    ...
}
----

where `PaymentMethodType` would be annotated using:

[source,java]
----
@DomainObject(
    bounded=true                            // <1>
)
public class PaymentMethodType ... {
    ...
}
----
<1> only a small (ie "bounded") number of instances available, meaning that the framework should render all in a drop-down.


== Collection Parameter types

Action parameters can also be collections of values (for example `List<String>`), or can be collections of references (such as `List<Customer>`).

For example:

[source,java]
----
@Action(semantics=SemanticsOf.IDEMPOTENT)
public ShoppingBasket addToBasket(
        List<Product> products,
        @ParameterLayout(named="Quantity") int quantity
        ) {
    ...
    return this;
}
public List<Product> autoComplete0AddToBasket(@MinLength(3) String searchTerm) {
    return ...
}
----

As the example suggests, any collection parameter type must provide a way to select items, either by way of a "choices" or "autoComplete" supporting method or alternatively defined globally using xref:applib:ant:DomainObject.adoc[`@DomainObject`] on the referenced type (described xref:ug:fun:programming-model.adoc#actions#reference-parameter-types[above]).


== Optional Parameters

Whereas the xref:ug:fun:programming-model.adoc#properties.adoc#optional-properties[optionality of properties] is defined using xref:applib:ant:Column#allowsNull[`@javax.jdo.annotations.Column#allowsNull()`], that JDO annotation cannot be applied to parameter types.
Instead, either the xref:applib:ant:Nullable.adoc[`@Nullable`] annotation or the xref:applib:ant:Parameter.adoc#optionality[`@Parameter#optionality()`]  annotation/attribute is used.

For example:

[source,java]
----
@javax.jdo.annotations.Column(allowsNull="true")                // <1>
@lombok.Getter @lombok.Setter
private LocalDate shipBy;

@Action(semantics=SemanticsOf.IDEMPOTENT)
public Order invoice(
                PaymentMethodType paymentMethodType,
                @Nullable                                       // <2>
                @ParameterLayout(named="Ship no later than")
                LocalDate shipBy) {
    ...
    setShipBy(shipBy)
    return this;
}
----
<1> Specifies the property is optional.
<2> Specifies the corresponding parameter is optional.

See also xref:ug:fun:programming-model.adoc#properties-vs-parameters[properties vs parameters].

== ``String`` Parameters (Length)

Whereas the length of string properties is defined using xref:applib:ant:Column#length-for-strings.adoc[`@javax.jdo.annotations.Column#length()`], that JDO annotation cannot be applied to parameter types.
Instead, the xref:applib:ant:Parameter.adoc#maxLength[`@Parameter#maxLength()`] annotation/attribute is used.

For example:

[source,java]
----
@javax.jdo.annotations.Column(length=50)                // <1>
@lombok.Getter @lombok.Setter
private String firstName;

@javax.jdo.annotations.Column(length=50)
@lombok.Getter @lombok.Setter
private String lastName;

public Customer updateName(
                @Parameter(maxLength=50)                // <2>
                @ParameterLayout(named="First name")
                String firstName,
                @Parameter(maxLength=50)
                @ParameterLayout(named="Last name")
                String lastName) {
    setFirstName(firstName);
    setLastName(lastName);
    return this;
}
----
<1> Specifies the property length using the JDO xref:applib:ant:Column#length.adoc[`@Column#length()`] annotation
<2> Specifies the parameter length using the (Apache Isis) xref:applib:ant:Parameter.adoc#maxLength[`@Parameter#maxLength()`] annotation

[IMPORTANT]
====
Incidentally, note in the above example that the new value is assigned to the properties using the setter methods; the action does not simply set the instance field directly.
This is important, because it allows JDO/DataNucleus to keep track that this instance variable is "dirty" and so needs flushing to the database table before the transaction completes.

== ``BigDecimal``s (Precision)

Whereas the precision of `BigDecimal` properties is defined using xref:applib:ant:Column#scale.adoc[`@javax.jdo.annotations.Column#scale()`], that JDO annotation cannot be applied to parameter types.
Instead, the xref:applib:ant:Digits.adoc[`@javax.validation.constraints.Digits#fraction()`] annotation/attribute is used.

For example:

[source,java]
----
@javax.jdo.annotations.Column(scale=2)                              // <1>
@lombok.Getter @lombok.Setter
private BigDecimal discountRate;

public Order updateDiscount(
                @javax.validation.constraints.Digits(fraction=2)    // <2>
                @ParameterLayout(named="Discount rate")
                String discountRate) {
    setDiscountRate(discountRate);
    return this;
}
----
<1> Specifies the property precision using xref:applib:ant:Column#scale.adoc[`@Column#scale()`]
<2> Specifies the corresponding parameter precision using xref:applib:ant:Digits.adoc[`@Digits#fraction()`].
