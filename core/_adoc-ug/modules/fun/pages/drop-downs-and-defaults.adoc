Invoking an action whose parameters are primitives or values (int, date, string etc) is simple: the user can just type in or use a date picker.
Invoking an action with a parameter of reference type (such as `Customer` or `Order`) requires the viewer to provide some mechanism by which the end-user can select the relevant instance.

If the list of available options is fixed then the developer can provided a list a xref:rg:cms:methods/prefixes.adoc#choices[`choices...()`] supporting method (for either and action parameter or when editing a property).
These are rendered in a drop-down.

If the list of available options is much larger, then the developer can use an xref:rg:cms:methods/prefixes.adoc#autoComplete[`autoComplete...()`] supporting method.
The user user enters a few characters and this is used to search for matching reference(s), again rendered in a drop-down.

Similarly, when invoking an action, there may well be suitable defaults for the action arguments.
For example, if placing an `Order` then -- even if the `Product` argument might not have a sensible default -- the quantity argument could reasonably be defaulted to 1.
Or, the `Product` might indeed have a default, say the product previously placed by this user.
The developer indicates this using a xref:rg:cms:methods/prefixes.adoc#default[`default...()`] supporting method.


== Choices and Default

For example, _choices_ for a property are specified using:

[source,java]
----
@Getter @Setter
private String paymentMethod;

public List<String> choicesPaymentMethod() {
    return Arrays.asList("Visa", "Mastercard", "Amex");
}
----

Note the "choices" prefix and the suffix matching up with the getter.

Or, for an action the _choices_ and a suitable _default_ method would be:

[source,java]
----
public Order changePaymentMethod(
                @ParameterLayout(named="Payment Method")
                String paymentMethod) {
    setPaymentMethod(paymentMethod);
    return this;
}

public List<String> choices0ChangePaymentMethod() {
    return Arrays.asList("Visa", "Mastercard", "Amex");
}

public String default0ChangePaymentMethod() {
    return getPaymentMethod();
}
----

Note the "choices" and "default" prefix, the digit is the 0-based argument number, while the suffix matches up with the action's name.


== AutoComplete

The _autocomplete_ is similar to _choices_, but accepts a string parameter, to search for matching results.
A property for example might have:

[source,java]
----
@Getter @Setter
private Product product;

public List<Product> autoCompleteProduct(@MinLength(2) String search) {
    return productRepository.findByReferenceOrName(search);
}
----

Note the "autoComplete" prefix, while (again) the suffix matches up with the getter.
The `@MinLength(...)` annotation indicates the minimum number of characters that must be entered before a search is initiated.

Actions are very similar:

[source,java]
----
public Order changeProduct(Product product) {
    setProduct(product);
    return this;
}

public List<Product> autoComplete0Product(@MinLength(2) String search) {
    return productRepository.findByReferenceOrName(search);
}
----

An _autoComplete_ method can be used in conjunction with a _default_ method, but it doesn't make sense to provide both an _autoComplete_ and a _choices_ method.



== "Globally" defined drop-downs

Very often the set of available choices depends on the data type of the property/action parameter, rather than the individual property/parameter itself.
And similarly the algorithm to search for references again may well depend only on that reference type.

In the case of _choices_, annotating a class as "bounded" (as in a "bounded" or fixed number of instances) means that a _choices_ drop-down will automatically be defined.
For example:

[source,java]
----
@DomainObject(
    bounded = true
)
public class Product { /* ... */ }
----

For more on this, see xref:rg:ant:DomainObject.adoc#bounding[`@DomainObject#bounding()`].

Or, if the data type is an enum, then a drop-down will be provided automatically.
A payment method is a good example of this:


[source,java]
----
public enum PaymentMethod {
    VISA, MASTERCARD, AMEX;
}
----

Something similar can be achieved for _autoComplete_.
Here the domain object indicates a repository query to execute.
For example:

[source,java]
----
@DomainObject(
    autoCompleteRepository = Customers.class,
    autoCompleteAction = "findByReferenceOrName"
)
public class Customer { /* ... */ }
----

with:

[source,java]
----
@DomainService(nature=NatureOfService.VIEW_MENU_ONLY)
public class Customers {
    @Action(semantics=SemanticsOf.SAFE)
    public List<Customer> findByReferenceOrName(@MinLength(3) String refOrName) {
        ...
    }
}
----

For more on this, see xref:rg:ant:DomainObject.adoc#autoCompleteRepository[`@DomainObject#autoCompleteRepository()`].

[TIP]
====
There's no need for the nominated method to be an actual action; any method of any domain service will do, so long as it accepts a string and returns the correct list.
====


== Multi-select action parameters

As well as scalar values, action parameters can also be collections.
For this to be valid, a _choices_ or _autoComplete_ supporting method must be provided.

For example, suppose we want to "tag" or "label" an object:

[source,java]
----
public StoryCard tag(List<Tag> tags) {
    getTags().addAll(tags);
}

public List<Tag> autoCompleteTag(@MinLength(1) search) {
    return tagRepository.findByName(search);
}
----




== Dependent choices for action parameters

For action it is also possible (in a limited form) to define dependencies between parameters.
Specifically, if one parameter is a drop-down choice, then other drop-down choices can be derived from it.

A good example is a category/sub-category:

[source,java]
----
public ToDoItem categorize(Category category, Subcategory subcategory) {
    setCategory(category);
    setSubcategory(subcategory);
}

public List<Category> choices0Categorize() {
    return categoryRepository.allCategories();
}
public List<Subcategory> choices1Categorize(Category category) {
    return subcategoryRepository.findBy(category);
}
----

Note how the _choices_ method for the 2nd parameter also accepts the first parameter.
