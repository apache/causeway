Once a domain entity has been instantiated and initialized, it can be persisted using the xref:rg:svc:persistence-layer-api/RepositoryService.adoc[`RepositoryService`].

For example:

[source,java]
----
Customer customer = ...

repositoryService.persist(customer);
----

If using the no-arg form to instantiate the entity, then (to save having to inject the `FactoryService` as well), the `RepositoryService` can also be used to instantiate.
This gives rise to this common idiom:

[source,java]
----
Customer customer = repositoryService.instantiate(Customer.class);
customer.setReference(reference);
customer.setFirstName(firstName);
customer.setLastName(lastName);
// ...
repositoryService.persist(customer);
----

On the other hand, there is often little need to inject services into the domain entity between its instantiation and persistence.
If the domain entity has an N-arg constructor, then the code is often simpler:

[source,java]
----
Customer customer = repositoryService.persist(new Customer(reference, name, lastname));
----

Note that the `persist()` returns the object passed to it.


== Eager Persistence

It's worth being aware that the framework does _not_ eagerly persist the object.
Rather, it queues up an internal command structure representing the object persistence request.
This is then executed either at the end of the transaction, or if a xref:ug:fun:crud/finding.adoc[query is run], or if the internal queue is manually flushed using xref:rg:svc:application-layer-api/TransactionService.adoc[`TransactionService`]'s `flush()` method.
Flushing also happens when a repository query is executed, so that the pending persist operation is performed first.
Generally therefore the lazy persistence approach works well enough.

Nevertheless, if you want to ensure that the persist command is flushed immediately, you can use:

[source,java]
----
repositoryService.persistAndFlush(customer);
----

When an object is persisted the framework will emit `ObjectPersistingEvent` and `ObjectPersistedEvent` xref:ug:fun:building-blocks.adoc#lifecycle-events[lifecycle events].


== Persistence by Reachability

It is also possible to configure DataNucleus to automatically persist domain entities if they are associated with other already-persistent entities.
This avoid the need to explicitly call "persist".

For this, configure the persistence-by-reachability property:

.isis.properties
[source,ini]
----
isis.persistor.datanucleus.impl.datanucleus.persistenceByReachabilityAtCommit=true
----

The downside is that the code is arguably less easy to debug.
