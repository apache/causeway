The framework emits events when it interacts with domain objects; the domain application can listen to these events and use them to influence the interaction (including veto'ing it).

These events fall into three broad categories: UI hints, domain and persistence lifecycles.


== UI Events

As specified using xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/DomainObjectLayout.adoc[@DomainObjectLayout#xxxUiEvent()].

(Event\nBus) as EB
(Spring) as SPRING
SPRING .l.> EB : provides/\nmanages
(Event\nListener) as EL
EL --> EB : listens to \n (is subscribed to)

(UI\nEvent) as UIE
UIE -r-> EB : is \n published \n to

CCUIE -u-> UIE : is a
(Layout\nUIEvent) as LUIE
LUIE -u-> UIE : is a


(Domain\nObject) as DO
DO "when \n rendered, \n leads to \n emission \nof"-d-> UIE

(Presentation) as PST
DO -u-> PST : has
EL -u-> PST : can modify
note right of EL
When DomainObject implements
respective supporting methods itself (
* title(),
* iconName(),
* cssClass(),
* layout()),
modification is not possible.
end note

== Domain Events

As specified using xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/Action.adoc[@Action#domainEvent()], xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/Property.adoc[@Property#domainEvent()] and xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/Collection.adoc[@Collection#domainEvent()]:

(Event\nBus) as EB
(Spring) as SPRING
SPRING .l.> EB : provides/\nmanages
EX -> EB : is published as: \n * before event (phase: EXECUTING)\n * after event (phase: EXECUTED)

(Event\nListener) as EL
EL --> EB : listens \n on
EL -u-> MB : can check/modify: \nvisibility (hide), \nusability (disable), \nvalidity (validate)

note right of DE
Phases are:
* HIDING
* DISABLING
* VALIDATING
* EXECUTING
* EXECUTED
The framework automatically sends out
events with the phases in the order listed.
end note

note right of MB
<i>DomainEvent</i> is declared as an
annotation type element in a member annotation, e.g.
<b>@Action(
        <b>domainEvent=<i>Custom</i>ActionDomainEvent.class).
end note

note right of EL
EventListeners can be declared on
any public Spring bean method, e.g.
<b>@EventListener(
       <b><i>Custom</i>ActionDomainEvent.class).
Via <i>DomainEvent</i>.getEventPhase(),
further filtering can be applied.

note top of RNG
JPA/Eclipselink
does not support
something like a
"Removed Event".
Hence not implemented.
