This module contains the classes that are used to build the internal metamodel by introspecting the domain classes.

Many of the services defined (as interfaces) in the applib have implementations defined in this module (the rest are defined in xref:core:runtimeservices:about.adoc[]).

== What makes up the metamodel

The classes in this module are used to build up the metamodel from a variety of inputs sources:

== Metamodel Concepts

The metamodel itself consists of the following parts:

Thus:

* _Domain Objects_ have *_Properties_*, *_Collections_*

* *_Viewmodels_* and *_Entities_* are specializations of *_Domain Objects_*.

** _View Models_ are (lifecycle-) managed by _Apache Causeway_
** _Entities_ are managed by the configured persistence mechanism.

* *_Services_* in general are (lifecycle-) managed by _Spring_.
+
Some _Services_ are also *_included_* in the metamodel; we call these *_Domain Services_* (annotated with xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/DomainService.adoc[]).
Their _Actions_ (like _Domain Objects_') will be visible either _Menu Actions_ in the xref:vw:ROOT:about.adoc[Wicket UI] and/or through the xref:vro:ROOT:about.adoc[REST API].

* *_Mixins_* _contribute_ either a _Property_, a _Collection_
or an _Action_ to their *_Mixee_* (-type).
