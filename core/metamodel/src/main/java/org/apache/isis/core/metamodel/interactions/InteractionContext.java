/**
 * Represents an interaction between the framework and (a {@link Facet} of) the
 * domain object.
 *
 * <p>
 * There are two main responsibilities:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Wraps up a target object, parameters and a {@link Authentication}.
 * Defining this as a separate interface makes for a more stable API</li>
 * <li>Acts as a factory for the corresponding {@link InteractionEvent} (more on
 * this below).</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * The {@link InteractionContext} hierarchy is parallel to the
 * {@link InteractionEvent} hierarchy. Having parallel hierarchies is a bit of a
 * code-smell. However, it is required because the {@link InteractionContext
 * context} hierarchy is internal to the framework (with references to
 * {@link ManagedObject}s, {@link Authentication}s and so forth), whereas
 * the {@link InteractionEvent event} hierarchy is part of AppLib, that is
 * public API.
 *
 * <p>
 * The class is generic so that the 
 * {@link InteractionEventSupplier#createInteractionEvent() factory method} 
 * can return the correct subclass without having to downcast.
