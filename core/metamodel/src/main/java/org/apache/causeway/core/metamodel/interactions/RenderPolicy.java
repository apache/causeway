/**
 * <h1>Troubleshooting Visibility and Usability</h1>
 * <p>
 * There are many reasons why a given action or property might be hidden or disabled.
 * It might be because of the state of the object means that an actionâ€™s preconditions are not met
 * (eg toggle and untoggle), or it might be because of security.
 * <p>
 * Sometimes though the reason why an action or property is hidden is a puzzle;
 * you are pretty sure that it should be shown, and yet for some reason it is not.
 * <p>
 * To help diagnose these issues, there are two configuration properties you can set. They only apply if running in prototype mode:
 * <ol>
 * <li>
 * causeway.prototyping.if-hidden-policy
 * If not specified or is set to HIDE, then the behaviour is as per normal.
 * However, if set to SHOW_AS_DISABLED then instead the action or property will be shown,
 * but disabled with the veto providing some explanation as to why. And, if set to SHOW_AS_DISABLED_WITH_DIAGNOSTICS,
 * then the class name of the metamodel facet that vetoed the visibility is also shown in the tooltip.
 * </li><li>
 * causeway.prototyping.if-disabled-policy
 * If not specified or is set to DISABLED, then the behaviour is as per normal.
 * But if set to SHOW_AS_DISABLED_WITH_DIAGNOSTICS,
 * then the class name of the metamodel facet that vetoed the usability is also shown in the tooltip.
 * </li>
 * </ol>
