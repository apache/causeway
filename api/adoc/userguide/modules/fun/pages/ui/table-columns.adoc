The optional xref:refguide:applib-svc:TableColumnOrderService.adoc[`TableColumnOrderService`] SPI service can be used to reorder columns in a table, either for a parented collection (owned by parent domain object) or a standalone collection (returned from an action invocation).

For example, suppose there is a `Customer` and an `Order`:

[plantuml]
....
Customer "1" *-r-> "0..*" Order : "    orders"

class Order {
    int num
    Date placedOn
    Date shippedOn
    State state
}
....

The order of these properties of `Order`, when rendered in the context of its owning `Customer`, can be controlled using this implementation of `TableColumnOrderService`:

[source,java]
----
@Service
@Order(100)                                             // <.>
public class TableColumnOrderServiceForCustomerOrders
                 implements TableColumnOrderService {
    public List<String> orderParented(
            final Object parent,
            final String collectionId,
            final Class<?> collectionType,
            final List<String> propertyIds) {
        return parent instanceof Customer &&            // <.>
               "orders".equals(collectionId)
               ? Arrays.asList("num", "placedOn", "state", "shippedOn")
               : null;
    }
    public List<String> orderStandalone(
            final Class<?> collectionType,
            final List<String> propertyIds) {
        return null;                                    // <.>
    }
}
