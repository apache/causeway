WARNING: TODO: v2: extend this/fix for Spring Boot scopes; does it support CDI annotation? which other scopes are supported?

By default all domain services are considered to be singletons, and thread-safe.

Sometimes though a service's lifetime is applicable only to a single request; in other words it is request-scoped.

The CDI annotation xref:refguide:applib-ant:RequestScoped.adoc[`@javax.enterprise.context.RequestScoped`] is used to indicate this fact:

[source,java]
----
@javax.enterprise.context.RequestScoped
public class MyService extends AbstractService {
    ...
}
----

The framework provides a number of request-scoped services, including a xref:refguide:applib-svc:Scratchpad.adoc[`Scratchpad`] service and a query results caching through the xref:refguide:applib-svc:QueryResultsCache.adoc[`QueryResultsCache`].
See the xref:refguide:applib-svc:about.adoc[domain services] reference guide for further details.
