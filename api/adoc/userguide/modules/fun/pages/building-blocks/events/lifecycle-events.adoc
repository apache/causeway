Lifecycle events allow domain object subscribers to listen for changes to the persistence state of domain entities, and act accordingly.

[NOTE]
====
Lifecycle events are _not_ fired for view models.
====


The lifecycle events supported are:

* object created - just instantiated. +
+
Note that this requires that the object is instantiated using the framework, see xref:userguide:fun:crud/instantiating.adoc[here] for further discussion

* updated loaded - just retrieved from the database

* object persisting - object about to be inserted into the database

* object persisted - object just inserted into the database

* object updating - object about to be updated

* object updated - object just updated

* object removing - object about to be deleted from the database

There is no lifecycle event for object creating because the framework doesn't know about newly created objects until they have been created; and there is no lifecycle event for obejcts removed because it is not valid to "touch" a domain entity once deleted.


For example, if annotated with xref:refguide:applib-ant:DomainObject.adoc#updatingLifecycleEvent[`@DomainObjectLayout#updatingLifecycleEvent()`], the appropriate (subclass of) `ObjectUpdatingEvent` will be emitted.
 Similarly for xref:refguide:applib-ant:DomainObjectLayout.adoc#iconUiEvent[`iconUiEvent()`] and xref:refguide:applib-ant:DomainObjectLayout.adoc#cssClassUiEvent[`cssClassUiEvent()`].
