As explained xref:userguide:fun:building-blocks.adoc#title-and-icon-and-css-class[earlier], to allow the end-user to distinguish one domain object from another, it is rendered with a title and an icon.

xref:userguide:fun:ui-hints/object-titles-and-icons.adoc[Normally] the code to return title and icon of an object is part of the domain object's implementation.
However, UI events allow this title and icon to be provided instead by a subscriber.
UI events have higher precedence than the other mechanisms of supplying a title.

If annotated with xref:refguide:applib-ant:DomainObjectLayout.adoc#titleUiEvent[`@DomainObjectLayout#titleUiEvent()`], the appropriate (subclass of) `TitleUiEvent` will be emitted.
 Similarly for xref:refguide:applib-ant:DomainObjectLayout.adoc#iconUiEvent[`iconUiEvent()`] and xref:refguide:applib-ant:DomainObjectLayout.adoc#cssClassUiEvent[`cssClassUiEvent()`].

This can be particularly useful for xref:userguide:fun:programming-model.adoc#jaxb[JAXB-style view models] which are code generated from XSDs and so cannot have any dependencies on the rest of the Apache Isis framework.
Here a subscriber on the default events can provide a title and icon for such an object.
Behaviour on such DTOs can also be provided using xref:userguide:fun:building-blocks.adoc#mixins[mixins].

Events also allow one module to influence/fine-tune the title of entities provided by some other module.
One such case is when reusing library modules, eg as provided by (non-ASF) link:https://platform.incode.org[Incode Platform^].
