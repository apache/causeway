_Domain services_ are (usually) singleton stateless services that provide additional functionality.
Domain services consist of a set of logically grouped actions, and as such follow the same conventions as for entities.
However, a service cannot have (persisted) properties, nor can it have (persisted) collections.

A very common type of domain service is a repository, that is used to look up existing instances of a domain entity.
For example, for the `Customer` entity there may be a `CustomerRepository`, while for `Order` entity there may be an `OrderRepository`.

Similarly, entities might also have a corresponding factory service: a `CustomerFactory` or an `OrderFactory`; Evans' link:http://books.google.com/books/about/Domain_Driven_Design.html?id=hHBf4YxMnWMC[Domain Driven Design], draws a clear distinction between a factory (that creates object) and a repository (that is used to find existing objects).

On the other hand, from an end-users' perspective the act of finding an existing object vs creating a new one are quite closely related.
For this reason, in Apache Isis it's therefore quite common to have a single domain service that acts as both a factory and a repository (and is usually called just a "repository").

The behaviour of these services is rendered in various ways, though the most obvious is as the menu actions on the top-level menu bars in the xref:vw:ROOT:about.adoc[Wicket viewer]'s UI.

Domain services can also be used for a number of other purposes:

* to provide additional non-UI functionality; an example being to perform an address geocoding lookup against the google-maps API, or to perform some calculation, or attach a barcode, send an email etc

* to act as a subscribers to the event bus, potentially influencing events fired by some other module (a key technique for decoupling large applications) +
+
This is discussed in more detail below, in the section on xref:userguide:fun:building-blocks.adoc#events[events].

* to implement an link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_provider_interface[SPI] of the Apache Isis framework, most notably cross-cutting concerns such as security, command profiling, auditing and publishing.


Domain objects of any type (entities, other services, view models, mixins) can also delegate to domain services; domain services are automatically injected into every other domain object.
This injection of domain services into entities is significant: it allows business logic to be implemented in the domain entities, rather than have it "leach away" into
supporting service layers.
Said another way: it is the means by which Apache Isis helps you avoid the anaemic domain model anti-pattern.

Domain services are instantiated once and once only by the framework, and are used to centralize any domain logic that does not logically belong in a domain entity or value.

== Hexagonal Architecture

It's worth extending the xref:userguide:fun:core-concepts.adoc#hexagonal-architecture[Hexagonal Architecture] to show where domain services fit in:

image::core-concepts/philosophy/hexagonal-architecture-addons.png[width="700px",link="{imagesdir}/core-concepts/philosophy/hexagonal-architecture-addons.png"]

The xref:extensions:ROOT:about.adoc[extensions] catalog provide SPI implementations of the common cross-cutting concerns.
You can also write your own domain services as well, for example to interface with some external CMS system, say.
