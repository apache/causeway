TODO: this is out-of-date, can instead use Spring container.

As well as deploying an Apache Isis application into a servlet container, it is also possible to invoke from the command line using the `org.apache.isis.WebServer` utility class.
This is especially useful while developing and testing, but may also suit some deployment scenarios (eg running as a standalone EXE within a Docker container, for example).
Internally the `WebServer` spins up a Jetty servlet container.

The class also supports a number of command line arguments:

.Command line args for `org.apache.isis.Webserver`
[cols="1a,2a,2a,4a", options="header"]
|===
| Flag
| Long format
| Values +
(default)
| Description

|`-t`
|`--type`
|`server_prototype`, `server` +
(`server`)
|Deployment type


|`-m`
|`--manifest`
|FQCN
|Fully qualified class name of the xref:refguide:applib-cm:classes/super.adoc#AppManifest[`AppManifest`] to use to bootstrap the system. +

This flag sets/overrides the `isis.appManifest` configuration property to the specified class name.


|`-f`
|`--fixture`
|FQCN
|Fully qualified class name of the fixture (extending xref:refguide:applib-cm:classes/super.adoc#FixtureScript[`FixtureScript`]) to be run to setup data. +

This flag sets/overrides the `isis.fixtures` configuration property to the specified class name, and also sets the `isis.persistor.datanucleus.install-fixtures` configuration property to `true` to instruct the JDO/DataNucleus objectstore to actually load in the fixtures. +

It is also possible to specify the fixture class name using either the `$IsisFixture` or `$IsisFixtures` environment variable (case insensitive).

|`-p`
|`--port`
|(8080)
|The port number to listen on. +

This flag sets/overrides the `isis.embedded-web-server.port` configuration property.



|`-c`
|`--config`
|filename
|configuration file containing additional configuration properties



|`-D`
|
|xxx=yyy
|Specify additional arbitrary configuration properties.  This can be specified multiple times. +

Further discussion below.

|`-v`
|`--version`
|
|Prints the version, then quits



|`-h`
|`--help`
|
|Prints a usage message, then quits


|===


Note that the `-D` argument is *not* a system property, it is parsed by `WebServer` itself.  That said, it is _also_ possible to specify system properties, and these will also be processed in the exact same way. +

Said another way, properties can be specified either as application arguments:

[source,ini]
----
java org.apache.isis.WebServer -Dxxx=yyy -Daaa=bbb
----

or as system properties:

[source,ini]
----
java -Dxxx=yyy -Daaa=bbb org.apache.isis.WebServer
----






[TIP]
.The `Dummy` class
====
The framework also provides the `org.apache.isis.Dummy` class, which consists of a single empty `main(String[])` method.  It was introduced as a convenience for developers using Eclipse in combination with the DataNucleus plugin; if used as a launch target then it allow the entities to be enhanced withouth the running an app.
