The link:https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs[Google App Engine] (GAE) provides a JDO API, meaning that you can deploy Apache Isis onto GAE using the JDO objectstore.

However, GAE is not an RDBMS, and so there are some limitations that it imposes. This page gathers together various hints, tips and workarounds.




== Primary Keys and Owned/Unowned Relationships

All entities must have a `@PrimaryKey`. Within GAE, the type of this key matters.

For an entity to be an aggregate root, (ie a root of an GAE entity group), its key must be a `Long`, eg:

Any collection that holds this entity type (eg `ToDoItem#dependencies` holding a collection of ``ToDoItem``s) should then be annotated with `@Unowned` (a GAE annotation).

If on the other hand you want the object to be owned (through a 1:m relationship somewhere) by some other root, then use a String:

Note: if you store a relationship with a String key it means that the parent object _owns_ the child, any attempt to change the relationship raise and exception.





== Custom Types

Currently Apache Isis' `Blob` and `Clob` types and the JODA types (`LocalDate` et al) are _not_ supported in GAE.

Instead, GAE defines a link:https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/java/datastore/entities#Properties_and_Value_Types[fixed set of value types], including `BlobKey`. Members of the Apache Isis community have this working, though I haven't seen the code.

The above notwithstanding, Andy Jefferson at DataNucleus tells us:

pass:[<div class="extended-quote-first"><p>]GAE JDO/JPA does support _some_ type conversion, because looking at http://code.google.com/p/datanucleus-appengine/source/browse/trunk/src/com/google/appengine/datanucleus/StoreFieldManager.java#349[StoreFieldManager.java] for any field that is Object-based and not a relation nor Serialized it will call http://code.google.com/p/datanucleus-appengine/source/browse/trunk/src/com/google/appengine/datanucleus/TypeConversionUtils.java#736[TypeConverstionUtils.java] and that looks for a `TypeConverter` (specify `@Extension` with key of "type-converter-name" against a field and value as the `TypeConverter` class) and it should convert it. Similarly when getting the value from the datastore.
pass:[</p></div>]

On further investigation, it seems that the GAE implementation performs a type check on a `SUPPORTED_TYPES` Java set, in `com.google.appengine.api.datastore.DataTypeUtils`:

[source,java]
----
if (!supportedTypes.contains(value.getClass())) {
    throw new IllegalArgumentException(prefix + value.getClass().getName() + " is not a supported property type.");
}
----

We still need to try out Andy's recipe, above.
