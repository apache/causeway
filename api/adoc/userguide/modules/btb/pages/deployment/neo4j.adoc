Apache Isis has experimental support for Neo4J, courtesy of DataNucleus' http://www.datanucleus.org/products/datanucleus/datastores/neo4j.html[Neo4J Datastore] implementation.

//TODO: v2: need to port this over from http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-app-neoapp

[TIP]
====
The http://github.com/apache/isis-app-neoapp[neoapp] is configured to run with an embedded Neo4J server running alongside the Apache Isis webapp.
====

The steps below describe the configuration steps required to update an existing app.

== ConnectionURL

In `persistor.properties`, update the JDO `ConnectionURL` property, eg:

[source,ini]
----
isis.persistor.datanucleus.impl.javax.jdo.option.ConnectionURL=neo4j:neo4j_DB
----

The other connection properties (`ConnectionDriverName`, `ConnectionUserName` and `ConnectionPassword`) should be commented out.

== Update pom.xml

Add the following dependency to the `webapp` project's `pom.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<dependencies>
    ...
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.datanucleus</groupId>
        <artifactId>datanucleus-neo4j</artifactId>
        <version>4.0.5</version>                    <!--1-->
    </dependency>
    ...
</dependencies>
----
<1> for Isis v1.9.0, use the value shown.
For Isis v1.8.0, use 3.2.3.
