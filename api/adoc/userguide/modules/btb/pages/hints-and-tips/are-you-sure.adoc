Sometimes an action might perform irreversible changes.
In such a case it's probably a good idea for the UI to require that the end-user explicitly confirms that they intended to invoke the action.


One way to meet this requirement is using the framework's built-in xref:refguide:applib-ant:Action.adoc#semantics[`@Action#semantics`] attribute:

[source,java]
----
@Action(
        semantics = SemanticsOf.IDEMPOTENT_ARE_YOU_SURE
)
public SimpleObject updateName(
        @Parameter(maxLength = NAME_LENGTH)
        @ParameterLayout(named = "New name")
        final String name) {
    setName(name);
    return this;
}
----


This will render as:
