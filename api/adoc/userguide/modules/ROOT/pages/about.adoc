This guide introduces the xref:userguide:fun:concepts-patterns.adoc[core concepts] and then an xref:userguide:fun:overview.adoc[overview] of the building blocks of Apache Isis applications.

It next describes the basics of the Apache Isis' programming model: xref:userguide:fun:domain-entities-and-services.adoc[domain entities and services], xref:userguide:fun:object-pathsToInclude.adoc[object pathsToInclude], xref:userguide:fun:ui.adoc[UI layout and hints], xref:userguide:fun:business-rules.adoc[business rules] and xref:userguide:fun:drop-downs-and-defaults.adoc[drop downs and defaults].

It then moves on to discuss some slightly more advanced areas of the programming model: xref:userguide:fun:meta-annotations.adoc[meta-annotations], xref:userguide:fun:view-models.adoc[view models] and xref:userguide:fun:mixins.adoc[mixins].
These all allow you to develop more sophisticated applications, while remaining maintainable and elegant.

To finish up, there is a chapter on xref:userguide:fun:domain-entities-and-services.adoc#object-management-crud[CRUD] which runs through these basic operations, and a chapter explaining how to structure your application using xref:userguide:fun:modules.adoc[modules].

There is one further chapter, xref:userguide:btb:about.adoc[Beyond the Basics], which tackles more advanced topics.

As an appendix, the guide also references some of the extensions that you are likely to use often and routinely:

* xref:userguide:flyway:about.adoc[Flyway]
