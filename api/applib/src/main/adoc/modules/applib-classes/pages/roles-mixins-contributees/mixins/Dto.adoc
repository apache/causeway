The `Dto` role interface is intended to be implemented by JAXB-annotated view models, that is, annotated using
xref:refguide:applib-ant:XmlRootElement.adoc[`@XmlRootElement`].
It enables the ability to download the XML and XSD schema of those objects using two xref:userguide:fun:overview.adoc#mixins[mixins], `Dto_downloadXml` and `Dto_downloadXsd`.

The interface is just a marker interface (with no members), and is defined as:

[source,java]
----
public interface Dto { }
----

The `Dto_downloadXml` mixin defines the following action:

// TODO: v2: use include::[]

[source,java]
----
@Action
public class Dto_downloadXml {

    public Dto_downloadXml(final Dto dto) {     // <.>
        // ...
    }
    public Object act(final String fileName) {  // <.>
        // ...
    }

    // ...
}
----
<.> (constructor) provided as an action to any class that (trivially) implements the `Dto` interface
<.> The action's name is derived from the class name.

This will return the XML text wrapped up in a xref:applib-classes:about.adoc#Clob[`Clob`].

The `Dto_downloadXsd` mixin is similar:

[source,java]
----
@Action
public class Dto_downloadXsd {
    public Dto_downloadXsd(final Dto dto) { /* ... */ }  // <.>
    public Object act(                                   // <.>
            final String fileName,
            final IsisSchemes isisSchemas) { /* ... */ }
}
----
<.> (constructor) provided as an action to any class that (trivially) implements the `Dto` interface
<.> The action's name be derived from the class name.

If the domain object's JAXB annotations reference only a single XSD schema then this will return that XML text as a xref:applib-classes:about.adoc#Clob[`Clob`] of that XSD.
If there are multiple XSD schemas referenced then the action will return a zip of those schemas, wrapped up in a xref:applib-classes:about.adoc#Blob[`Blob`].
The `IsisSchemas` parameter to the action can be used to optionally ignore the common xref:refguide:schema:about.adoc[Apache Isis schemas] (useful if there is only one other XSD schema referenced by the DTO).

The `Dto_downloadXml` and `Dto_downloadXsd` delegate to the xref:refguide:applib:index/services/jaxb/JaxbService.adoc[`JaxbService`] to actually generate the XML/XSD.
