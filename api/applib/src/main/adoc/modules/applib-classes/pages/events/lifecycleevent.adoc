|xref:applib-classes:events.adoc#AbstractLifecycleEvent[`o.a.i.applib.` +
`AbstractLifecycleEvent`]
|(abstract class)
|Superclass of the other lifecycle events, listed below in this table.


|xref:applib-classes:events.adoc#ObjectCreatedEvent[`o.a.i.applib.` +
`ObjectCreatedEvent`]
|(abstract class). +
`ObjectCreatedEvent.Default` is the concrete implementation that is used.
|Broadcast when an object is first instantiated using the xref:refguide:applib:index/services/factory/FactoryService.adoc[`FactoryService`]'s
`#instantiate(...)` method.


|xref:applib-classes:events.adoc#ObjectLoadedEvent[`o.a.i.applib.` +
`ObjectLoadedEvent`]
|(abstract class). +
`ObjectLoadedEvent.Default` is the concrete implementation that is used.
|Broadcast when an object is retrieved from the database.


|xref:applib-classes:events.adoc#ObjectPersistedEvent[`o.a.i.applib.` +
`ObjectPersistedEvent`]
|(abstract class). +
`ObjectPersistedEvent.Default` is the concrete implementation that is used.
|Broadcast when an object is first saved (inserted) into the database using the xref:refguide:applib:index/services/repository/RepositoryService.adoc[`RepositoryService`]'s
`#persist(...)` method.


|xref:applib-classes:events.adoc#ObjectPersistingEvent[`o.a.i.applib.` +
`ObjectPersistingEvent`]
|(abstract class). +
`ObjectPersistingEvent.Default` is the concrete implementation that is used.
|Broadcast when an object is about to be saved (inserted) into the database using the xref:refguide:applib:index/services/repository/RepositoryService.adoc[`RepositoryService`]'s
`#persist(...)` method.


|xref:applib-classes:events.adoc#ObjectRemovingEvent[`o.a.i.applib.` +
`ObjectRemovingEvent`]
|(abstract class). +
`ObjectRemovingEvent.Default` is the concrete implementation that is used.
|Broadcast when an object is about to be deleted from the database using the xref:refguide:applib:index/services/repository/RepositoryService.adoc[`RepositoryService`]'s
`#remove(...)` method.


|xref:applib-classes:events.adoc#ObjectUpdatedEvent[`o.a.i.applib.` +
`ObjectUpdatedEvent`]
|(abstract class). +
`ObjectUpdatedEvent.Default` is the concrete implementation that is used.
|Broadcast when an object has just been updated in the database.
This is done either explicitly when the current transaction is flushed using the xref:refguide:applib:index/services/repository/RepositoryService.adoc[`RepositoryService`]'s `#flush(...)` method, else is done implicitly when the transaction commits at the end of the user request.


|xref:applib-classes:events.adoc#ObjectUpdatingEvent[`o.a.i.applib.` +
`ObjectUpdatingEvent`]
|``o.a.i.core`` +
``events.lifecycle`` +
``isis-applib``
|(abstract class). +
`ObjectUpdatingEvent.Default` is the concrete implementation that is used.
|Broadcast when an object is about to be updated in the database.
This is done either explicitly when the current transaction is flushed using the xref:refguide:applib:index/services/repository/RepositoryService.adoc[`RepositoryService`]'s `#flush(...)` method, else is done implicitly when the transaction commits at the end of the user request.
