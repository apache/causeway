The metadata APIs provide access to the framework's internal metamodel.  These are generally of use to support development-time activities, for example creating custom UIs through Swagger.

The table below summarizes the metadata APIs defined by Apache Isis.
It also lists their corresponding implementation, either a default implementation provided by Apache Isis itself, or provided by one of the (non-ASF) link:https://platform.incode.org[Incode Platform^] modules.

within the metamodel.

|`LayoutServiceDefault` +
``o.a.i.core`` +
``isis-core-metamodel``
|Functionality surfaced in the UI through related mixin and menu.




|xref:refguide:applib-svc:MetamodelService.adoc[`o.a.i.applib.` +
`services.metamodel` +
`MetaModelService`]
|Access to certain information from the Apache Isis metamodel.
|`MetaModelServiceDefault` +
``o.a.i.core`` +
``isis-core-metamodel``
|Functionality surfaced in the UI through related menu.

|xref:refguide:applib-svc:SwaggerService.adoc[`o.a.i.applib.` +
`services.swagger` +
`SwaggerService`]
|Generates link:http://swagger.io/[Swagger] spec files to describe the public and/or private RESTful APIs exposed by the xref:vro:ROOT:about.adoc[RestfulObjects viewer].  These can then be used with the link:http://swagger.io/swagger-ui/[Swagger UI] page to explore the REST API, or used to generate client-side stubs using the link:http://swagger.io/swagger-codegen/[Swagger codegen] tool, eg for use in a custom REST client app.
|`SwaggerServiceDefault` +
``o.a.i.core`` +
``isis-core-metamodel``
|A `SwaggerServiceMenu` domain service is also provided which enables the swagger spec to be downloaded.

// FIXME: currently removed in v2, may reinstate
//Apache Isis' xref:refguide:mvn:about.adoc[Maven plugin] also provides a xref:refguide:mvn:swagger.adoc[swagger goal] which allows the spec file(s) to be generated at build time (eg so that client-side stubs can then be generated in turn).
