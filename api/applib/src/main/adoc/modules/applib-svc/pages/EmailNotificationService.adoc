WARNING: TODO: this content has not yet been reviewed/updated for v2.0


The `EmailNotificationService` supports the xref:vw:ROOT:features.adoc#user-registration[user registration] (self sign-up) features of the xref:vw:ROOT:about.adoc[Wicket viewer] whereby a user can sign-up to access an application by providing a valid email address.

The Wicket viewer will check whether an implementation of this service (and also the xref:refguide:applib-svc:UserRegistrationService.adoc[`UserRegistrationService`]) is available, and if so will (unless configured not to) expose a sign-up page where the user enters their email address.
A verification email is sent using this service; the email includes a link back to the running application.
The user then completes the registration process (choosing a user name, password and so on) and the Wicket viewer creates an account for them (using the aforementioned `UserRegistrationService`).

The role of this service in all of this is to format and send out emails for the initial registration, or for password resets.

The default implementation of this service uses the xref:refguide:applib-svc:EmailService.adoc[`EmailService`], which must be configured in order for user registration to be enabled.

== SPI

The SPI defined by this service is:

[source,java]
----
include::refguide:applib-svc:example$services/userreg/EmailNotificationService.java[tags="refguide"]
----
<.> sends an email to verify an email address as part of the initial user registration
<.> sends an email to reset a password for an already-registered user
<.> determines whether the implementation was configured and initialized correctly

If `isConfigured()` returns false then it is _not_ valid to call `send(...)` (and doing so will result in an `IllegalStateException` being thrown).

== Implementation

The framework provides a default implementation, `o.a.i.core.runtime.services.userreg.EmailNotificationServiceDefault`
that constructs the emails to send.

=== Alternatives

The text of these email templates is hard-coded as resources, in other words baked into the core jar files.
If you need to use different text then you can of course always write and register your own implementation to be used instead of Isis' default.

If you have configured an alternative email service implementation, it should process the message body as HTML.

If you wish to write an alternative implementation of this service, note that (unlike most Apache Isis domain services) the implementation is also instantiated and injected by Google Guice.
This is because `EmailNotificationService` is used as part of the xref:vw:ROOT:features.adoc#user-registration[user registration] functionality and is used by Wicket pages that are accessed outside of the usual Apache Isis runtime.

This implies a couple of additional constraints:

* first, implementation class should also be annotated with `@com.google.inject.Singleton`

* second, there may not be any Apache Isis session running.
(If necessary, one can be created on the fly using `IsisContext.doInSession(...)`)

== Related Services

As noted elsewhere, the default implementation of this service uses xref:refguide:applib-svc:EmailService.adoc[`EmailService`].
This service has no specific configuration properties but does require that the `EmailService` has been configured.

Conversely, this service is used by (Isis' default implementation of) xref:refguide:applib-svc:UserRegistrationService.adoc[`UserRegistrationService`].
