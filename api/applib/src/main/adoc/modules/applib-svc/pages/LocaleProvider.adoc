WARNING: TODO: this content has not yet been reviewed/updated for v2.0


The `LocaleProvider` service is one of the services that work together to implement Apache Isis' support for i18n, being used by Isis' default implementation of xref:refguide:applib-svc:TranslationService.adoc[`TranslationService`].

The role of the service itself is simply to return the `Locale` of the current user.

[NOTE]
====
For the "big picture" and further details on Apache Isis' i18n support, see xref:userguide:btb:i18n.adoc[here].

================================

== SPI

The SPI defined by this service is:

[source,java]
----
include::refguide:applib-svc:example$services/i18n/LocaleProvider.java[tags="refguide"]
----

This is notionally request-scoped, returning the `Locale` of the current user; _not_ that of the server.
(Note that the implementation does not required any special scoping such as xref:refguide:applib-ant:InteractionScope.adoc[`@IsisSessionScope`], for example).


================================

== Implementation

Isis' xref:vw:ROOT:about.adoc[Wicket viewer] provides an implementation of this service (`LocaleProviderWicket`) which leverages Apache Wicket APIs.

[NOTE]
====
Currently there is no equivalent implementation for the xref:vro:ROOT:about.adoc[RestfulObjects viewer].
====

== Related Services

This service works in conjunction with xref:refguide:applib-svc:TranslationService.adoc[`TranslationService`] and xref:refguide:applib-svc:TranslationsResolver.adoc[`TranslationsResolver`] in order to provide i18n support.
