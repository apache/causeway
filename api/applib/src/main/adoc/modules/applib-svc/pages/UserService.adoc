WARNING: TODO: this content has not yet been reviewed/updated for v2.0

The `UserService` allows the domain object to obtain the identity of the user interacting with said object.

If xref:refguide:applib-svc:SudoService.adoc[`SudoService`] has been used to temporarily override the user and/or roles, then this service will report the overridden values instead.

[WARNING]
================================

== API and Usage

The API of `UserService` is:

[source,java]
----
include::refguide:applib-svc:example$services/user/UserService.java[tags="refguide"]
----

where in turn `UserMemento` is:

[source,java]
----
include::refguide:applib-svc:example$services/user/UserMemento.java[tags="refguide"]
----

and `RoleMemento` is still:

[source,java]
----
include::refguide:applib-svc:example$services/user/RoleMemento.java[tags="refguide"]
----

The roles associated with the `UserMemento` will be based on the configured xref:security:ROOT:about.adoc[security] (typically Shiro).

In addition, when using the xref:vw:ROOT:about.adoc[Wicket viewer] there will be an additional "org.apache.isis.viewer.wicket.roles.USER" role; this is used internally to restrict access to web pages without authenticating.





================================

== Implementation

The core framework provides a default implementation of this service (`o.a.i.core.runtime.services.user.UserServiceDefault`).
