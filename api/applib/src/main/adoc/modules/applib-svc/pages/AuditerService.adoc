The `AuditerService` auditing service provides a simple mechanism to capture changes to data.
It is called for each property that has changed on any domain object, as a set of pre- and post-values.

== SPI

The SPI for the service is:

[source,java]
----
include::refguide:applib-svc:example$services/audit/AuditerService.java[tag=refguide]
----
<1> whether this implementation is enabled.
If all configured implementations are disabled, then auditing is suppressed (a minor performance optimization).
<2> together the `transactionId` (misnamed; really is the request/interaction Id) and the `sequence` uniquely identify the transaction in which the object was changed.
<3> identifies the object that has changed
<4> the property of the object that has changed.
The combination of the `transactionId`, `sequence`, `target` and `propertyName` is unique.
<5> the before and after values of the property (in string format).
If the object was created then "[NEW]" is used as the pre-value; if the object was deleted then "[DELETED]" is used as the post-value.
<6> the user that changed the object, and the date/time that this occurred.

The framework will call this for each and every domain object property that is modified within a transaction.

== Implementations

The framework allows multiple implementations of this service to be registered; all will be called.

There are two implementations provided by the framework:

* The core framework provides a fallback implementation, `o.a.i.applib.services.audit.AuditerServiceLogging`.
This simply logs the messages using a link:https://logging.apache.org/log4j/log4j-2.2/manual/configuration.html[Log4j2] logger.

See the `log4j2-spring.xml` file in xref:docs:starters:simpleapp.adoc[simpleapp] for the omitted detail.

* the xref:security:audit-trail:about.adoc[Audit Trail] extension persists each audit record in a relational table.
As its name implies, it uses xref:pjdo:ROOT:about.adoc[JDO/DataNucleus] to do this.


== Related Services

The services provided by this module combines very well with the xref:refguide:applib-svc:CommandService.adoc[`CommandService`].
The `CommandService` captures the __cause__ of an interaction (an action was invoked, a property was edited), while the `AuditerService` captures the __effect__ of that interaction in terms of changed state.
You may also want to configure the xref:refguide:applib-svc:PublisherService.adoc[`PublisherService`], which also captures the effect of the interaction but as an event.
All three of these services collaborate implicitly by way of the xref:refguide:applib-cm:classes/mixins.adoc#HasUniqueId[`HasUniqueId`] interface.
