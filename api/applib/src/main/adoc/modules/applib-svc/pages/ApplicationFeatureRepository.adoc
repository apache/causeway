// TODO - v2 to reconcile with .java (or maybe just delete)

//where `ApplicationMemberType` in turn is:
//
//[source,java]
//----
//include::refguide:applib-svc:example$services/appfeat/ApplicationMemberType.java[tags=refguide]
//----
//
//These methods are designed primarily to return lists of strings for use in drop-downs.



== Implementation

The core framework (xref:core:metamodel:about.adoc[MetaModel] module) provides a default implementation, `o.a.i.core.metamodel.services.appfeat.ApplicationFeatureRepositoryDefault`.

This implementation supports the following configuration properties:

* xref:refguide:config:sections/isis.core.runtime-services.adoc#isis.core.runtime-services.application-features.init[`isis.core.runtime-services.application-features.init`]


== Related Services

The default implementation of this service uses the internal xref:core:runtime-services:ApplicationFeatureFactory.adoc[`ApplicationFeatureFactory`] service to instantiate `ApplicationFeature` instances.
