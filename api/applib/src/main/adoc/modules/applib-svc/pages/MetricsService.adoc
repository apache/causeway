WARNING: TODO: this content has not yet been reviewed/updated for v2.0

The `MetricsService` is an xref:refguide:applib-ant:InteractionScope.adoc[`IsisSessionScope`]d domain service that hooks into the JDO/DataNucleus ObjectStore to provide a number of counters relating to numbers of object loaded, dirtied etc.

The service tracks entity change metrics for those entities that have `entityChangePublishing` enabled.

[WARNING]
================================

== API

The API of the service is:

[source,java]
----
include::refguide:applib-svc:example$services/metrics/MetricsService.java[tags="refguide"]
----
<.> The number of objects that have, so far in this request, been loaded from the database.
<.> The number of objects that have, so far in this request, been dirtied/will need updating in the database); a good measure of the footprint of the interaction.



================================

== Implementation

The framework provides persistence layer specific implementations of this API:

- `o.a.i.**.MetricsServiceForJdo`
- `o.a.i.**.MetricsServiceForJpa`



== Related Services

The xref:refguide:applib-svc:ExecutionSubscriber.adoc[`PublisherService`] also captures the metrics gathered by the `MetricsService` and publishes them as part of the `PublishedObjects` class (part of its SPI).
