The `UrlEncodingService` defines a consistent way to convert strings to/from a form safe for use within a URL.
The service is used by the framework to map xref:userguide:fun:overview.adoc#view-models[view model] mementos (derived from the state of the view model itself) into a form that can be used as a view model.
When the framework needs to recreate the view model (for example to invoke an action on it), this URL is converted back into a view model memento, from which the view model can then be hydrated.

Defining this functionality as an SPI has two use cases:

* first, (though some browsers support longer strings), there is a limit of 2083 characters for URLs.
For view model mementos that correspond to large strings (as might occur when serializing a JAXB xref:refguide:applib-ant:XmlRootElement.adoc[`@XmlRootElement`]-annotated view model), the service provides a hook.
+
For example, each memento string could be mapped to a GUID held in some cluster-aware cache.

* the service provides the ability, to encrypt the string in order to avoid leakage of potentially sensitive state within the URL.

The framework provides a default implementation of this service, `UrlEncodingServiceWithCompression`, discussed further in the section below.

[WARNING]
================================

== SPI

The SPI defined by the service is:

[source,java]
----
include::refguide:applib-svc:example$services/urlencoding/UrlEncodingService.java[tags="refguide"]
----
<.> convert the string (eg view model memento) into a string safe for use within an URL

<.> unconvert the string from its URL form into its original form URL





================================

== Implementation

The framework provides a default implementation, `o.a.i.core.runtimeservices.urlencoding.UrlEncodingServiceWithCompression`, that first (gzip) compresses the state and then uses `base-64` encoding of the resulting bytes.
As already noted, be aware that the maximum length of a URL should not exceed 2083 characters.
For large view models, there's the possibility that this limit could be exceeded; in such cases register an alternative implementation of this service.

The applib also provides `UrlEncodingServiceUsingBaseEncodingAbstract`, which is provided as a convenient base class for alternative implementations.
