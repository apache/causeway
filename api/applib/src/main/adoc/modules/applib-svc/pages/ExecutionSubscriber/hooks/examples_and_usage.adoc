== Wrapper Factory

If the xref:refguide:applib-svc:WrapperFactory.adoc[`WrapperFactory`] is used to call other objects then the metrics are captured for each sub-execution.

See also:

* the xref:refguide:applib-svc:InteractionContext.adoc[`InteractionContext`] is used to obtain the `Interaction` from which the member executions are published.

* the xref:system:generated:index/applib/services/publishing/spi/EntityChangesSubscriber.adoc[EntityChangesSubscriber] is used to obtain the set of objects modified within the interaction

* the xref:refguide:applib-svc:MetricsService.adoc[`MetricsService`] is used to obtain the objects that are loaded throughout the transaction; this info is used in order to instantiate the xref:system:generated:index/applib/services/publishing/spi/EntityChanges.adoc[EntityChanges] object passed through to the xref:system:generated:index/applib/services/publishing/spi/EntityChangesSubscriber.adoc[EntityChangesSubscriber].

* The services provided by this module combine very well with the xref:system:generated:index/applib/services/publishing/spi/CommandSubscriber.adoc[CommandSubscriber] and with xref:system:generated:index/applib/services/publishing/spi/EntityPropertyChangeSubscriber.adoc[EntityPropertyChangeSubscriber].

The xref:system:generated:index/applib/services/command/Command.adoc[Command]  captures the __cause__ of an interaction (an action was invoked, a property was edited), while the xref:system:generated:index/applib/services/publishing/spi/ExecutionSubscriber.adoc[ExecutionSubscriber] captures the __effect__ of that interaction in terms of events, while the xref:system:generated:index/applib/services/publishing/spi/EntityPropertyChangeSubscriber.adoc[EntityPropertyChangeSubscriber] captures the effect of the interaction in terms of changed state.

All of these services collaborate implicitly by way of the xref:system:generated:index/commons/having/HasUniqueId.adoc[HasUniqueId] interface.

In contrast:

* The xref:system:generated:index/applib/services/eventbus/EventBusService.adoc[EventBusService] differs from the xref:system:generated:index/applib/services/publishing/spi/ExecutionSubscriber.adoc[ExecutionSubscriber] in that the former is intended for fine-grained publish/subscribe for object-to-object interactions _within_ an Apache Isis domain object model.
+
The event propagation is strictly in-memory, and there are no restrictions on the object acting as the event; it need not be serializable, for example.
