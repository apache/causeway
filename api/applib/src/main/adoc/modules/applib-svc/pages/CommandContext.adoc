CAUTION: TODO v2 - to update, has been removed so that instead Interaction holds the Command, which in turn is accessed from InteractionContext.

The `CommandContext` service is a xref:refguide:applib-ant:IsisSessionScope.adoc[request-scoped] service that reifies the invocation of an action on a domain object into an object itself.
This reified information is encapsulated within the xref:CommandContext.adoc#command[`Command`] object.

By default, the command is held in-memory only; once the action invocation has completed, the command object is gone.
The optional supporting xref:refguide:applib-svc:CommandService.adoc[`CommandService`] enables the implementation of xref:CommandContext.adoc#command[`Command`] to be pluggable.
With an appropriate implementation
// TODO: v2: update for extensions (eg as provided by the (non-ASF) link:https://platform.incode.org[Incode Platform^]'s command module's xref:refguide:applib-svc:CommandService.adoc[`CommandService`])
the xref:CommandContext.adoc#command[`Command`] instance may then be persisted.

There are two main use cases:

* to allow invocation of ``Command``s to be deferred, for example to be invoked in the background

* to allow ``Command``s to be replicated and replayed to another system (usually for testing or dual-running/migration purposes).

This is normally done using the `CommandWithDto` subtype, that can return a representation of the `Command` as an XML instance of the xref:refguide:schema:cmd.adoc[`cmd.xsd`] schema, which also captures a unique transactionId (GUID) for the command.











== API

The `CommandContext` request-scoped service defines the following very simple API:

[source,java]
----
include::refguide:applib-svc:example$services/command/CommandContext.java[tags="refguide"]
----

=== `Command`

The `Command` type in turn is defined as:

[source,java]
----
include::refguide:applib-svc:example$services/command/Command.java[tags="refguide"]
----

<.> user that initiated the action.
<.> date/time at which this action was created.
<.> bookmark of the target object (entity or service) on which this action was performed
<.> holds a string representation of the invoked action
<.> human-friendly description of the class of the target object
<.> human-friendly name of the action invoked on the target object
<.> human-friendly description of the arguments with which the action was invoked <.> formal (XML or similar) specification of the action to invoke/being invoked
<.> whether this command is executed in the foreground or background
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::refguide:applib-ant:example$annotation/CommandExecuteIn.java[tags="refguide"]
----

<.> the (current) executor of this command:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::refguide:applib-svc:example$services/command/Command.java[tags="refguide2"]
----

<.> date/time at which this action started (same as `timestamp` property for foreground commands) <.> date/time at which this action completed.
<.> for actions created through the `BackgroundService`, captures the parent action <.> exception stack trace, if action threw exception <.> bookmark to object returned by action, if any <.> the policy controlling whether this command should ultimately be persisted:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::refguide:applib-ant:example$annotation/CommandPersistence.java[tags="refguide"]
----

<.> whether that the command should be persisted, if persistence policy is "if hinted".

== Implementation

The `o.a.i.applib.services.command.CommandContext` is also the default implementation of the service.

The implementation of `Command` will provided by the xref:refguide:applib-svc:CommandService.adoc[`CommandService`] SPI.

== Usage

The typical way to indicate that an action should be treated as a command is to annotate it with the xref:refguide:applib-ant:Action.adoc#command[`@Action#command()`] annotation.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class ToDoItem ... {
    @Action(command=CommandReification.ENABLED)
    public ToDoItem completed() { /* ... */ }
}
----

As an alternative to annotating every action with xref:refguide:applib-ant:Action.adoc#command[`@Action#command()`], use the xref:refguide:config:sections/isis.applib.adoc#isis.applib.annotation.action.command[`isis.applib.annotation.action.command`] to define a global default.





== Interacting with the services

Typically domain objects will have little need to interact with the `CommandContext` and `Command` directly; what is more useful is that these are persisted in support of the various use cases identified above.

One case however where a domain object might want to obtain the `Command` is to determine whether it has been invoked in the foreground, or in the background.
It can do this using the `getExecutedIn()` method:

Although not often needed, this then allows the domain object to access the `Command` object through the `CommandContext` service.
To expand the above example:

[source,java]
----
public class ToDoItem ... {
    @Action(
        command=CommandReification.ENABLED,
        commandExecuteIn=CommandExecuteIn.BACKGROUND
    )
    public ToDoItem completed() {
        ...
        Command currentCommand = commandContext.getCommand();
        ...
    }
    @Inject
    CommandContext commandContext;
}
----


//If run in the background, it might then notify the user (eg by email) if all work is done.
//
//This leads us onto a related point, distinguishing the current effective user vs the originating "real" user.
//When running in the foreground, the current user can be obtained from the xref:refguide:applib-svc:UserService.adoc[`UserService`], using:
//
//[source,java]
//----
//String user = userService.getUser().getName();
//----
//
//If running in the background, however, then the current user will be the credentials of the background process, for example as run by a Quartz scheduler job.
//
//The domain object can still obtain the original ("effective") user that caused the job to be created, using:
//
//[source,java]
//----
//String user = commandContext.getCommand().getUser();
//----





== Related Services

The implementation of xref:refguide:applib-svc:CommandContext.adoc#command[`Command`] is provided by the xref:refguide:applib-svc:CommandService.adoc[`CommandService`].
The default implementation of that service creates an in-memory instance, but other implementations might choose to persist the `Command`, eg so its execution can be deferred, or replayed.


The xref:refguide:applib-svc:CommandContext.adoc[`CommandContext`] service itself is very similar in nature to the xref:refguide:applib-svc:InteractionContext.adoc[`InteractionContext`], in that the `Command` object accessed through it is very similar to the xref:refguide:applib-svc:InteractionContext.adoc#interaction[`Interaction`] object obtained from the `InteractionContext`.
The principle distinction is that while `Command` represents the __intention__ to invoke an action or edit a property, the `Interaction` (and contained ``Execution``s) represents the actual execution.



``Command``s are often combined with implementations of the xref:refguide:applib-svc:PublisherService.adoc[`PublisherService`] and sometimes also the xref:refguide:applib-svc:AuditerService.adoc[`AuditerService`]:

* the `PublisherService` publishes interactions as they have is configured, they provide better traceability as the `Command` is also correlated with any published events, again through the unique `transactionId` GUID
* if a `AuditerService` is configured, they provide better audit information, since the `Command` (the 'cause' of an action) can be correlated to the audit records (the "effect" of the action) through the `transactionId` GUID
