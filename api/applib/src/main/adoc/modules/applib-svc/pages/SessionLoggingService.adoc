WARNING: TODO: this content has not yet been reviewed/updated for v2.0

The `SessionLoggingService` defines an SPI to keep track of (typically: to log) the current sessions that are using the application.

Multiple implementations can be registered; all will be called.

[WARNING]
================================

== SPI

The SPI defined by this service is:

[source,java]
----
include::refguide:applib-svc:example$services/session/SessionLoggingService.java[tags="refguide"]
----
<.> an internal identifier (the JVM hashCode of the Wicket session).





================================

== Implementations

The framework provides a default implementation, `o.a.i.applib.services.session.SessionLoggingServiceLogging` that logs using log4j2.



//The (non-ASF) link:https://platform.incode.org[Incode Platform^]'s sessionlogger module provides an implementation that logs each session as a JDO entity.
