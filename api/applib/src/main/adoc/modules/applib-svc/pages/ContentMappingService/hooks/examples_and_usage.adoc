== Usage

// TODO: v2: this is an SPI, so maybe restfulobjects should define an "spi" module for this.

The `ContentMappingService` supports the (default implementation of the) internal xref:core:runtime-services:ContentNegotiationService.adoc[`ContentNegotiationService`] SPI enabling the xref:vro:ROOT:about.adoc[RestfulObjects viewer] to represent domain objects in some other format as specified by the HTTP `Accept` header.

For its part, the (default implementation of the) `ContentNegotiationService` will check _all_ available implementations of `ContentMappingService` to convert the domain object to the requested media type, rather than merely the first implementation found; in other words it uses the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain-of-responsibility_pattern[chain-of-responsibility] pattern.
Services are checked in the ordering defined by the Spring link:https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/annotation/Order.html[`@Order`] annotation.
The mapped object used will be the first non-`null` result returned by an implementation.


== Related Services

This service is a companion to the default implementation of the xref:core:runtime-services:ContentNegotiationService.adoc[`ContentNegotiationService`].

The framework implementations of `ContentMappingService` use the xref:refguide:applib-svc:MetamodelService.adoc[`MetaModelService`] to lookup any custom implementations of `CommandDtoProcessor`.
