== Usage

Most applications deal with dates and times in one way or another.
For example, if an `Order` is placed, then the `Customer` may have 30 days to pay the `Invoice`, otherwise a penalty may be levied.

However, such date/time related functionality can quickly complicate automated testing: "today+30" will be a different value every time the test is run.

Even disregarding testing, there may be a requirement to ensure that date/times are obtained from an NNTP server (rather than the system PC).
While instantiating a `java.util.Date` to current the current time is painless enough, we would not want complex technical logic for querying an NNTP server spread around domain logic code.

Therefore it's common to provide a domain service whose responsibility is to provide the current time.
This service can be injected into any domain object (and can be mocked out for unit testing).
Apache Isis provides such a facade through the `ClockService`.
