The `CommandDtoProcessorService` domain serviceproviding a mechanism to convert the  instance of `Command` into a serializable `CommandDto`.

Having a DTO representation of `Command` offers the ability to move or copy it across the network, for example to support replay scenarios.
To facilitate this, the framework itself provides a default implementation of this service which copies the publicly accessible members of `Command` into the corresponding `CommandDto`.

This is used by xref:refguide:applib-svc:ContentMappingService.adoc[`ContentMappingService`] to serialize ``Command``s over the REST API provided by xref:vro:ROOT:about.adoc[Restful Objects viewer].
For many cases this default implementation will suffice.

If necessary, though, a custom implementation of this service can be provided.
For example, if a custom implementation of xref:refguide:applib-svc:CommandService.adoc[`CommandService`] provides a different implementation of `Command` with additional state, this could be copied into the `userData` map of `CommandDto` using a companion implementation of the `CommandDtoProcessorService` may be provided in order to copy over any important additional properties.

WARNING: TODO: v2 - perhaps this should just be merged into `CommandService`?  (And for that matter, maybe the `BackgroundCommandService` also?)


== API

The API defined by `CommandDtoProcessorService` is:

[source,java]
----
include::refguide:applib-svc:example$services/commanddto/processor/spi/CommandDtoProcessorService.java[tags="refguide"]
----


== Implementation

As noted in the introduction, the framework provides a default implementation, namely `o.a.i.applib.services.conmap.command.ContentMappingServiceForCommandDto.CopyOverFromCommand`.


== Related Classes

The `CommandDtoProcessorService` is a global fallback for serializing actions of commands into a DTO.
However, this can be overridden on an action-by-action basis using  xref:refguide:applib-ant:Action.adoc#commanddtoprocessor[`@Action#commandDtoProcessor`].
The main use case is to allow certain actions to be ignored.

[source,java]
----
include::refguide:applib-svc:example$services/commanddto/processor/CommandDtoProcessor.java[tags="refguide"]
----
<.> Returning `null` means that the command's DTO is effectively ignored.

== Related Services

* the `CommandDtoProcessorService` is used by xref:refguide:applib-svc:ContentMappingService.adoc[`ContentMappingService`] to serialize ``Command``s over the REST API provided by xref:vro:ROOT:about.adoc[Restful Objects viewer].
All implementations are used.

* if there is a custom implementations of xref:refguide:applib-svc:CommandService.adoc[`CommandService`] (with a corresponding custom implementation of `Command`), then it may define a corresponding implementation of this `CommandDtoProcessorService` in order to serialize out any additional state.
