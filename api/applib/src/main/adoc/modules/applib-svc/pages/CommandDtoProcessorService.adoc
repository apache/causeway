Having a DTO representation of ``Command``s (or more precisely, any object implementing `HasCommandDto` offers the ability to move or copy it across the network, for example to support replay scenarios.
This is used for example by xref:extensions:command-log:about.adoc[Command Log] extension to return persisted representations of commands.
The conversion is performed by an in-built implementation of the xref:refguide:applib-svc:ContentMappingService.adoc[`ContentMappingService`] SPI.

The `CommandDtoProcessorService` SPI provides a mechanism to post-process the `CommandDto` of any objects being serialized across the network.

For example, the xref:extensions:command-replay:about.adoc[Command Replay] extension provides an implementation in order to copy information about the outcome of each command on the primary system into the `userData` map of `CommandDto`.
Another use case is to strip out large blobs for performance reasons.

The `CommandDtoProcessorService` is a global fallback for serializing actions of commands into a DTO.
However, this can be overridden on on an action-by-action basis using  xref:refguide:applib-ant:Action.adoc[`@Action#commandDtoProcessor`], and on a property-by-property basis using xref:refguide:applib-ant:Property.adoc[`@Command#commandDtoProcessor()`].
The main use case is to allow certain actions/property edits to be ignored:
