WARNING: TODO: this content has not yet been reviewed/updated for v2.0

The `MessageService` allows domain objects to raise information, warning or error messages.
These messages can either be simple strings, or can be translated.

[WARNING]
================================

== API and Usage

The API of `MessageService` is:

[source,java]
----
include::refguide:applib-svc:example$services/message/MessageService.java[tags="refguide"]
----
<.> display as a transient message to the user (not requiring acknowledgement).  In the xref:vw:ROOT:about.adoc[Wicket viewer] this is implemented as a toast that automatically disappears after a period of time.
<.> ditto, but with translatable string, for xref:userguide:btb:i18n.adoc[i18n support].
<.> ditto, but with an arbitrary translation context (rather than one inferred from a context class and method)
<.> warn the user about a situation with the specified message.  In the xref:vw:ROOT:about.adoc[Wicket viewer] this is implemented as a toast that must be closed by the end-user.
<.> ditto, but with translatable string, for i18n support.
<.> ditto, but with an arbitrary translation context (rather than one inferred from a context class and method)
<.> show the user an unexpected application error.  In the xref:vw:ROOT:about.adoc[Wicket viewer] this is implemented as a toast (with a different colour) that must be closed by the end-user.
<.> ditto, but with translatable string, for i18n support.
<.> ditto, but with an arbitrary translation context (rather than one inferred from a context class and method)

The i18n versions of these methods that take `contextClass` and `contextMethod` parameters use this to create a context string, eg "com.mycompany.Customer#placeOrder".



================================

== Implementation

The core framework provides a default implementation of this service, `o.a.i.core.runtime.services.message.MessageServiceDefault`.



== Usage

For example:

[source,java]
----
public Order addItem(Product product, @ParameterLayout(named="Quantity") int quantity) {
    if(productRepository.stockLevel(product) == 0) {
        messageService.warnUser(
            product.getDescription() + " out of stock; order fulfillment may be delayed");
    }
    ...
}
