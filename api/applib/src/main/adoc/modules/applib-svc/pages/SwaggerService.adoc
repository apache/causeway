WARNING: TODO: this content has not yet been reviewed/updated for v2.0

The `SwaggerService` generates link:http://swagger.io/[Swagger] spec files to describe the public and/or private RESTful APIs exposed by the xref:vro:ROOT:about.adoc[RestfulObjects viewer].

These spec files can then be used with the link:http://swagger.io/swagger-ui/[Swagger UI] page to explore the REST API, or used to generate client-side stubs using the link:http://swagger.io/swagger-codegen/[Swagger codegen] tool, eg for use in a custom REST client app.

[NOTE]
====
Not all of the REST API exposed by the xref:vro:ROOT:about.adoc[Restful Objects viewer] is included in the Swagger schema definition files; the emphasis is those REST resources that are used to develop custom apps: domain objects, domain object collections and action invocations.
When combined with Apache Isis' own xref:vro:ROOT:simplified-representations.adoc[simplified representations], these are pretty much all that is needed  for this use case.

================================

== API

The API defined by `SwaggerService` is:

[source,java]
----
include::refguide:applib-svc:example$services/swagger/SwaggerService.java[tags="refguide"]
----
<.> Generate a Swagger spec with the specified visibility and format (discussed below).

<.> `PUBLIC` Produces a limited spec for use by third-party clients, ie public use.
This specification is restricted only to
xref:userguide:fun:overview.adoc#view-models[view model]s and to domain services with a xref:refguide:applib-ant:DomainService.adoc#nature[nature] of `VIEW_REST_ONLY`.
<.> `PRIVATE` Produces a more complete spec, for internally-managed clients, ie private internal use.
This specification includes domain entities and all menu domain services (as well as any view models).
<.> `PRIVATE_WITH_PROTOTYPING` Ditto, but also including any xref:refguide:applib-ant:Action.adoc#restrictTo[prototype] actions.

<.> Generate as JSON...
<.> \... or as YAML.


================================

=== _PUBLIC_ vs _PRIVATE_ vs _PROTOTYPING_

`PUBLIC` only exposes actions which return _view models_, not _entities_.

That's because exposing entities would couple the REST client too deeply to the server implementation.
The idea here is that the REST client of a public API is 3rd party, in other words not under the control
of the author of the Apache Isis application.

The `PRIVATE` option removes this constraint, and does expose entities as well as view models.
This is for cases where the team developing the REST client is the same as the team developing
the backend isis service ... in other words its a private implementation detail of an application.

`PRIVATE_WITH_PROTOTYPING` is same as `PRIVATE`, but also exposes any prototype actions.


== Implementation

Apache Isis provides a default implementation of the service, `o.a.i.core.metamodel.services.swagger.SwaggerServiceDefault`.



== Usage within the framework

This service is provided as a convenience for applications, it is not (currently) used by the framework itself.




== Related Services

A `SwaggerServiceMenu` domain service (part of the xref:vro:ROOT:about.adoc[Restful Objects viewer]) provides a prototype action that enables the swagger spec to be downloaded from theUI.

// FIXME: currently removed in v2, may reinstate
//Apache Isis' xref:refguide:mvn:about.adoc[Maven plugin] also provides a xref:refguide:mvn:swagger.adoc[swagger goal] which allows the spec file(s) to be generated at build time.
//This then allows client-side stubs can then be generated in turn as part of a build pipeline.
