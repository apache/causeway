The `QueryResultsCacheControl` domain service is used to enable or disable caching by xref:refguide:applib-svc:QueryResultsCache.adoc[`QueryResultsCache`].


== API

The API for this service is simply:

[source,java]
----
include::refguide:applib-svc:example$services/queryresultscache/QueryResultCacheControl.java[tags="refguide"]
----

== Implementation

The xref:testing:fixtures:about.adoc[fixtures module] provides an implementation, `o.a.i.testing.fixtures.applib.queryresultscache.QueryResultsCacheControlDefault`.
This will cause the cache to be ignored while fixtures are being installed.
