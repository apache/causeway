The `CommandService` service supports the xref:refguide:applib-svc:CommandContext.adoc[`CommandContext`] service such that xref:refguide:applib-svc:CommandContext.adoc#command[`Command`] objects (that reify the invocation of an action/edit of a property on a domain object) can be persisted.

//The primary use case for persistent ``Command``s is in support of background commands; they act as a parent to any background commands that can be persisted either explicitly using the xref:refguide:applib-svc:BackgroundService.adoc[`BackgroundService`], or implicitly by way of the xref:refguide:applib-ant:Action.adoc#command[`@Action#command()`] annotation.

``Command``s
//also
support the ability to replicate from a master to a slave instance of an application.
One use case for this is for regression testing, allowing a production usages to be replayed against a new release candidate, eg after upgrading that application to a new version of Apache Isis itself (or some other dependency).

There are a number of related use cases:

* they enable profiling of the running application (which actions are invoked then most often, what is their response time)


* if xref:refguide:applib-svc:PublisherService.adoc[`PublisherService`] is configured, they provide
better traceability as the `Command` is also correlated with any published events, again through the unique
`transactionId` GUID
* if xref:refguide:applib-svc:AuditerService.adoc[`AuditerService`](s) are configured, they provide better audit
information, since the `Command` (the 'cause' of an action) can be correlated to the audit records (the "effect" of
the action) through the `transactionId` GUID




== SPI

The `CommandService` service defines the following very simple API:

[source,java]
----
include::refguide:applib-svc:example$services/command/spi/CommandService.java[tags="refguide"]
----
<.> Instantiate the appropriate instance of the xref:refguide:applib-svc:CommandContext.adoc#command[`Command`] (as defined by the
xref:refguide:applib-svc:CommandContext.adoc[`CommandContext`] service).
Its members will be populated automatically by the framework.
<.> Set the hint that the `Command` should be persisted if possible (when completed, see below).
<.> "Complete" the command, typically meaning that the command should be persisted it if its `Command#getPersistence()` flag and persistence hint (`Command#isPersistHint()`) indicate that it should be.  +
+
The framework will automatically have set the `completedAt` property of the `Command`.



== Implementation

The xref:extensions:command-log:about.adoc[Command Log] extension provides an implementation of this service that persists commands to a database table.


== Related Services

As discussed above, this service supports the xref:refguide:applib-svc:CommandContext.adoc[`CommandContext`], providing the ability for `Command` objects to be persisted.
//This is closely related to the xref:refguide:applib-svc:_BackgroundCommandService.adoc[`BackgroundCommandService`]that allows the xref:refguide:applib-svc:BackgroundService.adoc[`BackgroundService`] to schedule commands for background/asynchronous execution.

//The implementations of `CommandService` and `BackgroundCommandService` are intended to go together, so that persistent parent `Command`s can be associated with their child background `Command`s.

The services provided by this module combines very well with the xref:refguide:applib-svc:AuditerService.adoc[`AuditerService`].
The `CommandService` captures the __cause__ of an interaction (an action was invoked, a property was edited), while the `AuditerService` captures the __effect__ of that interaction in terms of changed state.
You may also want to configure the xref:refguide:applib-svc:PublisherService.adoc[`PublisherService`], which also captures the effect of the interaction but as an event.
All three of these services collaborate implicitly by way of the xref:refguide:applib-cm:classes/mixins.adoc#HasUniqueId[`HasUniqueId`] interface.
