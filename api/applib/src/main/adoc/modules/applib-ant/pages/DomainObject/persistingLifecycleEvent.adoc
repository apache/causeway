Whenever a (just created, still transient) domain object is about to be saved (INSERTed in)to the database, a "persisting" lifecycle event is fired.

Subscribers subscribe through the xref:refguide:applib-svc:EventBusService.adoc[`EventBusService`] and can use the event to obtain a reference to the domain object.
The subscriber could then, for example, update the object, or it could use it maintain an external datastore.
One possible application is to maintain a full-text search database using link:https://lucene.apache.org/[Apache Lucene] or similar.

[NOTE]
====
Another use case is to maintain "last updated by"/"last updated at" properties.
While you can roll your own, note that the framework provides built-in support for this use case through the xref:applib-classes:roles-mixins-contributees/roles.adoc#Timestampable[`Timestampable`] role interface.
====

By default the event raised is `ObjectPersistingEvent.Default`.
For example:

[source,java]
----
@DomainObject
public class ToDoItemDto {
    ...
}
----

The purpose of the `persistingLifecycleEvent` attribute is to allows a custom subclass to be emitted instead.
A similar attribute is available for other lifecycle events.

For example:

[source,java]
----
@DomainObjectLayout(
    persistingLifecycleEvent=ToDoItem.PersistingEvent.class
)
public class ToDoItem {

    public static class PersistingEvent extends
        org.apache.isis.applib.events.lifecycle.ObjectPersistingEvent<ToDoItem> { }

    // ...
}
----

The benefit is that subscribers can be more targeted as to the events that they subscribe to.

== Subscribers

Subscribers (which must be domain services) subscribe to events posted through the xref:refguide:applib-svc:EventBusService.adoc[`EventBusService`].

Subscribers can be either coarse-grained (if they subscribe to the top-level event type):

[source,java]
----
import org.springframework.context.event.EventListener;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class SomeSubscriber {
    @EventListener(ObjectPersistingEvent.class)
    public void on(ObjectPersistingEvent ev) {
        if(ev.getSource() instanceof ToDoItem) {
            ...
        }
    }
}
----

or can be fine-grained (by subscribing to specific event subtypes):

[source,java]
----
import org.springframework.context.event.EventListener;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class SomeSubscriber {
    @EventListener(ToDoItem.ObjectPersistingEvent.class)
    public void on(ToDoItem.ObjectPersistingEvent ev) {
        // ...
    }
}
----

== Default, Doop and Noop events

If the `persistingLifecycleEvent` attribute is not explicitly specified (is left as its default value, `ObjectPersistingEvent.Default`), then the framework will, by default, post an event.

If this is not required, then the `isis.reflector.facet.domainObjectAnnotation.persistingLifecycleEvent.postForDefault` configuration property can be set to "false"; this will disable posting.

On the other hand, if the `persistingLifecycleEvent` has been explicitly specified to some subclass, then an event will be posted.
The framework provides `ObjectPersistingEvent.Doop` as such a subclass, so setting the `persistingLifecycleEvent` attribute to this class will ensure that the event to be posted, irrespective of the configuration property setting.

And, conversely, the framework also provides `ObjectPersistingEvent.Noop`; if `persistingLifecycleEvent` attribute is set to this class, then no event will be posted.
