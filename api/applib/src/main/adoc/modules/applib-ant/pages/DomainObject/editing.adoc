The `editing` attribute determines whether a domain object's properties and collections are not editable (are read-only).

The default is `AS_CONFIGURED`, meaning that the xref:refguide:config:sections/isis.applib.adoc#isis.applib.annotation.domain-object.editing[`isis.applib.annotation.domain-object.editing`]
configuration property is used to determine the whether the object is modifiable:

* `true` +
+ the object's properties and collections are modifiable.

* `false` +
+ the object's properties and collections are read-only, ie _not_ modifiable.

If there is no configuration property in `application.properties` then object are assumed to be modifiable.

[TIP]
====
In other words, editing can be disabled globally by setting the xref:refguide:config:sections/isis.applib.adoc#isis.applib.annotation.domain-object.editing[`isis.applib.adoc#isis.applib.annotation.domain-object.editing`] configuration property:

[source,ini]
----
isis.applib.annotation.domain-object.editing=false
----

We recommend this setting; it will help drive out the underlying business operations (processes and procedures) that require objects to change; these can then be captured as business actions.
====

This default can be overridden on an object-by-object basis; if `editing()` is set to `ENABLED` then the object's properties and collections are editable irrespective of the configured value; if set to `DISABLED` then the object's properties and collections are not editable irrespective of the configured value.

For example:

[source,java]
----
@DomainObject(
    editing=Editing.DISABLED,
    editingDisabledReason="Reference data, so cannot be modified"
)
public class Country {
    ...
}
----
