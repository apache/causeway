The `@HomePage` annotation allows a _single_ (no-arg, query-only) view model to be nominated 
as the default home page.
This is a view model that acts as some sort of dashboard, 
presenting key information and making the most commonly used actions easy to invoke.

For example, a todo app could use `@HomePage` on a dashboard of todo items to complete:

The corresponding code is:

[source,java]
----
@HomePage
@DomainObject(nature = Nature.VIEW_MODEL)
public class TodoAppDashboard {
    public String title() { return "Dashboard"; }

    public List<ToDoItem> getNotYetComplete() { /* ... */ }
    public List<ToDoItem> getComplete() { /* ... */ }

    public Blob exportToWordDoc() { /* ... */ }  // <.>
}
----
<.> associated using xref:userguide:fun:ui.adoc#object-layout[file-based layout] with the `notYetComplete` collection.

The other two actions shown in the above screenshot -- `exportAsXml` and `downloadLayout` -- are actually contributed to the `TodoAppDashboard` through various domain services, as is the `downloadLayout` action.
