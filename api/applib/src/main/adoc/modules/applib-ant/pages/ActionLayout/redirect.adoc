Often an action, when invoked, will return the target (in other words, will "return this").
The `redirect` attribute is used to control how the object is re-rendered.

There are three options:

* if set to `ONLY_IF_DIFFERS`, then the existing web page will not be re-rendered, rather it will be updated in-place (using Ajax).
+
This makes for a smoother UI.

[NOTE]
====
Any properties with xref:refguide:applib-ant:PropertyLayout.adoc#unchanging[`@PropertyLayout#unchanging`] are _not_ updated.
====

* if set to `EVEN_IF_SAME`, then a redirect occurs and a new web page is rendered.

* if set to `AS_CONFIGURED`, then the default behaviour is as specified by the `isis.viewer.wicket.redirectEvenIfSameObject` xref:vw:ROOT:configuration-properties.adoc[configuration property]).

One use case for choosing `EVEN_IF_SAME` is if the action "returning this" is intended in some way to require that the object use a different layout, as per multiple layout support, as specified using the xref:refguide:applib-cm:methods.adoc#layout[`layout()`] method.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {

    @Getter @Setter
    @PropertyLayout(hidden=ALWAYS)
    private String layout;

    public String layout() {                // <1>
        return layout;
    }

    @ActionLayout(
        redirect=EVEN_IF_SAME               // <2>
    )
    public Customer switchToEditMode() {
        setLayout("edit");
        return this;
    }
}
----
<1> specifies the alternate layout to use, eg `Customer-edit.layout.xml`.
<2> even though this action returns the same target object, still re-render the page.


If `switchToEditMode()` action is invoked, then the UI will attempt to render the customer using a `Customer.layout.edit.xml` layout file (instead of the default `Customer.layout.xml`).


== Alternatives

As an alternative to using the annotation, the dynamic xref:vw:ROOT:layout.adoc#file-based[file-based layout] can be used instead.
