|Annotation
|Purpose
|Layer
|Applies to


|xref:refguide:applib-ant:Column.adoc[`@javax.jdo.annotations.` +
`Column`]
|Used to determine whether a property is mandatory or optional.  For `String` and `BigDecimal` properties, used to determine length/precision/scale.

|Domain / persistence
|Property


|xref:refguide:applib-ant:Discriminator.adoc[`@javax.jdo.annotations.` +
`Discriminator`]
|Override for the object type, as used in `Bookmark`s, URLs for xref:vro:ROOT:about.adoc[RestfulObjects viewer] and elsewhere. +

Note that the discriminator overrides the object type that may otherwise be inferred from the xref:refguide:applib-ant:PersistenceCapable.adoc[`@PersistenceCapable`] annotation.

|Class


|xref:refguide:applib-ant:NotPersistent.adoc[`@javax.jdo.annotations.` +
`NotPersistent`]
|Used to determine whether to enforce or skip some xref:userguide:btb:about.adoc#custom-validator[metamodel validation] for `@Column` versus equivalent Isis annotations.

|Domain / persistence
|Property



|xref:refguide:applib-ant:PersistenceCapable.adoc[`@javax.jdo.annotations.` +
`PersistenceCapable`]
|Used to build Apache Isis' own internal identifier for objects. +

If the `schema` attribute is specified (and if xref:refguide:applib-ant:Discriminator.adoc[`@Discriminator`] __hasn't__ been specified), is also used to derive the object type, as used in `Bookmark`s, URLs for xref:vro:ROOT:about.adoc[RestfulObjects viewer] and elsewhere.

|Domain / persistence
|Class


|xref:refguide:applib-ant:PrimaryKey.adoc[`@javax.jdo.annotations.` +
`PrimaryKey`]
|Used to ensure Apache Isis does not overwrite application-defined primary keys, and to ensure is read-only in the UI.

|Domain / persistence
