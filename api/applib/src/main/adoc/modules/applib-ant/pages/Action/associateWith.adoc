The `associateWith` attribute allows an action to be associated with other properties or collections of the same domain object.
The optional `associateWithSequence` attribute specifies the order of the action in the UI.

For example, an `Order` could have a collection of ``OrderItem``s, and might provide actions to add and remove items:

[source,java]
----
public class Order {

    @Getter @Setter
    @Collection
    private final SortedSet<OrderItem> items = ...

    @Action(
        associateWith="items",                      // <.>
        associateWithSequence="1" )                 // <.>
    public Order addItem(Product p, int quantity) {
        // ...
    }

    @Action(
        associateWith="items",                      // <.>
        associateWithSequence="2" )                 // <.>
    public Order removeItem(OrderItem item) {
        // ...
    }

    // ...
}
----

<.> matches the name of the collection
<.> first action in the list of all associated actions
<.> matches the name of the collection
<.> second action in the list of all associated actions

These actions - `addItem()` and `removeItem()` can be thought of as associated with with the `items` collection because that is the state that they primarily affect.

In the user interface associated actions are rendered close to the member to which they relate.

[NOTE]
====
The same effect can be accomplished using `@MemberOrder` or with the `.layout.xml` file.

== Inferred Defaults and Choices

If an action is associated with a collection, then any scalar or collection parameter of the action that is the same type as that collection will automatically have a list of choices provided for it, being the items of the associated collection.

This is only done provided that there isn't already an explicit `choicesNXxx()` or `autoCompleteNXxx()` supporting method.
However, this list of choices _does_ take priority over any choices that are inferred from the parameter type itself (as per either an `@DomainObject(autoCompleteRepository=...)` or `@DomainObject(bounded=...)`).

In addition, if the action has a collection parameter of the same type as the associated collection, then the Wicket viewer will render the collection with checkboxes.
The user can use these checkboxes can be used to select the items of the action parameter.

For example, suppose we have a "removeItems(...)" action:

[source,java]
----
import lombok.Getter;
import lombok.Setter;

public class Order {

    @Getter @Setter
    @Collection
    private final SortedSet<OrderItem> items = ...

    @Action(
        associateWith="items",
        associateWithSequence="2" )
    public Order removeItems(SortedSet<OrderItem> items) {
        // ...
    }

    // ...
}
----

The Wicket viewer will then render the "items" collection with checkboxes, and any selected items will be used as the pre-selected set of items if the action is invoked.
