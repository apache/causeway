The JAXB `@XmlJavaTypeAdapter` annotation is used with the framework-provided
`PersistentEntityAdapter` to instruct JAXB to serialize references to persistent entities using the canonical
`OidDto` complex type: the object's type and its identifier.  This is the formal XML equivalent to the `Bookmark`
provided by the xref:refguide:applib-svc:BookmarkService.adoc[`BookmarkService`].

For example:

[source,java]
----
@XmlJavaTypeAdapter(PersistentEntityAdapter.class)
public class ToDoItem ...  {
    ...
}
----

This annotation therefore allows view models/DTOs to have references to persistent entities; a common idiom.

For a more complete discussion of writing JAXB view models/DTOs, see xref:userguide:fun:building-blocks.adoc#view-models[this topic]
in the user guide.
