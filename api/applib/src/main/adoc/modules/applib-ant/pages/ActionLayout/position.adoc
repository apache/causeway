The `position` attribute pertains only to actions that have been associated with properties using xref:refguide:applib-ant:MemberOrder.adoc[`@MemberOrder#named`].  For these actions, it specifies the positioning of the action's button with respect to the field representing the object property.

The attribute can take one of four values: `BELOW`, `RIGHT`, `PANEL` or `PANEL_DROPDOWN`.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {

    @Property(
        editing=Editing.DISABLED                 // <1>
    )
    public CustomerStatus getStatus() { /* ... */ }
    public void setStatus(CustomerStatus customerStatus) { /* ... */ }

    @MemberOrder(
        named="status",                          // <2>
        sequence="1"
    )
    @ActionLayout(
        named="Update",                          // <3>
        position=Position.BELOW
    )
    public CreditRating updateStatus(Customer ) { /* ... */ }
}
----
<1> indicate the property as read-only, such that it can only be updated using an action
<2> associate the "updateStatus" action with the "status" property
<3> give the action an abbreviated name, because the fact that the "status" property is to be updated is implied by its positioning


The default is `BELOW`, which is rendered (by the xref:vw:ROOT:about.adoc[Wicket viewer]) as shown below:

image::reference-annotations/ActionLayout/position-BELOW.png[width="720px",link="{imagesdir}/reference-annotations/ActionLayout/position-BELOW.png"]


If the action is positioned as `RIGHT`, then the action's button is rendered to the right of the property's field, in a compact drop-down.  This is ideal if there are many actions associated with a property:

image::reference-annotations/ActionLayout/position-RIGHT.png[width="720px",link="{imagesdir}/reference-annotations/ActionLayout/position-RIGHT.png"]



If the action is positioned as `PANEL`, then the action's button is rendered on the header of the panel that contains the property:

image::reference-annotations/ActionLayout/position-PANEL.png[width="720px",link="{imagesdir}/reference-annotations/ActionLayout/position-PANEL.png"]



And finally, if the action is positioned as `PANEL_DROPDOWN`, then the action's button is again rendered on the panel header, but as a drop-down:


image::reference-annotations/ActionLayout/position-PANEL_DROPDOWN.png[width="720px",link="{imagesdir}/reference-annotations/ActionLayout/position-PANEL_DROPDOWN.png"]



If there are multiple actions associated with a single property then the positioning can be mix'ed-and-match'ed as required.  If the `PANEL` or `PANEL_DROPDOWN` are used, then (as the screenshots above show) the actions from potentially multiple properties grouped by that panel will be shown together.


== Alternatives

As an alternative to using the annotation, the dynamic xref:vw:ROOT:layout.adoc#file-based[file-based layout] can be used instead.

The fact that the layout is dynamic (does not require a rebuild/restart) is particularly useful in that the look-n-feel can be easily experimented with and adjusted.
