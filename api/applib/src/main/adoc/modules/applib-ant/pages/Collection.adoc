// TODO - v2 to reconcile with .java (or maybe just delete)

//<.> xref:refguide:applib-ant:Collection.adoc#domainEvent[`domainEvent()`]
//+
//The event type to be posted to the xref:refguide:applib-svc:EventBusService.adoc[`EventBusService`] to broadcast the collection's business rule checking (hide, disable, validate) and its modification (before and after).
//
//<.> xref:refguide:applib-ant:Collection.adoc#hidden[`hidden()`]
//+
//Indicates where (in the UI) the collection should be hidden from the user.
//
//<.> xref:refguide:applib-ant:Collection.adoc#typeOf[`typeOf()`]
//+
//Hints as to the run-time type of the objects within that collection (as a fallback)


For example:

[source,java]
----
public class ToDoItem {
    public static class DependenciesChangedEvent
            extends CollectionDomainEvent<ToDoItem, ToDoItem> { } // <1>
    @Collection(
        domainEvent=DependenciesChangedEvent.class,
        editing = Editing.ENABLED,
        hidden = Where.NOWHERE,                                   // <2>
        notPersisted = false,                                     // <3>
        typeOf = ToDoItem.class                                   // <4>
    )
    public SortedSet<ToDoItem> getDependencies() { /* ... */ }
    ...
}
----
<1> can use no-arg constructor.
<2> default value, so could be omitted
<3> default value, so could be omitted
<4> default value, so could be omitted




[TIP]
====
The annotation is one of a handful (others including xref:refguide:applib-ant:CollectionLayout.adoc[`@CollectionLayout`], xref:refguide:applib-ant:Property.adoc[`@Property`] and xref:refguide:applib-ant:PropertyLayout.adoc[`@PropertyLayout`]) that can also be applied to the field, rather than the getter method.
This is so that boilerplate-busting tools such as link:https://projectlombok.org/[Project Lombok] can be used.
