The `hidden()` attribute indicates where (in the UI) the collection should be hidden from the user.



[TIP]
====
It is also possible to use xref:refguide:applib-ant:Collection.adoc#hidden[`@Collection#hidden`] to hide an action at the domain layer.
Both options are provided with a view that in the future the view-layer semantics may be under the control of (expert) users, whereas domain-layer semantics should never be overridden or modified by the user.
====

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class ToDoItem {
    @CollectionLayout(
        hidden=Where.EVERYWHERE
    public SortedSet<ToDoItem> getDependencies() { /* ... */ }
    ...
}
----


The acceptable values for the `where` parameter are:

* `Where.EVERYWHERE` or `Where.ANYWHERE`
+
The collection should be hidden everywhere.

* `Where.ANYWHERE`
+
Synonym for everywhere.

* `Where.OBJECT_FORMS`
+
The collection should be hidden when displayed within an object form.

* `Where.NOWHERE`
+
The collection should not be hidden.

The other values of the `Where` enum have no meaning for a collection.


== Alternatives


As an alternative to using the annotation, the dynamic xref:vw:ROOT:layout.adoc#file-based[file-based layout] can be used instead.

This attribute can also be applied to:

* xref:refguide:applib-ant:ActionLayout.adoc#hidden[actions]
