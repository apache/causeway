The `labelPosition` attribute determines the positioning of labels for parameters.

The positioning of labels is typically `LEFT`, but can be positioned to the `TOP`.  The one exception is xref:refguide:applib-ant:ParameterLayout.adoc#multiLine[`multiLine()`] string parameters, where the label defaults to `TOP` automatically (to provide as much real-estate for the multiline text field as possible).

For boolean parameters a positioning of `RIGHT` is also allowed; this is ignored for all other types.

It is also possible to suppress the label altogether, using `NONE`.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Order {
    public Order changeStatus(
            OrderStatus newStatus
            @Parameter(
                optionality=Optionality.OPTIONAL
            )
            @ParameterLayout(
                named="Reason",
                labelPosition=LabelPosition.TOP
            )
            String reason) {
        ...
    }
    ...
}
