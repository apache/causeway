The `menuBar` attribute is a hint to specify where on the application menu a domain service's actions should be rendered.

For example:

[source,java]
----
@DomainService
@DomainServiceLayout(menuBar=MenuBar.PRIMARY)
public class ToDoItems {
    ...
}
----

In the xref:vw:ROOT:about.adoc[Wicket viewer], domain services placed on the `PRIMARY` menu bar appears to the left:

image::reference-annotations/DomainServiceLayout/menuBar-primary.png[width="720px",link="{imagesdir}/reference-annotations/DomainServiceLayout/menuBar-primary.png"]

Domain services placed on the `SECONDARY` menu bar appear to the right:

image::reference-annotations/DomainServiceLayout/menuBar-secondary.png[width="720px",link="{imagesdir}/reference-annotations/DomainServiceLayout/menuBar-secondary.png"]


Domain services placed on the `TERTIARY` appear in the menu bar associated with the user's name (far top-right)

image::reference-annotations/DomainServiceLayout/menuBar-tertiary.png[width="720px",link="{imagesdir}/reference-annotations/DomainServiceLayout/menuBar-tertiary.png"]


The grouping of multiple domain services actions within a single drop-down is managed by the link:https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/annotation/Order.html[`@Order`] annotation.
Alternatively, use `menubars.layout.xml` layout file to organize menu action items arbitrarily.

[NOTE]
====
The xref:vro:ROOT:about.adoc[RestfulObjects viewer] does not support this attribute.
