By default actions are available irrespective of the xref:refguide:config:about.adoc#deployment-types[deployment mode].
The `restrictTo` attribute specifies whether the action should instead be restricted to only available in prototyping mode.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {

    @Action
    public Order placeNewOrder() {
        // ...
    }
    @Action(semantics=SemanticsOf.SAFE)
    public List<Order> listRecentOrders() {
        // ...
    }

    @Action(restrictTo=RestrictTo.PROTOTYPING)      // <.>
    public List<Order> listAllOrders() {
        // ...
    }
    ...
}
----

<.> Only visible in prototype mode.

In this case the listing of all orders (in the `listAllOrders()` action) probably doesn't make sense for production; there could be thousands or millions.
However, it would be useful to disaply how for a test or demo system where there are only a handful of orders.
