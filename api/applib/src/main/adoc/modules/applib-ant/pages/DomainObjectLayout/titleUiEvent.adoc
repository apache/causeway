Whenever a domain object is to be rendered, the framework fires off a title UI event to obtain a title for the object.
This is as an alternative to implementing xref:refguide:applib-cm:methods.adoc#title[`title()`] reserved method, or using the xref:refguide:applib-ant:Title.adoc[`@Title`] annotation, within the class itself.
(If either `title()` or `@Title` are present, then they will take precedence).

Subscribers subscribe through the xref:refguide:applib-svc:core-domain-api/EventBusService.adoc[`EventBusService`] and can
use obtain a reference to the domain object from the event.
From this they can, if they wish, specify a title for the domain object using the event's API.

[NOTE]
====
The feature was originally introduced so that xref:refguide:applib-ant:XmlRootElement.adoc[`@XmlRootElement`]-annotated xref:userguide:fun:building-blocks.adoc#view-models[view model]s could be kept as minimal as possible, just defining the data.
UI events allow subscribers to provide UI hints, while xref:userguide:fun:building-blocks.adoc#mixins[mixin]s can be used to provide the behaviour.
====

By default the event raised is `TitleUiEvent.Default`.
For example:

[source,java]
----
@DomainObjectLayout
public class ToDoItemDto {
    ...
}
----

The purpose of the `titleUiEvent` attribute is to allows a custom subclass to be emitted instead.
A similar attribute is available for icon names and CSS classes.

For example:

[source,java]
----
@DomainObjectLayout(
    titleUiEvent=ToDoItemDto.TitleUiEvent.class
)
public class ToDoItemDto {
    public static class TitleUiEvent
        extends org.apache.isis.applib.events.ui.TitleUiEvent<ToDoItemDto> { }
    ...
}
----

The benefit is that subscribers can be more targeted as to the events that they subscribe to.




== Subscribers

Subscribers (which must be domain services) subscribe using either the link:https://github.com/google/guava[Guava] API or (if the xref:refguide:applib-svc:core-domain-api/EventBusService.adoc[`EventBusService`] has been appropriately configured) using the link:http://www.axonframework.org/[Axon Framework] API.
The examples below are compatible with both.

Subscribers can be either coarse-grained (if they subscribe to the top-level event type):

[source,java]
----
import org.springframework.context.event.EventListener;

@DomainService(nature=NatureOfService.DOMAIN)
public class SomeSubscriber extends AbstractSubscriber {
    @EventListener(TitleUiEvent.class)
    public void on(TitleUiEvent ev) {
        if(ev.getSource() instanceof ToDoItemDto) {
            ...
        }
    }
}
----

or can be fine-grained (by subscribing to specific event subtypes):

[source,java]
----
import org.springframework.context.event.EventListener;

@DomainService(nature=NatureOfService.DOMAIN)
public class SomeSubscriber extends AbstractSubscriber {
    @EventListener(ToDoItemDto.TitleUiEvent.class)
    public void on(ToDoItemDto.TitleUiEvent ev) {
        ...
    }
}
----

The subscriber should then use either `TitleUiEvent#setTranslatableTitle(...)` or `TitleUiEvent#setTitle(...)` to actually specify the title to be used.




== Default, Doop and Noop events

If the `titleUiEvent` attribute is not explicitly specified (is left as its default value, `TitleUiEvent.Default`), then the framework will, by default, post an event.

If this is not required, then the `isis.reflector.facet.domainObjectLayoutAnnotation.titleUiEvent.postForDefault` configuration property can be set to "false"; this will disable posting.

On the other hand, if the `titleUiEvent` has been explicitly specified to some subclass, then an event will be posted.
The framework provides `TitleUiEvent.Doop` as such a subclass, so setting the `titleUiEvent` attribute to this class will ensure that the event to be posted, irrespective of the configuration property setting.

And, conversely, the framework also provides `TitleUiEvent.Noop`; if `titleUiEvent` attribute is set to this class, thn no event will be posted.


== Raising events programmatically

Normally events are only raised for interactions through the UI.
However, events can be raised programmatically either by calling the xref:refguide:applib-svc:core-domain-api/EventBusService.adoc[`EventBusService`] API directly, or as a result of calling the xref:refguide:applib-svc:application-layer-api/TitleService.adoc[`TitleService`]'s `titleOf(...)` method.

This attribute can also be applied to xref:refguide:applib-ant:ViewModelLayout.adoc#titleUiEvent[view models].
