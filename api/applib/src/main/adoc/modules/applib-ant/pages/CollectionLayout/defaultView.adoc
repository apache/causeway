The xref:vw:ROOT:about.adoc[Wicket viewer] allows additional views to be configured to render collections of objects; at the time of writing thesee include the excel, fullcalendar2 and gmap3 provided by the (non-ASF) link:https://platform.incode.org[Incode Platform^].
If the objects to be rendered have the correct "shape", then the appropriate view will be made available.  For example, objects with a date can be rendered using `calendar`; objects with locations can be rendered using `map`.

The `defaultView` attribute is used to select which of these views should be used by default for a given collection.


For example:

[source,java]
----
public class BusRoute {
    @CollectionLayout(
        defaultView="map"
    )
    public SortedSet<BusStop> getStops() { /* ... */ }
    ...
}
----


[NOTE]
====
This attribute takes precedence over any value for the xref:refguide:applib-ant:CollectionLayout.adoc#render[`@CollectionLayout#render`] attribute.  For example, if the
`defaultView` attribute is defined to "table", then the table will be show even if `render` is set to `LAZILY`.
====


== Alternatives


As an alternative to using the annotation, the dynamic xref:vw:ROOT:layout.adoc#file-based[file-based layout] can be used instead.
