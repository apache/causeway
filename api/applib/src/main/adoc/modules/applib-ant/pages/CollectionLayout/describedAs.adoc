The `describedAs()` attribute is used to provide a short description of the collection to the user.  In the xref:vw:ROOT:about.adoc[Wicket viewer] it is displayed as a 'tool tip'.

The `describedAs()` attribute can also be specified for xref:refguide:applib-ant:PropertyLayout.adoc#describedAs[properties], xref:refguide:applib-ant:ActionLayout.adoc#describedAs[actions], xref:refguide:applib-ant:ParameterLayout.adoc#describedAs[parameters], xref:refguide:applib-ant:DomainObjectLayout.adoc#describedAs[domain objects] and xref:refguide:applib-ant:ViewModelLayout.adoc#describedAs[view models].


For example:

[source,java]
----
public class ToDoItem {
    @CollectionLayout(
        describedAs="Other todo items that must be completed before this one"
    )
    public SortedSet<ToDoItem> getDependencies() { /* ... */ }
    ...
}
----


== Alternatives


As an alternative to using the annotation, the dynamic xref:vw:ROOT:layout.adoc#file-based[file-based layout] can be used instead.
