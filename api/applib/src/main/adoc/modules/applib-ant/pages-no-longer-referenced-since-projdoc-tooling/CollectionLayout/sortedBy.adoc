The `sortedBy` attribute specifies that the collection be ordered using the specified comparator, rather than the natural ordering of the entity (as would usually be the case).

For example:

[source,java]
----
import lombok.Getter;
import lombok.Setter;

public class ToDoItem implements Comparable<ToDoItem> {         // <.>

    public static class DescriptionComparator                   // <.>
                            implements Comparator<ToDoItem> {
        @Override
        public int compare(ToDoItem o1, ToDoItem o2) {
            return Comparator.comparing(ToDoItem::getDescription)
                             .compare(o1, o2);
        }
    }

    @CollectionLayout(sortedBy=DependenciesComparator.class)    // <.>
    @Getter @Setter
    private SortedSet<ToDoItem> dependencies = ...

}
----
<.> the class has a natural ordering (implementation not shown)
<.> declaration of an alternative comparator class, using the object's `description` property
<.> ordering of the collection defined as being by this comparator

When the `dependencies` collection is rendered, the elements are sorted by the `description` property first:

== Alternatives

As an alternative to using the annotation, the dynamic xref:userguide:fun:ui.adoc#object-layout[file-based layout] can be used instead.
