The `cssClass` attribute can be used to render additional CSS classes in the HTML (a wrapping `<div>`) that represents the collection.   xref:refguide:config:application-specific/application-css.adoc[Application-specific CSS] can then be used to target and adjust the UI representation of that particular element.

For example:

[source,java]
----
import lombok.Getter;
import lombok.Setter;

public class ToDoItem {

    @CollectionLayout(
        cssClass="x-important"
    )
    @Getter @Setter
    private SortedSet<ToDoItem> dependencies = ...;

}
----

== Alternatives

As an alternative to using the annotation, the dynamic xref:userguide:fun:ui.adoc#object-layout[file-based layout] can be used instead.
