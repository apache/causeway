The `hidden` attribute indicates where (in the UI) the property should be hidden from the user.

[TIP]
====
It is also possible to use xref:system:generated:index/applib/annotation/PropertyLayout.adoc#hidden[`@PropertyLayout#hidden`] or a xref:userguide:fun:ui.adoc#object-layout[file-based layout] such that the property can be hidden at the view layer.
Both options are provided with a view that in the future the view-layer semantics may be under the control of (expert) users, whereas domain-layer semantics should never be overridden or modified by the user.
====

For example:

[source,java]
----
import lombok.Getter;
import lombok.Setter;

public class Customer {

    @PropertyLayout(
        hidden=Where.ALL_TABLES
    )
    @Getter @Setter
    private int internalId;

    // ...
}
----

The acceptable values for the `where` parameter are:

* `Where.EVERYWHERE` or `Where.ANYWHERE`
+
The property should be hidden everywhere.

* `Where.ANYWHERE`
+
Synonym for everywhere.

* `Where.OBJECT_FORMS`
+
The property should be hidden when displayed within an object form.

* `Where.PARENTED_TABLES`
+
The property should be hidden when displayed as a column of a table within a parent object's collection.

* `Where.STANDALONE_TABLES`
+
The property should be hidden when displayed as a column of a table showing a standalone list of objects, for example as returned by a repository query.

* `Where.ALL_TABLES`
+
The property should be hidden when displayed as a column of a table, either an object's * collection or a standalone list.
This combines `PARENTED_TABLES` and `STANDALONE_TABLES`.

* `Where.NOWHERE`
+
The property should not be hidden, overriding any other metadata/conventions that would normally cause the property to be hidden.

For example, if a property is annotated with xref:system:generated:index/applib/annotation/Title.adoc[`@Title`], then normally this should be hidden from all tables.
Annotating with `@Property(where=Where.NOWHERE)` overrides this.

[NOTE]
====
The xref:vro:ROOT:about.adoc[RestfulObjects viewer] has only partial support for these `Where` enums.
====

== Alternatives

As an alternative to using the annotation, the dynamic xref:userguide:fun:ui.adoc#object-layout[file-based layout] can be used instead.

== See also

This attribute can also be applied to:

* xref:system:generated:index/applib/annotation/Action.adoc#hidden[actions]
* xref:system:generated:index/applib/annotation/Collection.adoc#hidden[collections].
