Collections can be hidden at the domain-level, indicating that they are not visible to the end-user.


[TIP]
====
It is also possible to use xref:system:generated:index/applib/annotation/CollectionLayout.adoc#hidden[`@CollectionLayout#hidden`] or using xref:userguide:fun:ui.adoc#object-layout[file-based layout] such that the collection can be hidden at the view layer.
====

For example:

[source,java]
----
import lombok.Getter;
import lombok.Setter;

public class Customer {

    @Collection(where=Where.EVERYWHERE)
    @Getter @Setter
    private SortedSet<Address> addresses = ...

}
----


The acceptable values for the `where` parameter are:

* `Where.EVERYWHERE` or `Where.ANYWHERE` +
+
The collection should be hidden everywhere.

* `Where.ANYWHERE` +
+
Synonym for everywhere.

* `Where.OBJECT_FORMS` +
+
The collection should be hidden when displayed within an object form.

* `Where.NOWHERE` +
+
The collection should not be hidden.

The other values of the `Where` enum have no meaning for a collection.
