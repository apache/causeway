The `cssClass` attribute can be used to render additional CSS classes in the HTML (a wrapping `<div>`) that represents the action.
xref:refguide:config:application-specific/application-css.adoc[Application-specific CSS] can then be used to target and adjust the UI representation of that particular element.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class ToDoItem {
    @ActionLayout(cssClass="x-key")
    public ToDoItem postpone(LocalDate until) { /* ... */ }
    ...
}
----

[NOTE]
====
The similar xref:refguide:applib-ant:ActionLayout.adoc#cssClassFa[`@ActionLayout#cssClassFa`] annotation attribute is also used as a hint to apply CSS, specifically to add http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/[Font Awesome icons] on action menu items or buttons.
====

== Alternatives

As an alternative to using the annotation, the dynamic xref:userguide:fun:ui.adoc#object-layout[file-based layout] can be used instead.
