Apache Isis can render and persist all of the JDK primitives and wrapper classes, and a number of other JDK (7.x) classes that represent value types.

It also supports some of the link:http://www.joda.org/joda-time/[Joda-Time] datatypes, and a number of value types that are shipped by the framework itself.

In addition to primitives, the JDK Classes supported are:

* the wrapper classes:

** `java.lang.Boolean`, `java.lang.Character`, `java.lang.Double`, `java.lang.Float`, `java.lang.Long`, `java.lang.Integer`, `java.lang.Short`, `java.lang.Byte`

* `java.lang.String`

* numeric data types:

** `java.math.BigDecimal`
** `java.math.BigInteger`

* date types:

** `java.sql.Date`
** `java.sql.Time`
** `java.sql.Timestamp`
** `java.util.Date`

It supports these Joda-Time classes:

* `org.joda.time.DateTime`
* `org.joda.time.LocalDateTime`
* `org.joda.time.LocalDate`


The value types defined by the framework itself (in the applib) are:

* `o.a.i.applib.value.Blob`
+
binary large object, eg PDFs or images

* `o.a.i.applib.value.Markup`

+
Intended for use as a read-only property to display arbitrary HTML.

* `o.a.i.applib.value.Clob`

+
character large objects, eg XML

* `o.a.i.applib.value.Money`

+
A currency and amount

* `o.a.i.applib.value.Password`

+
A simple wrapper around a string, but never shown in plain-text.
