The `persisted()` lifecycle callback method is called when object has just been persisted from the object store.

An alternative means to interact with the lifecycle is by setting up a subscriber on the xref:applib-ant:DomainObject.adoc#persistedLifecycleEvent[`@DomainObject#persistedLifecycleEvent()`] event.

See also the xref:refguide:applib-methods:lifecycle.adoc#persisting[`persisting()`] callback.
