/**
 * Domain service to (attempt) to recognize certain
 * exceptions, and return user-friendly messages instead.
 *
 * <p>
 * Rather than redirecting to a general-purpose error page,
 * the message (corresponding to the recognized exception) is rendered
 * as a regular validation message.
 *
 * <p>
 * For example, a set of recognizers are provided for the JPA
 * object store in order to recognize and handle SQL constraint
 * exceptions such as uniqueness violations. These can then be rendered back to
 * the user as expected errors, rather than fatal stacktraces.
 *
 * <p>
 * More than one implementation of {@link ExceptionRecognizer} can
 * be registered; they will all be consulted (in the order as specified by
 * Spring's {@link org.springframework.core.annotation.Order} annotation)
 * to determine if they recognize the exception.
 * The message returned by the first service recognizing the exception is
 * used.
 *
 * <p>
 * The framework also provides a default implementation of this
 * service that recognizes any {@link org.apache.causeway.applib.exceptions.RecoverableException}, simply returning
 * the exception's {@link org.apache.causeway.applib.exceptions.RecoverableException#getMessage() message}.  This
 * allows any component or domain object to throw this exception with
 * the knowledge that it will be handled appropriately.
 *
 * <p>
 * Initially introduced for the Wicket viewer; check the documentation
 * of other viewers to determine whether they also support this service.
