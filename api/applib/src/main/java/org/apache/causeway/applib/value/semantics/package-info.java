/**
 * The classes in this package are used for implementing custom value types.
 *
 * <p>
 *     <b>NOTE THAT</b> in addition to implementing the interfaces here, it is also necessary to provide appropriate
 *   components for Wicket viewer to edit the values and to implement the appropriate SPI/extension points so that
 *   DataNucleus can persist the objects to the database.
 * </p>
 *
 *
 * <p>
 * The {@link org.apache.causeway.applib.value.semantics.ValueSemanticsProvider} interface
 * allows the framework to recognize its corresponding type as being a value
 * type (that is, having value semantics).  The {@link org.apache.causeway.applib.value.semantics.ValueSemanticsAbstract}
 * class is an base adapter for this interface.
 *
 * <p>
 * The association between {@link org.apache.causeway.applib.value.semantics.ValueSemanticsProvider}
 * and its corresponding type can be done in several ways.  Most straightforward
 * is to annotate the class with the {@link org.apache.causeway.applib.annotation.Value}
 * annotation.  However, if the value type source code cannot be modified, then the association
 * can be made using configuration properties.
 *
 * @deprecated
