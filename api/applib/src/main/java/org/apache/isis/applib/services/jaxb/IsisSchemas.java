 * <p>
 * The practical benefit of this is that for many DTOs there will only be one other
 * schema, that of the DTO itself.  The {@link Dto_downloadXsd} mixin uses this to return that single XSD,
 * rather than generating a ZIP of two schemas (the Isis schema and the one for the DTO), as it would otherwise;
 * far more convenient when debugging and so on.  The Isis schemas can always be
 * <a href="http://isis.apache.org/schema">downloaded</a> from the Isis website.
