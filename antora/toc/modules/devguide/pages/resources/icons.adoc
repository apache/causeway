Most Apache Isis viewers use icons to help identify domain objects in the user interface.
It's a good idea to ensure that these are styled consistently.
Here are some open source icon sets for both personal and commercial use (though some require a link back to the authors website):

* http://icons8.com/[icons8] (both free and commercial)
* http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Icon_Library[tango desktop] icon set - as used in Linux GNOME and KDE desktops (free)
* http://thenounproject.com/[the noun project] community of icon providers (both free and commercial)
* http://www.flaticon.com/[flaticon] - free vector icons
* http://google.github.io/material-design-icons/[Google material design] and http://www.google.com/design/spec/resources/sticker-sheets.html#[zip here]
