The release process consists of:

* the release manager xref:toc:comguide:about.adoc#cutting-a-release[cutting the release]
* members of the Apache Isis PMC xref:toc:comguide:about.adoc#verifying-releases[verifying] and voting on the release
* the release manager performing post-release tasks, for either a xref:toc:comguide:about.adoc#post-release-successful[successful] or an unsuccessful vote (latter documented below).

If the vote did not succeed (did not achieve +3 votes after 72 hours and/or is unlikely to do so), then the vote should be closed and the following steps performed.

Note that a release manager may also decide to cancel a vote before 72 hours has elapsed (for example if an error is quickly discovered).


== Inform dev ML

Post the results to the `dev@isis.a.o` mailing list.

For example, use the following subject for a vote on Apache Isis Core:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
[RESULT] [VOTE] Apache Isis Core release {isisnext}
----

using the body (alter last line as appropriate):

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
The vote has completed with the following result :

  +1 (binding): _list of names_
  +1 (non binding): _list of names_

  -1 (binding): _list of names_
  -1 (non binding): _list of names_

The vote is UNSUCCESSFUL.
----


== Tidy up branches

Tidy up remote branches in the git repo:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
git push --delete origin release-{isisnext}-RC1
git push --delete origin isis-{isisnext}-RC1
git tag -d isis-{isisnext}
----

These steps:

* delete the remote branch
* delete the remote origin server's tags
* delete the tags that were created locally


== Tidy up the Nexus repo

Drop staging repositories:

* drop the staging repository in http://repository.apache.org[Nexus]




== Reset

Finally, rewind the release branch to prior to the previous release candidate, and continue from there.
