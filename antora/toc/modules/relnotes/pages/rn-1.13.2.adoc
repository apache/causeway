This is a maintenance release with a number of minor improvements and bug fixes.
If these the main improvement is that the simpleapp archetype has been substantially reworked to be more modular.

This release also closes the ticket to provide a better DB migration story; this has been implemented by way of the (non-ASF) link:https://platform.incode.org[Incode Platform^]'s flywaydb module.
