https://algolia.com[Algolia] is a commercial index-as-a-service offering, with a free plan for open source projects.
It is used by many websites built with link:https://antora.org[Antora], including Antora's own https://docs.antora.org[website].

This page describes how we have incorporated Algolia to provide a searchable index for link:https://isis.apache.org[isis.apache.org] website.
They are based on/adapt Dan Allen's link:https://gitlab.com/antora/antora-ui-default/issues/44#note_68053321[notes] for setting up search on the Antora website.

[NOTE]
====
An alternative and perhaps slightly simpler approach would be to use link:https://docsearch.algolia.com[Algolia's DocSearch], which performs the scanning automatically.

The benefit of the approach described here is that it could be scripted easily into CI.
====


== Clone the isis-site

If necessary, clone out the current version of the isis website:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/apache/isis-site .
git checkout asf-site
----

The "asf-site" branch is what is published, and the content of the site resides in `content` directory.


== Create Algolia Application and Empty Index

* Registered on https://algolia.com[]

* Applied for open source license

* On website:
** Created app: "5ISP5TFAEN"
** Created empty index "isis-apache-org"
** Made note of the search API key: "0fc51c28b4ad46e7318e96d4e97fab7c"
** Made note of the Admin API key: "xxx"
+
CAUTION: the "admin API" should not be made public, as it allows the index to be modified or deleted.

== Create the Crawler config

We use Algolia's link:https://docsearch.algolia.com/docs/scraper/[DocSearch crawler] tool (also called the scraper) to index over the static html files to populate the index records.
A config file describes how to process the files

[source,json]
.algolia-config.json
----
include::attachment$algolia-search/config.json[]
----

The config file reference can be found link:https://docsearch.algolia.com/docs/config-file[here].

This has been checked into isis-site as `./algolia-config.json`.


== Update the Antora UI bundle

The link:https://github.com/apache/isis-antora[Antora UI bundle] (which defines the skin of the website) was updated.
There are four steps:

* reference the CSS
* reference the JavaScript
* set up an input field for the `docsearch` JavaScript function to hook into
* run the `docsearch` JavaScript function on page load

These are fully described in the link:https://docsearch.algolia.com/docs/dropdown[Algolia docs].
There are other options for styling, see link:https://docsearch.algolia.com/docs/styling/[here].



== Generate and Publish the site

The remaining steps are routine and performed each time there is a change to the site:

* xref:post-release-successful.adoc#generate-website[Generate website] and then
* xref:post-release-successful.adoc#index-the-site[Index the site], and then
* xref:post-release-successful.adoc#publish-website[Publish website].

And you're done.
