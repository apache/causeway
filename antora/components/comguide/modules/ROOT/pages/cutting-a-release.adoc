The release process consists of:

* the release manager cutting the release (documented below)
* Members of the Apache Isis PMC xref:comguide:ROOT:verifying-releases.adoc[verifying] and voting on the release
* the release manager performing post-release tasks, for either a xref:comguide:ROOT:post-release-successful.adoc[successful] or an xref:comguide:ROOT:post-release-unsuccessful.adoc[unsuccessful] vote.

Apache Isis itself is released in one go, everything is ultimately a child of `isis-parent/pom.xml` (relative to the link:https://github.com/apache/isis[source code root]).
This section details the process for formally releasing this module.

The subsequent sections describe how other committers can xref:comguide:ROOT:verifying-releases.adoc[verify a release] and how the release manager can then perform xref:comguide:ROOT:post-release-successful.adoc[post-release] activities and set up for the next development iteration.

If you've not performed a release before, then note that there are some configuration xref:comguide:ROOT:release-process-prereqs.adoc[prerequisites] that must be configured first.
In particular, you'll need signed public/private keys, and the ASF Nexus staging repo inlocal `~/.m2/settings.xml` file.

These release notes using bash command line tools.
They should work on Linux and MacOS; for Windows, use mSysGit.


== Preparation

[WARNING]
====
The release process should be performed on Java 11.

This updated dependency changed as of 2.0.0-M6.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
The deploy process requires `gpg` v2.1 or later.
====

=== Obtain Consensus

Before releasing the framework, ensure there is consensus on the xref:docs:support:mailing-list.adoc[dev mailing list] that this is the right time for a release.
The discussion should include confirming the version number to be used, and to confirm content.

These discussions should also confirm the version number of the module being released.
This should be in line with our xref:comguide:ROOT:policies/versioning-policy.adoc#semantic-versioning[semantic versioning policy].

Make sure you have a JIRA ticket open against which to perform all commits.
In most cases a JIRA ticket will have been created at the beginning of the previous release cycle.


=== Pull down code to release

Set the HEAD of your local git repo to the commit to be released.
This will usually be the tip of the origin's `master` branch:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
git checkout master
git pull --ff-only
----


=== License headers

The Apache Release Audit Tool `RAT` (from the http://creadur.apache.org[Apache Creadur] project) checks for missing license header files.
The parent `pom.xml` of each releasable module specifies the RAT Maven plugin, with a number of custom exclusions.

To run the RAT tool, use:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
.find unapproved/missing licenses
----
mvn clean

pushd isis-parent
mvn org.apache.rat:apache-rat-plugin:check -D rat.numUnapprovedLicenses=1000 -Dreleased
popd

for a in `/bin/find . -name rat.txt -print`; do grep '!???' $a; done > /tmp/rat-qn.txt
for a in `/bin/find . -name rat.txt -print`; do grep '!AL' $a; done > /tmp/rat-al.txt
----

NOTE: the parent `pom.xml` in each of these locations has the `apache-rat-plugin` appropriately configured.

This script runs over all submodules, including non-released modules.

The command writes out a `target\rat.txt` for each submodule. missing license notes are indicated using the key `!???`.
The `for` command collates all the errors.

Investigate and fix any reported violations, typically by either:

* adding genuinely missing license headers from Java (or other) source files, or
* updating the `<excludes>` element for the `apache-rat-plugin` plugin to ignore test files, log files and any other non-source code files
* also look to remove any stale `<exclude>` entries

Once you've fixed all issues, run the script again to confirm that all license violations have been fixed.

=== Missing License Check

Although Apache Isis has no dependencies on artifacts with incompatible licenses, the POMs for some of these dependencies (in the Maven central repo) do not necessarily contain the required license information.
Without appropriate additional configuration, this would result in the generated `DEPENDENCIES` file and generated Maven site indicating dependencies as having "unknown" licenses.

Fortunately, Maven allows the missing information to be provided by configuring the `maven-remote-resources-plugin`.
This is stored in the `src/main/appended-resources/supplemental-models.xml` file, relative to the root of each releasable module.

It's first necessary to have built the framework locally at least once.

In the root directory:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
mvn clean install -o -DskipTests
----

Once this is done, capture the missing license information using:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
mvn license:download-licenses
groovy scripts/checkmissinglicenses.groovy
----


The Maven plugin creates a `license.xml` file in the `target/generated-resources` directory of each module.
The script then searches for these `licenses.xml` files, and compares them against the contents of the `supplemental-models.xml` file.

For example, the output could be something like:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
licenses to add to supplemental-models.xml:

[org.slf4j, slf4j-api, 1.5.7]
[org.codehaus.groovy, groovy-all, 1.7.2]

licenses to remove from supplemental-models.xml (are spurious):

[org.slf4j, slf4j-api, 1.5.2]
----

If any missing entries are listed or are spurious, then update `supplemental-models.xml` and try again.


=== Reconcile isis-parent pom

The `isis-parent/pom.xml` is a customisation of the `org.apache:apache` pom, with each section of customisation clearly identified.

Check to see if there has been a new version of `org.apache:apache`; if so, merge in the changes.

=== Update the project build timestamp

For link:https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-reproducible-builds.html[reproducibility], the `project.build.outputTimestamp` property must be updated to a hard-coded value.

Locate this property in `isis-parent/pom.xml` and update to the current date/time.

=== Update and preview website

The next step is to generate the website, ensuring that the config, examples, projdoc (system overview and global index) are all updated.

Be careful that sometimes the configuration property pages (that are generated from the `core/config/target/classes/META-INF/spring-configuration-metadata.json` file) may be malformed; in particular for default values going missing.

This seems to occur if the IDE (IntelliJ) has compiled the codebase.

The workaround is to rebuild the `core/config` Maven module using `mvn` command line first.

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
mvn clean install -pl core/config
----

Then, generate the website:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
sh preview.sh
----

Check for any Asciidoc errors, and fix.
Also double-check that the config property files are correctly formatted.


=== Commit changes

Commit any changes from the preceding steps:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
git add ..
git commit -m "$ISISJIRA: updates to pom.xml etc for release"
----


== Releasing the Framework

=== Set environment variables

We use environment variables to parameterize as many of the steps as possible.
For example:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
export ISISJIRA=ISIS-9999                           # <.>
export ISISTMP=/c/tmp                               # <.>
export ISISREL={page-isisrel}                             # <.>
export ISISRC=RC1                                   # <.>
export ISISBRANCH=release-$ISISREL-$ISISRC
export ISISART=isis
env | grep ISIS | sort
----
<.> set to an "umbrella" ticket for all release activities.
(One should exist already, xref:comguide:ROOT:post-release-successful.adoc#create-new-jira[created at] the beginning of the development cycle now completing).
<.> adjust by platform
<.> adjust as required
<.> adjust as necessary if this is not the first attempt to release


[IMPORTANT]
====
The branch name is intentionally *not* the same as the eventual tag names (eg `isis-{page-isisrel}`).
====


=== Create a release branch and worktree

The release is performed on a branch; if we are successful, this branch will be merged back into master.

We also recommend performing this work in a separate git worktree.
The original worktree can stay with the `master` branch and be used for documentation fixes, etc.

* create (but don't checkout) a release branch for the version number being released; eg:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
git branch $ISISBRANCH
----

* Create a worktree for this branch:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
git worktree add ../isis-release $ISISBRANCH
----

* Switch to the new worktree and push the branch:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
cd ../isis-release
git push origin $ISISBRANCH -u
----


=== Bump code to `$ISISREL`

Search through the `.java` files for `{page-isisprev}`, and change to `{page-isisrel}`.

At the time of writing there was just one `.java` file that had the release hard-coded (`IsisConfigurationLegacy`).


=== Switch to the `isis-parent` directory

The remainder of the release process is performed from the context of the `isis-parent` directory:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
cd isis-parent
----

=== Bump projects to `$ISISREL`

We use `mvn versions:set` to manually bump the release version.
(After release, there is a xref:comguide:ROOT:cutting-a-release.adoc#reset-revision-property[similar step at the end] to reset back to a `-SNAPSHOT` version).

(Still in the `isis-parent` directory), the steps are:

* First we bump the framework's `pom.xml` files:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=$ISISREL
----

* next we build the framework so that these versioned `pom.xml` files are available for the next step:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
mvn install -o -DskipTests -Dreleased
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The `released` system property is set to only sanity check the modules actually to be released (ignores the incubator modules).

Partly that's because there's no need to check the incubator modules, it's also because the incubator modules might require more recent versions of Java than that formally supported by the framework (Java 11 currently).
====

* next we also update the starters (as used by applications built using the framework):
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
pushd ../starters
mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=$ISISREL
mvn install -DskipTests -o
popd
----

* finally we commit the changes:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----

git add ..
git commit -m "$ISISJIRA: bumps version to $ISISREL"
----



=== Sanity check

Perform one last sanity check on the codebase.
Delete all Isis artifacts from your local Maven repo, then build using the `-o` offline flag:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
rm -rf ~/.m2/repository/org/apache/isis
mvn clean install -o -Dreleased
git clean -dfx ..
----


=== Deploy

Since the `<version>` has already been updated, we just use `mvn deploy` to upload the artifacts.
We activate the (inherited) `apache-release` profile to bring in the `gpg` plugin for code signing.

The build creates a zip of the directory, so before executing the release we remove any other files.

Still in the `isis-parent` directory, we deploy (upload the artifacts) using:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
mvn deploy \
    -Dapache-release \
    -Dgit \
    -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true    #<.>
----
<.> generation of Javadoc is broken as of 2.0.0-M6; see note below.

When prompted, enter your GPG passphrase.
(Or, it might be sufficient to add just `-Dgpg.passphrase="..."`)

[WARNING]
.javadoc generation
====
As of 2.0.0-M6 javadoc generation is broken, due to link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MJAVADOC-586[MJAVADOC-586].

Fixing the issue requires performing the build using a more recent version of the JDK than JDK11.
However, this in turn requires module paths to be properly fixed; see link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ISIS-2841[ISIS-2841] for some ideas.
====



=== Tag the Release

Finally, tag the release:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
git tag $ISISART-$ISISREL
git tag $ISISART-$ISISREL-$ISISRC
----


=== Check/Close Staging Repo

The `mvn deploy` commands will have uploaded all of the release artifacts into a newly created staging repository on the ASF Nexus repository server.

Log onto http://repository.apache.org[repository.apache.org] (using your ASF LDAP account):

image::release-process/nexus-staging-0.png[width="600px"]

And then check that the release has been staged (select `staging repositories` from left-hand side):

image::release-process/nexus-staging-1.png[width="600px"]

If nothing appears in a staging repo you should stop here and work out why.

Assuming that the repo has been populated, make a note of its repo id; this is needed for the voting thread.
In the screenshot above the id is `org.apache.isis-008`.

After checking that the staging repository contains the artifacts that you expect you should close the staging repository.
This will make it available so that people can check the release.

Press the Close button and complete the dialog:

image::release-process/nexus-staging-2.png[width="600px"]

Nexus should start the process of closing the repository.

image::release-process/nexus-staging-2a.png[width="600px"]

All being well, the close should (eventually) complete successfully (keep hitting refresh):

image::release-process/nexus-staging-3.png[width="600px"]

The Nexus repository manager will also email you with confirmation of a successful close.

If Nexus has problems with the key signature, however, then the close will be aborted:

image::release-process/nexus-staging-4.png[width="600px"]

Use `gpg --keyserver hkp://pgp.mit.edu --recv-keys nnnnnnnn` to confirm that the key is available.

[NOTE]
====
Unfortunately, Nexus does not seem to allow subkeys to be used for signing.
See xref:comguide:ROOT:key-generation.adoc[Key Generation] for more details.
====

[#reset-revision-property]
=== Reset `revision` property

At the <<bump-code-to-isisrel,beginning>> of the release process we bumped the version to the release version, ie `$ISISREL`.
With the release now deployed we now need to reset the revision back down to the base snapshot, ie `2.0.0-SNAPSHOT`.

[NOTE]
====
Bumping back to `2.0.0-SNAPSHOT` (rather than the next development snapshot) simplifies CI/CD scripts for teams that want to building Apache Isis from source using git submodules.
====

Therefore (still in the `isis-parent` directory):

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=2.0.0-SNAPSHOT
mvn install -DskipTests -o -Dreleased

pushd ../starters
mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=2.0.0-SNAPSHOT
mvn install -DskipTests -o
popd

git add ..
git commit -m "$ISISJIRA: resetting version"
----

=== Push branch & tag

Push the release branch to origin:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
git push -u origin $ISISBRANCH
----

and also push tag:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
git push origin refs/tags/isis-$ISISREL:refs/tags/isis-$ISISREL-$ISISRC
git fetch
----

[NOTE]
====
The remote tags aren't visible locally but can be seen link:https://github.com/apache/isis/tags[online].
====

[#update-starter-apps]
== Update starter apps

For each of the two starter apps, we maintain four branches:

* `jdo` and `jpa`
+
These are intended to reference the _most recently released_ version, the first demonstrating persistence using JDO, the second using JPA.
These are the branches referenced from the home page and getting started pages of the website.

* `jdo-SNAPSHOT` and `jpa-SNAPSHOT`
+
These reference the most current snapshot nightly build.

The general idea is that a release will fast-forward `jdo` to `jdo-SNAPSHOT` and similarly moves `jpa` up to `jpa-SNAPSHOT`, bumping to the newly released version of the framework in the process.

In order that we don't break the starter apps while a release is being voted on, we do the changes in work branches, `$ISISBRANCH-jdo` and `$ISISBRANCH-jpa`:

* for _helloworld_, we create a release branch for both variants:

** for `jdo`:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
git checkout jdo-SNAPSHOT
git pull --ff-only

git checkout -b $ISISBRANCH-jdo

mvn versions:update-parent -DparentVersion=$ISISREL # <.>
mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=$ISISREL

mvn clean install -o
mvn spring-boot:run
----
+
<.> the top-level `pom.xml` references the ASF staging repository, so this will pull down the release if not already present in `~/.m2/repository`.
+
Commit any changes and then push the branch to origin:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
git add .
git commit -m "$ISISJIRA - updates to $ISISREL (jdo)"
git push -u origin $ISISBRANCH-jdo
----

** repeat for `jpa`:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
git checkout jpa-SNAPSHOT
git pull --ff-only

git checkout -b $ISISBRANCH-jpa

mvn versions:update-parent -DparentVersion=$ISISREL
mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=$ISISREL

mvn clean install -o
mvn spring-boot:run
----
+
Commit any changes and then push the branch to origin:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
git add .
git commit -m "$ISISJIRA - updates to $ISISREL (jpa)"
git push -u origin $ISISBRANCH-jpa
----

* for _simple app_, the steps are almost the same:

** for `jdo`:
+
--

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
git checkout jdo-SNAPSHOT
git pull --ff-only

git checkout -b $ISISBRANCH-jdo

mvn versions:update-parent -DparentVersion=$ISISREL # <.>
mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=$ISISREL

mvn clean install -Dmetamodel.lockdown -B -o        # <.>
----

<.> the top-level `pom.xml` references the ASF staging repository, so this will pull down the release if not already present in `~/.m2/repository`.
<.> the -B flag is required to avoid control characters in generated output

Approve any failed lockdown tests (the mavendeps will fail first time around because the dependencies on Apache Isis itself have just be bumped).

You could also check the output of the Cucumber tests, under:

*** `webapp-tests/target/cucumber-reports` and
*** `webapp-tests/target/cucumber-html-reports`.


Repeat, then run the app as a sanity check:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
mvn -pl webapp spring-boot:run
----

Commit any changes and then push the branch to origin:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
git add .
git commit -m "$ISISJIRA - updates to $ISISREL (jdo)"
git push -u origin $ISISBRANCH-jdo
----
--

** repeat for `jpa`:
+
--

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
git checkout jpa-SNAPSHOT
git pull --ff-only

git checkout -b $ISISBRANCH-jpa

mvn versions:update-parent -DparentVersion=$ISISREL
mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=$ISISREL

mvn clean install -Dmetamodel.lockdown -B -o
----

Approve any failed lockdown tests (the mavendeps will fail first time around because the dependencies on Apache Isis itself have just be bumped).

Repeat, then run the app as a sanity check:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
mvn -pl webapp spring-boot:run
----

Commit any changes and then push the branch to origin:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
git add .
git commit -m "$ISISJIRA - updates to $ISISREL (jpa)"
git push -u origin $ISISBRANCH-jpa
----

--


== Preview website

We also prepare a preview of the next version of the website, then made accessible from link:https://isis.staged.apache.org[].

* Prerequisites:

** clone the link:https://github.com/apache/isis-site[] repo, alongside the `isis` repo:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
git clone https://github.com/apache/isis-site ../isis-site
----

** in the `isis-site` repo, check out the `asf-staging` branch:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
cd ../isis-site

git checkout asf-staging
git pull --ff-only
----

* still in the `isis-site` repo, delete all the files in `content/` _except_ for the `schema` and `versions` directories:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
pushd content
for a in $(ls -1 | grep -v schema | grep -v versions)
do
    rm -rf $a
done
popd
----

* Back in the `isis` repo's `release` worktree, generate the Antora site (from the top-level directory).
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
cd ../isis-release

sh preview.sh
----

* Copy the generated Antora site to `isis-site` repo's `contents` directory:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
cp -Rf antora/target/site/* ../isis-site/content/.
----

* Back in the `isis-site` repo, commit the changes and preview:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
cd ../isis-site

git add .
git commit -m "$ISISJIRA : staging changes to website"

sh preview.sh
----

* If happy, then push the changes:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
git push origin asf-staging -u
----

Wait a minute or two; the site should be available at link:https://isis.staged.apache.org[]  (nb: 'staged', not 'staging').



== Voting

Once the artifacts have been uploaded, you can call a vote.

In all cases, votes last for 72 hours and require a +3 (binding) vote from members.


=== Start voting thread on dev mailing list

That is, link:mailto:dev@apache.isis.org[]

The following boilerplate is for a release of the Apache Isis Core.
Adapt as required:

Use the following subject, eg:

[source,subs="attributes+"]
----
[VOTE] Apache Isis Core release {page-isisrel} RC1
----

And use the following body:

[source,subs="attributes+"]
----
I've just cut a new release of the Apache Isis Framework.

The source code zip artifact has been uploaded to a staging repository on
https://repository.apache.org, along with its corresponding .asc signature.

In the source code repo the code has been tagged as isis-{page-isisrel}-RC1;
see https://github.com/apache/isis/tags

To verify the source code itself, you can use the following commands
(in an empty directory):

----------------------------------------------------------------
include::partial$verify-process.adoc[]
----------------------------------------------------------------

You can then test the helloworld or simpleapp starter apps, see:
https://isis.staged.apache.org/comguide/latest/verifying-releases.html.

You can also inspect the website in general, available at:
https://isis.staged.apache.org.

Please verify the release and cast your vote.
The vote will be open for a minimum of 72 hours.

[ ] +1
[ ]  0
[ ] -1
----

Remember to update:

* the version number (`{page-isisrel}` or whatever)
* the release candidate number (`RC1` or whatever)
* the `NEXUSREPONUM` to the repository id as provided by Nexus earlier (`11xx` or whatever)

Note that the email also references the procedure for other committers to xref:comguide:ROOT:verifying-releases.adoc[verify the release].
