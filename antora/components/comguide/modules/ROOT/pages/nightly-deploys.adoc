This page describes how we deploy the xref:docs:starters:simpleapp.adoc[], xref:docs:starters:helloworld.adoc[HelloWorld App] and the xref:reference:about.adoc[] each night, to a Azure App Container Apps (a PaaS based on top of k8s).

The actual CI jobs can be found in the link:https://github.com/apache-causeway-committers/causeway-nightly-deploys[apache-causeway-committers/causeway-nightly-deploys] repo.

== Azure Container Apps

Following link:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/container-apps/get-started?ocid=AID3042118&tabs=bash[azure docs] for ACA

=== Prereqs

* link:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli[install Azure CLI]

=== Authenticate

Authenticate and prepare working environment

* login
+
[source,bash]
----
az login
----
+
Confirm using web browser.

* add ACA extension
+
[source,bash]
----
az extension add --name containerapp --upgrade
----
+
This takes a minute or two.

* register the `Microsoft.OperationalInsights` provider for the Azure Monitor Log Analytics workspace
+
[source,bash]
----
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.OperationalInsights
----
+
(as have not used it before).



=== Setup the resource group and ACA environment

In Azure, all resources live in resource groups.
We will use a single resource group.

One of the resources to be set up is an ACA environment, which creates a secure boundary around a group of container apps.
Container Apps deployed to the same environment are deployed in the same virtual network and write logs to the same Log Analytics workspace.
We will use a single ACA environment.

Create a resource group to organize the services related to the container apps.

* set these environment variables:
+
[source,bash]
----
RESOURCE_GROUP="causeway-nightlies-rg"
LOCATION="uksouth"
CONTAINERAPPS_ENVIRONMENT="causeway-nightlies-aca-env"
----

* create the resource group
+
[source,bash]
----
az group create \
  --name $RESOURCE_GROUP \
  --location $LOCATION
----
+
resulting in:
+
[source,bash]
----
{
  "id": "/subscriptions/XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX/resourceGroups/causeway-nightlies-rg",
  "location": "ukwest",
  "managedBy": null,
  "name": "causeway-nightlies-rg",
  "properties": {
    "provisioningState": "Succeeded"
  },
  "tags": null,
  "type": "Microsoft.Resources/resourceGroups"
}
----

* next, create the ACA environment:
+
[source,bash]
----
az containerapp env create \
  --name $CONTAINERAPPS_ENVIRONMENT \
  --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
  --location $LOCATION
----
+
resulting in:
+
[source,bash]
----
No Log Analytics workspace provided.
Generating a Log Analytics workspace with name "workspace-causewaynightliesrgT0WN"

== Create Container App

We will create a container app manually.
Later, in the <<#automation,automation>> section, we will simply update the container (replacing the image with a new one).

We'll start with the link:https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/apache/causeway-app-demo-jpa[apache/causeway-app-demo-jpa] Docker image:

* set further environment variables:
+
[source,bash]
----
APP_NAME="demo-wicket-jpa"
IMAGE_NAME="apache/causeway-demo-jpa"
IMAGE_VERSION="2.0.0-M9.20221018-1911-d3980668"
----

* create the app
+
include::partial$az-containerapp-create.adoc[]
+
resulting in:
+
[source,bash]
----
Container app created. Access your app at https://demo-wicket-jpa.graytree-90c75749.uksouth.azurecontainerapps.io/
----

* Change scaling from default (1-10) to just a single instance.

== Use Lets Encrypt for SSL Certs

as per: link:https://dev.to/shibayan/how-to-quickly-setup-a-lets-encrypt-certificate-in-azure-container-apps-3nd7[this blog post] blog, the link:https://github.com/shibayan/containerapps-acmebot[shibayan/containerapps-acmebot] repo provides an Azure deployment that handles the LetsEncrypt certificates.

Following its link:https://github.com/shibayan/containerapps-acmebot/wiki/Getting-Started[Getting-Started] README:

=== DNS management

Created DNS zone for `causeway.dev`, and then a child zone `apps.causeway.dev`.

NOTE: the intention is to change this to a more suitable domain.


=== Deploy the Services

* from the link:https://github.com/shibayan/containerapps-acmebot/wiki/Getting-Started#1-deploy-acmebot[README]:
+
image::nightly-deploys/image-2023-01-03-17-58-33-718.png[width=600]

* add params:
+
image::nightly-deploys/image-2023-01-03-18-07-57-499.png[width=800]
+
results in:
+
image::nightly-deploys/image-2023-01-03-18-10-33-567.png[width=800]


=== Enable App Service Authentication & Access control (IAM)

Continuing with the link:https://github.com/shibayan/containerapps-acmebot/wiki/Getting-Started#3-enable-app-service-authentication[README]:

* add an identity provider to the function app:
+
image::nightly-deploys/image-2023-01-03-18-16-01-614.png[width=800]

* add contributor role assignment:
+
image::nightly-deploys/image-2023-01-03-18-22-59-542.png[width=1000]


=== Access function app

Continuing further with the link:https://github.com/shibayan/containerapps-acmebot/wiki/Getting-Started#5-access-to-function-app[README]:

* locate the name of the function app (`func-acmebot-y3a6` above)

* navigate to link:https://func-acmebot-y3a6.azurewebsites.net/add-certificate[], and grant permissions to access the site:
+
image::nightly-deploys/image-2023-01-03-18-27-32-832.png[width=300]


* complete dialog:
+
image::nightly-deploys/image-2023-01-04-06-23-41-099.png[width=600]
+
and `Submit`.

* The docs say "after a few tens of seconds, the certificate will be issued".
Indeed so:
+
image::nightly-deploys/image-2023-01-04-06-26-42-960.png[width=400]
+
In the DNS zone, it creates this `TXT` record:
+
image::nightly-deploys/image-2023-01-04-06-29-02-083.png[width=600]

* Also create a `CNAME` for the app:
+
image::nightly-deploys/image-2023-01-04-06-25-56-926.png[width=400]

* Confirm that the app can be accessed:
+
image::nightly-deploys/image-2023-01-04-06-31-36-293.png[width=800]


== Deploy Remaining Apps

For each app, the steps are:

* Set common environment variables
+
[source,bash]
----
RESOURCE_GROUP="causeway-nightlies-rg"
CONTAINERAPPS_ENVIRONMENT="causeway-nightlies-aca-env"
----

* Set app-specific environment variables

* Create the container app
* Manually configure scaling
* Manually setup `CNAME` record in `apps.causeway.dev` DNS zone

== Automation

With all of the applications created above, the nightly automation simply needs to update the apps with new images, using `az container revision copy`.
There is *_no need_* to create ACA environments etc from scratch.

=== Prereqs

We require an Azure Service Principal for the CI/CD job to use.

Following https://dev.to/erudinsky/how-to-deploy-to-azure-with-gitlab-authentication-credentials-store-runner-config-yaml-pipeline-example-37bp[this blog post] and also https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/create-an-azure-service-principal-azure-cli#password-based-authentication[MS docs]:

* https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal#register-an-application-with-azure-ad-and-create-a-service-principal[register an application]
+
My guess is that this is a 'deploy' application rather than the application being deployed.
+
