:page-partial:

As part of the release process we xref:post-release-successful.adoc#generate-website[generate] and publish the website.
An (intentional) side-effect of this process is to create a branch for the release (that is, `{page-isisrel}`).
This branch can then be used for documentation updates.

== Update docs

In the regular `isis` repo:

* Check out the branch:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
git checkout {page-isisrel}
----

* make documentation updates, and commit changes

* generate the website:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
sh preview.sh
----
+
This will write to `antora/target/site`; we'll use the results in the xref:#publish-website[next section].
+
NOTE: this requires Java 11 for the projdoc tooling.
