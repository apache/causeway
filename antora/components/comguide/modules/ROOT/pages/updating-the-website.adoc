To page describes how to update the website _between_ releases.

As part of the release process we xref:post-release-successful.adoc#generate-website[generate] and publish the website.

An (intentional) side-effect of this process is to create a branch for the release (that is, `{page-causewayreleaseversion}`).
This branch can then be used for documentation updates.


If we need to make a change:

* make the change on `main` as normal (so that the docs will be there for the next release)
* cherry-pick the changes onto these documentation branches.

Then publish as per the main release process:

* xref:comguide:ROOT:post-release-successful.adoc#generate-the-site[generate the site]
* xref:comguide:ROOT:post-release-successful.adoc#publish-website[publish the site].
* xref:comguide:ROOT:post-release-successful.adoc#update-the-algolia-search-index[update the algolia search index]


Prereqs (software and doc tooling) are summarised in xref:comguide:ROOT:release-process-prereqs.adoc[].
