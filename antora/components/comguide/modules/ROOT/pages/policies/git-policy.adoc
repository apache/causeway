These notes recommend how contributors should work with git.
To understand these notes, the only real concepts that you need to grok are:

* git commits form an acyclic graph, with each commit pointing to its parent commit (or commit**s**, if a merge)

* a branch is merely a pointer to one of these commits; git calls the main branch `master`

* git commits happen in two steps: first they are added to the index (also called the staging area), then they are committed.

For more background reading, see:

* http://git-scm.com/book[Pro Git] book (free in electronic form)
* https://github.s3.amazonaws.com/media/book.pdf[Git community book]
* http://git-scm.com/2011/07/11/reset.html[git reset demystified] - differentiating the working directory vs index/staging area

And, of course, there is loads of good advice on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/git[stackoverflow.com]

== Workflow

There are many ways of using Git, but the Apache Isis committers have adopted the following workflow:

* create a topic branch for a feature +
+
[source,bash]
----
git checkout -b ISIS-999
----

* periodically, push the branch to origin (for safekeeping): +
+
[source,bash]
----
git push origin ISIS-999
----

* `rebase` the topic branch periodically on master. +
+ How often you do this will depend on whether you are collaborating with others on the feature.
You need to ensure that your co-worker has no outstanding work before you do this; otherwise it'll create merge conflict hell for them:
+
[source,bash]
----
git checkout master
git pull
git checkout ISIS-999
git rebase master
git push origin ISIS-999 --force
----

* when feature is complete, rebase once more (as above), then switch to master and perform a `merge --no-ff`: +
+
[source,bash]
----
git checkout master
git merge --no-ff ISIS-999
----

* finally, remove the branch +
+
[source,bash]
----
git branch -d ISIS-999
git push origin --delete ISIS-999
----

This way of working gives us the full history on the branch as to what the thought processes were for the feature, but only a single commit on to `master` to see the ultimate impact of the changes (acting a bit like a summary).

== Commit message

The minimum we expect in a commit messages is:

[source,bash]
----
ISIS-nnn: brief summary here

- optionally, longer details
- should be written here
- in bullet points
----

where `ISIS-nnn` is a ticket raised in our https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ISIS[JIRA issue tracker].

For non-committers we typically expect more detail again; see the xref:conguide:ROOT:contributing.adoc[contributing] page for the longer format recommended for contributors to use.
