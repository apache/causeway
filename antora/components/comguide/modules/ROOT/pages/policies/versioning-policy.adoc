== Semantic Versioning

Starting from v1.0.0, Apache Isis has adopted link:http://semver.org[semantic versioning] for its versioning policy.

Version numbers are in the form `x.y.z`:

* x is bumped up whenever there a breaking API change
* y is bumped up whenever there is a new feature that does not break API
* z is bumped up for minor bug fixes.

This scheme would be adopted for both core and components.

== Version ranges

Version ranges may not be used.
If necessary, end-users can use `<dependencyManagement>` elements to have combine components built against different versions of core.

That said, this can introduce instability and so generally we recommend that end-users configure the `maven-enforcer-plugin` and its link:http://maven.apache.org/enforcer/enforcer-rules/dependencyConvergence.html[DependencyConvergence] rule.
This will help avoid "jar hell" (components having conflicting dependencies of core).

If there is a conflict, we would ask that end-users engage with Apache Isis committers to have an updated version of the component(s) pushed out.
