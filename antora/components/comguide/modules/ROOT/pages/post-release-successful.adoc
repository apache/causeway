The release process consists of:

* the release manager xref:comguide:ROOT:cutting-a-release.adoc[cutting the release]

* members of the Apache Isis PMC xref:comguide:ROOT:verifying-releases.adoc[verifying] and voting on the release

* the release manager performing post-release tasks, for either a successful or an xref:comguide:ROOT:post-release-unsuccessful.adoc[unsuccessful] vote (former documented below)

For a vote to succeed, there must be +3 votes from PMC members, and the vote must have been open at least 72 hours.
If there are not +3 votes after this time then it is perfectly permissible to keep the vote open longer.

This section describes the steps to perform if the vote has been successful.

== Inform dev ML

Post the results to the `dev@isis.a.o` mailing list:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
[RESULT] [VOTE] Apache Isis Core release {isisnext}
----

using the body (alter last line as appropriate):

[source,bash]
----
The vote has completed with the following result :

  +1 (binding): ... list of names ...
  +1 (non binding): ... list of names ...

  -1 (binding): ... list of names ...
  -1 (non binding): ... list of names ...

The vote is SUCCESSFUL.

I'll now go ahead and complete the post-release activities.
----

== Update tags

Replace the `-RCn` tag with another without the qualifier.

You can do this using the `scripts/promoterctag.sh` script; for example:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
sh scripts/promoterctag.sh isis-{isisnext} RC1
----

This script pushes the tag under `refs/tags/rel`.
As per Apache policy (communicated on 10th Jan 2016 to Apache PMCs), this path is 'protected' and is unmodifiable (guaranteeing the provenance that the ASF needs for releases).

Then, continue onto the next section for the steps to promote and announce the release.

== Release to Maven Central

From the http://repository.apache.org[ASF Nexus repository], select the staging repository and select 'release' from the top menu.


image::release-process/nexus-release-1.png[width="600px",link="{imagesdir}/release-process/nexus-release-1.png"]

This moves the release artifacts into an Apache releases repository; from there they will be automatically moved to the Maven repository.

== Release Source Zip

As described in the link:http://www.apache.org/dev/release-publishing.html#distribution_dist[Apache documentation], each Apache TLP has a `release/TLP-name` directory in the distribution Subversion repository at link:https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist[https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist].
Once a release vote passes, the release manager should `svn add` the artifacts (plus signature and hash files) into this location.
The release is then automatically pushed to http://www.apache.org/dist/[http://www.apache.org/dist/] by `svnpubsub`.
Only the most recent release of each supported release line should be contained here, old versions should be deleted.

Each project is responsible for the structure of its directory.
The directory structure of Apache Isis reflects the directory structure in our git source code repo:

[source]
----
isis/
  core/
----

If necessary, checkout this directory structure:

[source,bash]
----
svn co https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/isis isis-dist
----

Next, add the new release into the appropriate directory, and delete any previous release.
The `upd.sh` script (also downloadable from link:https://gist.github.com/danhaywood/aa79c18d993df1b1e2c5a9933e48bcbc[this gist]) can be used to automate this:

[source,bash]
----
old_ver=$1
new_ver=$2


# constants
repo_root=https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/releases/org/apache/isis

zip="source-release.zip"
asc="$zip.asc"
md5="$zip.md5"


#
# isis-core
#
type="core"
fullname="isis"
pushd isis-core

curl -O $repo_root/$type/$fullname/$new_ver/$fullname-$new_ver-$asc
svn add $fullname-$new_ver-$asc
curl -O $repo_root/$type/$fullname/$new_ver/$fullname-$new_ver-$md5
svn add $fullname-$new_ver-$md5
curl -O $repo_root/$type/$fullname/$new_ver/$fullname-$new_ver-$zip
svn add $fullname-$new_ver-$zip

svn delete $fullname-$old_ver-$asc
svn delete $fullname-$old_ver-$md5
svn delete $fullname-$old_ver-$zip

popd

----

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
sh upd.sh {isiscurr} {isisnext}
----

The script downloads the artifacts from the Nexus release repository, adds the artifacts to subversion and deletes the previous version.

Double check that the files are correct; there is sometimes a small delay in the files becoming available in the release repository.
It should be sufficient to check just the `md5` or `.asc` files that these look valid (aren't HTML 404 error pages):

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
vi `find . -name *.md5`
----

Assuming all is good, commit the changes:

[source,subs="attributes+"]
----
svn commit -m "publishing isis source releases to dist.apache.org"
----

If the files are invalid, then revert using `svn revert . --recursive` and try again in a little while.

== Update JIRA

=== Generate Release Notes

From the root directory, generate the release notes for the current release, in Asciidoc format; eg:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
sh scripts/jira-release-notes.sh ISIS {isisnext} > /tmp/1
----

[NOTE]
====
This script uses 'jq' to parse JSON.
See the script itself for details of how to install this utility.
====

=== Close tickets

Close all JIRA tickets for the release, or moved to future releases if not yet addressed.
Any tickets that were partially implemented should be closed, and new tickets created for the functionality on the ticket not yet implemented.

=== Mark the version as released

In JIRA, go to the link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/plugins/servlet/project-config/ISIS/versions[administration section] for the Apache Isis project and update the version as being released.

In the link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=87[Kanban view] this will have the effect of marking all tickets as released (clearing the "done" column).

=== Create new JIRA

Create a new JIRA ticket as a catch-all for the _next_ release.

=== Update the ASF Reporter website

Log the new release in the link:https://reporter.apache.org/addrelease.html?isis[ASF Reporter website].


== Update website

WARNING: TODO - v2 - need to update for Antora process.
See also (or x-ref) the xref:antora-publish-procedure.adoc[antora publish procedure] section, also in this guide.

In the main `isis` repo (ie containing the asciidoc source):

* Paste in the JIRA-generated release notes generated above, adding to top of `antora/components/relnotes/modules/ROOT/pages/about.adoc`.
+
Also add a summary line for the release.

* Update the [`site.yml`] file that declares the current and next releases.

* update the `doap_isis.rdf` file (which provides a machine-parseable description of the project) with details of the new release.
Validate using the http://www.w3.org/RDF/Validator/[W3C RDF Validator] service.
+
For more information on DOAP files, see these http://projects.apache.org/doap.html[Apache policy docs].

* Update the link:https://github.com/apache/isis/blob/master/STATUS[STATUS] file (in root of Apache Isis' source) should be updated with details of the new release.

* commit the `.adoc` changes

Now we need to publish the website:

* locate `template/document.html.erb` file, and remove `-SNAPSHOT` from the navbar, so that it reads something like:
+
[source,html,subs="attributes+"]
----
<p class="nav navbar-text navbar-right small">{isisnext}</p>
----

* publish to the `isis-site` repo.
+
This will have published to the `SNAPSHOT` directory of the `isis-site` repo.

Now, in the `isis-site` repo itself:

* double check that a copy of `current` exists as a named directory under `content/versions`
+
If for any reason it isn't there, then create a copy (under `content/versions`) before it gets deleted in the step below.

* delete the `current` version and then rename the just-published `SNAPSHOT` as `current`:
+
[source,bash]
----
rm -rf content/versions/current
mv content/versions/SNAPSHOT content/versions/current
----

* take a copy of the new `current` version as its appropriately named version:
+
For example:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
cp -rf content/versions/current content/versions/{isisnext}
----

* update the new named version's `index.html` with one that will redirect back to the home page.
+
You can take a copy from one of the older named versions, or just use this text:
+
[source,html]
----
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Redirecting to index.html</title>
        <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="1; URL=../../index.html">
        <meta name="keywords" content="automatic redirection">
        </head>
    <body>
        Redirecting to <a href="../../index.html">index.html</a>...
    </body>
</html>
----

* In the home page's index page (`content/index.html`):

** update the menu to reference the new version

At this point the files in the root (directly under `content`) will still be out of date; the publish process simply preserves whatever is in `content/versions/current`.
Also, the `SNAPSHOT` will be missing (above it was renamed to `current`).
And, we also need to make sure that any future publishing of snapshots has the correct version in the navbar.

Therefore:

* locate `template/document.html.erb` file, and add in `-SNAPSHOT` for version in the navbar:
+
[source,html,subs="attributes+"]
----
<p class="nav navbar-text navbar-right small">{isisnextafter}-SNAPSHOT</p>
----

* publish the website once more (from the `isis` main repo).

* Finally, preview the changes (using `sh preview.sh` in the `isis-site`).

If everything looks ok, then push the changes to make live.

== Announce the release

Announce the release to link:mailto:users@isis.apache.org[users mailing list].

For example, for a release of Apache Isis Core, use the following subject:

[source,subs="attributes+"]
----
[ANN] Apache Isis version {isisnext} Released
----

And use the following body (summarizing the main points as required):

[source,subs="attributes+"]
----
The Apache Isis team is pleased to announce the release of Apache Isis {isisnext}.

New features in this release include:
* ...

Full release notes are available on the Apache Isis website at [1].
Please also read the migration notes [2].

You can access this release directly from the Maven central repo [3].
Alternatively, download the release and build it from source [4].

Enjoy!

[2] http://isis.apache.org/downloads/mn/about.html#_migration-notes_{isiscurr}-to-{isisnext}
[3] http://search.maven.org
[4] http://isis.apache.org/downloads.html
----

== Blog post

link:https://blogs.apache.org/roller-ui/login.rol[Log onto] the http://blogs.apache.org/isis/[Apache blog] and create a new post.
Copy-n-paste the above mailing list announcement should suffice.

== Merge in release branch

Because we release from a branch, the changes made in the branch (changes to `pom.xml` made by the `maven-release-plugin`, or any manual edits) should be merged back from the release branch back into the `master` branch:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
git checkout master                           # update master with latest
git pull
git merge release-{isisnext}-RC1                  # merge branch onto master
git push origin --delete release-{isisnext}-RC1   # remote branch no longer needed
git branch -d release-{isisnext}-RC1              # branch no longer needed
----

== Update dependencies

With the release complete, now is a good time to bump versions of dependencies (so that there is a full release cycle to identify any possible issues).

You will probably want to create a new JIRA ticket for these updates (or if minor then use the "catch-all" JIRA ticket raised earlier for the next release).

=== Update parent of Core

Check (via link:http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22org.apache%22%20a%3A%22apache%22[search.maven.org]) whether there is a newer version of the Apache parent `org.apache:apache`.

If there is, update the `&lt;version&gt;` in the `&lt;parent&gt;` element in the parent POM to match the newer version:

[source,xml]
----
<parent>
    <groupId>org.apache</groupId>
    <artifactId>apache</artifactId>
    <version>NN</version>
    <relativePath />
</parent>
----

where `NN` is the updated version number.

=== Update plugin versions

The `maven-versions-plugin` should be used to determine if there are newer versions of any of the plugins used to build Apache Isis.
Since this goes off to the internet, it may take a minute or two to run:

[source,bash]
----
mvn versions:display-plugin-updates > /tmp/foo
grep "\->" /tmp/foo | /bin/sort -u
----

Review the generated output and make updates as you see fit.
(However, if updating, please check by searching for known issues with newer versions).

=== Update dependency versions

The `maven-versions-plugin` should be used to determine if there are newer versions of any of Isis' dependencies.
Since this goes off to the internet, it may take a minute or two to run:

[source,bash]
----
mvn versions:display-dependency-updates > /tmp/foo
grep "\->" /tmp/foo | /bin/sort -u
----

Update any of the dependencies that are out-of-date.
That said, do note that some dependencies may show up with a new dependency, when in fact the dependency is for an old, badly named version.
Also, there may be new dependencies that you do not wish to move to, eg release candidates or milestones.

For example, here is a report showing both of these cases:

[source,bash]
----
[INFO]   asm:asm ..................................... 3.3.1 -> 20041228.180559
[INFO]   commons-httpclient:commons-httpclient .......... 3.1 -> 3.1-jbossorg-1
[INFO]   commons-logging:commons-logging ......... 1.1.1 -> 99.0-does-not-exist
[INFO]   dom4j:dom4j ................................. 1.6.1 -> 20040902.021138
[INFO]   org.datanucleus:datanucleus-api-jdo ................ 3.1.2 -> 3.2.0-m1
[INFO]   org.datanucleus:datanucleus-core ................... 3.1.2 -> 3.2.0-m1
[INFO]   org.datanucleus:datanucleus-jodatime ............... 3.1.1 -> 3.2.0-m1
[INFO]   org.datanucleus:datanucleus-rdbms .................. 3.1.2 -> 3.2.0-m1
[INFO]   org.easymock:easymock ................................... 2.5.2 -> 3.1
[INFO]   org.jboss.resteasy:resteasy-jaxrs ............. 2.3.1.GA -> 3.0-beta-1
----

For these artifacts you will need to search http://search.maven.org[Maven central repo] directly yourself to confirm there are no newer dependencies not shown in this list.

== Code formatting

This is also a good time to make source code has been cleaned up and formatted according to the Apache Isis and ASF conventions.
Use link:../dg/resources/eclipse/Apache-code-style-formatting.xml[this] Eclipse template and link:../dg/resources/eclipse/isis.importorder[this] import order.

== Push changes

Finally, push the changes up to origin:

[source,bash]
----
git fetch    # check no new commits on origin/master
git push
----

== Release (non-ASF) Modules

The (non-ASF) link:https://platform.incode.org[Incode Platform^] should also be released, as per their link:https://platform.incode.org/pages/committers-guide/committers-guide.html#_release_to_maven_central[release guide].
