== Simpleapp Maintenance (JDO and JPA)

When making updates for simpleapp, use the following process:

=== If the change applies to released (M5):

. make change to jdo, then merge down to jdo-SNAPSHOT
. also merge jdo -> jpa, and fix any persistence differences if nec.
. then merge jpa -> jpa-SNAPSHOT
. finally, merge jdo-SNAPSHOT -> jpa-SNAPSHOT (should be a no-op)

Doing it this way makes it easy to keep the branches in sync.

=== If the change applies to snapshot (M6), then its similar but shorter:

. make change to jdo-SNAPSHOT
. merge jdo-SNAPSHOT to jpa-SNAPSHOT, and fix any persistence differences

[NOTE]
----
If you do want to update the antora docs and have them updated on-line, then the procedure is to check out the released branch (M5) and make changes there.
Then we build and copy over to the apache/isis-site repo to publish up to isis.apache.org.
