== Simpleapp Maintenance (JDO and JPA)

When making updates for simpleapp, to the current snapshot:

. make change to `v2-jpa-SNAPSHOT`
. forward port from `v2-jpa-SNAPSHOT` to `v3-jpa-SNAPSHOT`
. merge down from `v2-jpa-SNAPSHOT` to `v2-jdo-SNAPSHOT`
. forward port from `v2-jdo-SNAPSHOT` to `v3-jdo-SNAPSHOT`
. merge down from `v3-jpa-SNAPSHOT` to `v3-jdo-SNAPSHOT` (should be a no-op)

[NOTE]
====
If you do want to update the antora docs and have them updated on-line, then the procedure is to check out the currently released branch and make changes there.
Then we build and copy over to the `apache/causeway-site` repo to publish up to https://causeway.apache.org.
