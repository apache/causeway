The link:https://github.com/apache/causeway-app-referenceapp[reference app] (previously called the 'demo app') provides an introduction to the Apache Causeway programming model, allowing you to learn the basics with a minimum of hassle.
It's also a useful reference to help you develop your own Apache Causeway applications.

The application is packaged up as a Docker image (link:https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/causeway-app-demo-jpa[apache/causeway-app-demo-jpa] or link:https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/causeway-app-demo-jdo[apache/causeway-app-demo-jdo]) on Docker Hub, so you can easily run it yourself (as described <<Running the Docker Image,below>>).


== Prereqs

Head over to https://www.docker.com/community-edition[Docker] to install the community edition.


== Running the Docker Image

Assuming the `jpa` variant (if using `jdo`, just substitute "jpa" with "jdo" in the commands below):

* Pull and run the Docker Image
+
[source,bash]
----
docker pull apache/causeway-app-demo-jpa:latest
docker run --name demo -d -p8080:8080 apache/causeway-app-demo-jpa:latest
----
+
The app can then be accessed at http://localhost:8080/wicket/[].
Login with `sven:pass`.

* Stop and remove the container named `demo`
+
[source,bash]
----
docker stop demo && docker rm demo
----

=== Customization

The way in which the app is run by Docker be customised in a couple of ways.
Assuming the `jpa` variant (if using `jdo`, just substitute "jpa" with "jdo" in the commands below):

* Prototyping mode
+
----
docker run --name demo -d -p8080:8080 -ePROTOTYPING=true apache/causeway-app-demo-jpa:latest
----

* Specify a different context Path
+
----
docker run -d -p8080:8080 -eContextPath=/myPath apache/causeway-app-demo-jpa:latest
----
+
then access at http://localhost:8080/myPath/wicket/[].
