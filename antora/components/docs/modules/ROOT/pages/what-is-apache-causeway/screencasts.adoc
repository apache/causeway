// TODO: v2: NICE-TO-HAVE: update these screenshots for v2

We've prepared a number of screencasts to help you see what Apache Causeway has to offer.

While these each follow on from each other, you should be able to watch them in any order; the typical duration is
3 minutes.
The number of each screencast (eg 'link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTNHR5EdAs8[001^]') is a link over
to youtube.

Or, if you have a little more time, you can watch the screencasts by playlist.
You can either watch
link:https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbRpnAmQ6xsA-m4d2iwAuWrX1icJz0SnM[ALL] of them one after the other, or you
can use one of the themed playlists to explore particular aspects of the framework.
The table below indicates which screencasts are in which playlist.

[NOTE]
====
These screencasts were recorded using v1.12.x.
There have been a number of UI improvements since these releases.
====


Finally, you can also find some screencasts for earlier versions of the framework link:./screencasts-older.html[here].
