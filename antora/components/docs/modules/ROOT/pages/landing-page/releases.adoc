Each new version of the framework comes with xref:relnotes:ROOT:about.adoc[Release Notes], which new features, improvements and bug fixes.
These usually include migration notes that explain how to migrate to new features / away from deprecated or removed features.


== Updating your App

If your app inherits from the xref:docs:parent-pom:about.adoc[Parent POM], then the easiest way to update to the next release is often as simple as changing the `<version>` in your application's parent `pom.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<parent>
    <groupId>org.apache.isis.app</groupId>
    <artifactId>isis-app-starter-parent</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.0</version>                            <!--1-->
</parent>
----
<1> update as required.


== Nightly Builds

If you like to live on the bleeding edge, there are also nightly builds of the framework.

* link:https://github.com/apache-isis-committers/isis-nightly[CI]
* link:https://repo.incode.cloud/[Maven Repo]
* link:https://apache-isis-committers.github.io/isis-nightly[Website preview]

Although these are maintained and used by the framework's committers, do be aware that *these are _not_ official ASF releases*; they are provided as a convenience only.

== Building from Source

If you want though you can also xref:docs:ROOT:downloads/how-to.adoc[download] the source code and build it directly.
