Each new version of the framework comes with xref:relnotes:ROOT:about.adoc[Release Notes], which new features, improvements and bug fixes.
These usually include migration notes that explain how to migrate to new features / away from deprecated or removed features.


== Updating your App

If your app inherits from the xref:docs:parent-pom:about.adoc[Parent POM], then the easiest way to update to the next release is often as simple as changing the `<version>` in your application's parent `pom.xml`:

[source,xml,subs="attributes+"]
----
<parent>
    <groupId>org.apache.causeway.app</groupId>
    <artifactId>causeway-app-starter-parent</artifactId>
    <version>{page-causewayprevv2}</version> <!--.-->
</parent>
----
<.> update as required.


== Building from Source

You can also xref:docs:ROOT:downloads/how-to.adoc[download] the source code and build it directly.



== Interim Builds

If you want to track the latest developments, there are also xref:comguide:ROOT:nightly-builds.adoc[nightly builds] and xref:comguide:ROOT:weekly-builds.adoc[weekly builds].

Although these are maintained by the frameworkâ€™s committers, do be aware that *these are not official ASF releases*.
