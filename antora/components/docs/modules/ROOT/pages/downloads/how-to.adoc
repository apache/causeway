Apache Causeway&trade; software is a framework for rapidly developing domain-driven apps in Java.
Write your business logic in entities, domain services and repositories, and the framework dynamically generates a representation of that domain model as a webapp or RESTful API.
Use for prototyping or production.




== Getting Started

If you just want to get going quickly, we suggest using our xref:docs:starters:helloworld.adoc[HelloWorld] or xref:docs:starters:simpleapp.adoc[SimpleApp] starter apps.



== Formal Releases

If you want to build Apache Causeway from formally released source tarballs, you can download from here:

* https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/causeway/causeway-core/causeway-{page-causewayreleaseversion}-source-release.zip[causeway-{page-causewayreleaseversion}] (https://www.apache.org/dist/causeway/causeway-core/causeway-{page-causewayreleaseversion}-source-release.zip.asc[asc], https://www.apache.org/dist/causeway/causeway-core/causeway-{page-causewayreleaseversion}-source-release.zip.md5[md5])




=== Verifying Releases

It is essential that you verify the integrity of any downloaded files using the PGP or MD5 signatures.
For more information on signing artifacts and why we do it, check out the http://www.apache.org/dev/release-signing.html[Release Signing FAQ].

The PGP signatures can be verified using PGP or GPG. First download the http://www.apache.org/dist/causeway/KEYS[KEYS] as well as the asc signature file for the artifact.
Make sure you get these files from the http://www.apache.org/dist/causeway/[main distribution directory], rather than from a mirror.

Then verify the signatures using a command such as:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
pgpk -a KEYS
pgpv causeway-{page-causewayreleaseversion}-source-release.zip.asc causeway-{page-causewayreleaseversion}-source-release.zip
----

or

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
pgp -ka KEYS
pgp causeway-{page-causewayreleaseversion}-source-release.zip.asc causeway-{page-causewayreleaseversion}-source-release.zip
----

or

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
gpg --import KEYS
gpg -verify causeway-{page-causewayreleaseversion}-source-release.zip.asc causeway-{page-causewayreleaseversion}-source-release.zip
----



Alternatively, you can verify the MD5 signature on the files.
A Unix/Linux program called `md5` or `md5sum` is included in most distributions.
It is also available as part of http://www.gnu.org/software/textutils/textutils.html[GNU Textutils].
Windows users can get binary md5 programs from these (and likely other) places:

* http://www.md5summer.org/[http://www.md5summer.org/]
* http://www.fourmilab.ch/md5/[http://www.fourmilab.ch/md5/]
* http://www.pc-tools.net/win32/md5sums/[http://www.pc-tools.net/win32/md5sums/]



== Source Code

The Apache Causeway source is hosted on github.
You can download the Apache Causeway source code using:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/apache/causeway.git
----

Contributors can fork this repo using github's tools and contribute patches/new features using pull requests.

Committers can push to this repo directly, once their ASF account and github account have been linked.
See link:https://gitbox.apache.org/setup/[gitbox setup] for more details on how to do this.



== DOAP RDF File

The http://projects.apache.org/doap.html[description of a project] RDF file for Apache Causeway can be downloaded link:https://causeway.apache.org/doap_causeway.rdf[here].



== Interim Builds

If you want to track the latest developments, there are also xref:comguide:ROOT:nightly-builds.adoc[nightly builds] and xref:comguide:ROOT:weekly-builds.adoc[weekly builds].

Although these are maintained by the frameworkâ€™s committers, do be aware that *these are not official ASF releases*.
