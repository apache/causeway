Deciding whether to use a full stack framework such as Apache Isis means in large part determining to what extent the applications you need to develop align with the strengths and philosophy of the framework.

If you have written an app in Apache Isis that you'd like to share, please mention it on the xref:docs:ROOT:support.adoc#[mailing list].
