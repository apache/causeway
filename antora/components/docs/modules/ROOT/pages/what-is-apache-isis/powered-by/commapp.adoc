// TODO: V2: need to update these, they are getting stale.

CommApp is an application whose domain is that of managing businesses themselves, specifically the commercial aspects of a business.
You can get a feel for it from this screenshot:

which shows how the app integrates a number of the (non-ASF) link:https://platform.incode.org[Incode Platform^] components (excel, fullcalendar2, gmap3 and wickedcharts).

== Why Apache Isis?

When making our decision towards a software development framework, we evaluated some few like Spring Framework and Oracle ADF, including a newer semantic framework.
At that point we faced we needed to choose between being locked in to a framework using many of their proprietary classes, methods and other features, or having to write a lot of code even to get things as CURD operations, and we would be facing significant differences in the code if using relational databases or the newer so called NonSQL databases.

So we added Apache Isis to our evaluation, and we found it to be open in many aspects, including an open architecture and auto-generated UI viewer, as well as equally open and auto-generated REST/SOA web services, seamlessly support both SQL and NoSQL through an open and standard http://datanucleus.org[persistence manager], as well as open security (http://shiro.apache.org[Apache Shiro], LDAP) and features such as multi-tenancy.

Our main focus in the code is given to the business domain, with business logic treated as a first class citizen.
And because our code simply uses non-proprietary Java, we've been able to extend it the normal way.
Very little code in our application so far can be considered to be framework-specific, the few that is only because we chose to use some of the (non-ASF) link:https://platform.incode.org[Incode Platform^] modules that provide our applications with high value, and which are open source also.

When creating our prototype and then subsequent application, we've found quite amazing support: most of the time the Isis team provides same day high quality support, with samples and references, which has helped us find the solution to our needs quickly.
The framework is growing rapidly as well, keeping its openness and business domain driven focus.
The tutorials and documentation is quite comprehensive and very clear.
We have found all this hard to find in many other open source frameworks.
