The `promptStyle()` attribute is used to specify whether, when editing a domain object property, the new value for the property is prompted by way of a dialog box, or is prompted using an inline panel (replacing the property on the page).

If the attribute is not set, then the value of the xref:ug:vw:configuration-properties.adoc[configuration property] `isis.viewer.wicket.promptStyle` is used.
If this is itself not set, then an inline prompt is used.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {
    @PropertyLayout(
        promptStyle=PromptStyle.INLINE          // <1>
    )
    public int getNotes(){ ... }
    public void setNotes(String notes) { ... }
}
----
<1> prompt for the new value for the property using an inline panel
Note that the value `INLINE_AS_IF_EDIT` does not make sense for properties; if specified then it will be interpreted as just `INLINE`.

Alternatively, the `promptStyle()` can be specified using xref:ug:vw:layout/file-based.adoc[file-based layouts].
