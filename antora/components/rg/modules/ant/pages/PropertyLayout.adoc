| Attribute
| Values (default)
| Description


|xref:rg:ant:PropertyLayout/cssClass.adoc[`cssClass()`]
|Any string valid as a CSS class

|xref:rg:ant:PropertyLayout/named.adoc[`named()`]

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class ToDoItem {
    @PropertyLayout(
        cssClass="x-key",
        named="Description of this <i>item</i>",
        namedEscaped=false,
        describedAs="What needs to be done",
        labelPosition=LabelPosition.LEFT,
        typicalLength=80
    )
    public String getDescription() { ... }
    ...
}
----

It is also possible to apply the annotation to actions of domain services that are acting as contributed properties.



[TIP]
====
As an alternative to using the `@PropertyLayout` annotation, a xref:ug:vw:layout/file-based.adoc[file-based layout] can be used (and is generally to be preferred since it is more flexible/powerful).
====





[TIP]
====
The annotation is one of a handful (others including xref:rg:ant:Collection.adoc[`@Collection`], xref:rg:ant:CollectionLayout.adoc[`@CollectionLayout`] and xref:rg:ant:Property.adoc[`@Property`]) that can also be applied to the field, rather than the getter method.  This is specifically
so that boilerplate-busting tools such as link:https://projectlombok.org/[Project Lombok] can be used.
