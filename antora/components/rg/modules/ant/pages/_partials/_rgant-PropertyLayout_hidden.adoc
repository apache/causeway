The `hidden()` attribute indicates where (in the UI) the property should be hidden from the user.

[TIP]
====
It is also possible to use xref:rg:ant:rgant.adoc#_rgant-PropertyLayout_hidden[`@PropertyLayout#hidden()`] or a xref:ug:vw:ugvw.adoc#_ugvw_layout_file-based[file-based layout] such that the property can be hidden at the view layer.
Both options are provided with a view that in the future the view-layer semantics may be under the control of (expert) users, whereas domain-layer semantics should never be overridden or modified by the user.
====


For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {
    @PropertyLayout(
        hidden=Where.ALL_TABLES
    )
    public int getInternalId() { ... }
    ...
}
----

The acceptable values for the `where` parameter are:

* `Where.EVERYWHERE` or `Where.ANYWHERE`
+
The property should be hidden everywhere.

* `Where.ANYWHERE`
+
Synonym for everywhere.

* `Where.OBJECT_FORMS`
+
The property should be hidden when displayed within an object form.

* `Where.PARENTED_TABLES`
+
The property should be hidden when displayed as a column of a table within a parent object's collection.

* `Where.STANDALONE_TABLES`
+
The property should be hidden when displayed as a column of a table showing a standalone list of objects, for example as returned by a repository query.

* `Where.ALL_TABLES`
+
The property should be hidden when displayed as a column of a table, either an object's * collection or a standalone list. This combines `PARENTED_TABLES` and `STANDALONE_TABLES`.

* `Where.NOWHERE`
+
The property should not be hidden, overriding any other metadata/conventions that would normally cause the property to be hidden.

For example, if a property is annotated with xref:rg:ant:rgant.adoc#_rgant-Title[`@Title`], then normally this should be hidden from all
tables. Annotating with `@Property(where=Where.NOWHERE)` overrides this.


[NOTE]
====
The xref:ug:vro:ugvro.adoc#[RestfulObjects viewer] has only partial support for these `Where` enums.

== Alternatives

As an alternative to using the annotation, the dynamic xref:ug:vw:ugvw.adoc#_ugvw_layout_file-based[file-based layout] can be used instead.

== See also

This attribute can also be applied to:

* xref:rg:ant:rgant.adoc#_rgant-Action_hidden[actions]
* xref:rg:ant:rgant.adoc#_rgant-Collection_hidden[collections].
