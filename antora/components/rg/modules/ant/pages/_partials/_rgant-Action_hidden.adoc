Actions can be hidden at the domain-level, indicating that they are not visible to the end-user.

[TIP]
====
It is also possible to use xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-ActionLayout_hidden[`@ActionLayout#hidden()`] or xref:../ugvw/ugvw.adoc#_ugvw_layout_file-based[file-based layouts] such that the action can be hidden at the view layer.
Both options are provided with a view that in the future the view-layer semantics may be under the control of (expert) users, whereas domain-layer semantics should never be overridden or modified by the user.
====

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {
    @Action(hidden=Where.EVERYWHERE)
    public void updateStatus() { ... }
    ...
}
----

The acceptable values for the `where` parameter are:

* `Where.EVERYWHERE` or `Where.ANYWHERE` +
+
The action should be hidden at all times.

* `Where.NOWHERE` +
+
The action should not be hidden.


The other values of the `Where` enum have no meaning for a collection.



[NOTE]
====
For actions of domain services the visibility is dependent upon its xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainService_nature[`@DomainService#nature()`] and also on whether it is contributed (as per  xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-ActionLayout_contributedAs[`@ActionLayout#contributedAs()`]).
