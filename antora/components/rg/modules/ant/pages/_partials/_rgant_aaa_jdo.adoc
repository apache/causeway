Apache Isis uses JDO/DataNucleus as its ORM, and infers some of its own metadata from the JDO annotations.

[WARNING]
====
Isis (currently) builds up metadata by parsing the JDO annotations from source, _not_ by querying the JDO metamodel.  The upshot is that, for the annotations documented here at least, your domain entities must use JDO annotations rather than XML.

Furthermore, note that although JDO (the property-related) annotations to be placed on either the field or on the getter, Apache Isis requires that annotations are placed on the getter.
====

The table below lists the JDO annotations currently recognized by Apache Isis.


.JDO Annotations
[cols="2,4a,1,1", options="header"]
|===
|Annotation
|Purpose
|Layer
|Applies to


|xref:rg:ant:rgant.adoc#_rgant-Column[`@javax.jdo.annotations.` +
`Column`]
|Used to determine whether a property is mandatory or optional.  For `String` and `BigDecimal` properties, used to determine length/precision/scale.

|Domain / persistence
|Property


|xref:rg:ant:rgant.adoc#_rgant-Discriminator[`@javax.jdo.annotations.` +
`Discriminator`]
|Override for the object type, as used in `Bookmark`s, URLs for xref:ug:vro:ugvro.adoc#[RestfulObjects viewer] and elsewhere. +

Note that the discriminator overrides the object type that may otherwise be inferred from the xref:rg:ant:rgant.adoc#_rgant-PersistenceCapable[`@PersistenceCapable`] annotation.
|Domain / persistence
|Class


|xref:rg:ant:rgant.adoc#_rgant-NotPersistent[`@javax.jdo.annotations.` +
`NotPersistent`]
|Used to determine whether to enforce or skip some xref:ug:btb:ugbtb.adoc#_ugbtb_programming-model_custom-validator[metamodel validation] for `@Column` versus equivalent Isis annotations.

|Domain / persistence
|Property



|xref:rg:ant:rgant.adoc#_rgant-PersistenceCapable[`@javax.jdo.annotations.` +
`PersistenceCapable`]
|Used to build Apache Isis' own internal identifier for objects. +

If the `schema()` attribute is specified (and if xref:rg:ant:rgant.adoc#\_rgant-Discriminator[`@Discriminator`] __hasn't__ been specified), is also used to derive the object type, as used in `Bookmark`s, URLs for xref:ug:vro:ugvro.adoc#[RestfulObjects viewer] and elsewhere.

|Domain / persistence
|Class


|xref:rg:ant:rgant.adoc#\_rgant-PrimaryKey[`@javax.jdo.annotations.` +
`PrimaryKey`]
|Used to ensure Apache Isis does not overwrite application-defined primary keys, and to ensure is read-only in the UI.

|Domain / persistence
|Property

Isis also parses the following JDO annotations, but the metadata is currently unused.
