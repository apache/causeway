The `sortedBy()` attribute specifies that the collection be ordered using the specified comparator, rather than the natural ordering of the entity (as would usually be the case).

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class ToDoItem implements Comparable<ToDoItem> {      // <1>
    public static class DependenciesComparator               // <2>
            implements Comparator<ToDoItem> {
        @Override
        public int compare(ToDoItem p, ToDoItem q) {
            return ORDERING_BY_DESCRIPTION                   // <3>
                    .compound(Ordering.<ToDoItem>natural())
                    .compare(p, q);
        }
    }
    @CollectionLayout(sortedBy=DependenciesComparator.class) // <4>
    public SortedSet<ToDoItem> getDependencies() { ... }
    ...
}
----
<1> the class has a natural ordering (implementation not shown)
<2> declaration of the comparator class
<3> ordering defined as being by the object's `description` property (not shown), and then by the natural ordering of the class
<4> specify the comparator to use

When the `dependencies` collection is rendered, the elements are sorted by the `description` property first:

[NOTE]
====
Note that this screenshot shows an earlier version of the xref:../ugvw/ugvw.adoc#[Wicket viewer] UI (specifically, pre 1.8.0).

Without this annotation, the order would have been inverted (because the natural ordering places items not completed before those items that have been completed.



== Alternatives

As an alternative to using the annotation, the dynamic xref:../ugvw/ugvw.adoc#_ugvw_layout_file-based[file-based layout] can be used instead.
