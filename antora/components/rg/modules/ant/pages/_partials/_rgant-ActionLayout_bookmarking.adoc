The `bookmarking()` attribute indicates if an action (with safe xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-Action_semantics[action semantics]) is automatically bookmarked.




In the xref:../ugvw/ugvw.adoc#[Wicket viewer], a link to a bookmarked object is shown in the bookmarks panel:

image::{_imagesdir}reference-annotations/ActionLayout/bookmarking.png[width="720px",link="{_imagesdir}reference-annotations/ActionLayout/bookmarking.png"]

[NOTE]
====
Note that this screenshot shows an earlier version of the xref:../ugvw/ugvw.adoc#[Wicket viewer] UI (specifically, pre 1.8.0).
====

[TIP]
====
The xref:../ugvw/ugvw.adoc#[Wicket viewer] supports `alt-[` as a shortcut for opening the bookmark panel.  `Esc` will close.
====


For example:

[source,java]
----
public class ToDoItems {
    @Action(semantics=SemanticsOf.SAFE)
    @ActionLayout(bookmarking=BookmarkPolicy.AS_ROOT)
    @MemberOrder(sequence = "1")
    public List<ToDoItem> notYetComplete() {
        ...
    }
}
----

indicates that the `notYetComplete()` action is bookmarkable.



[NOTE]
====
The enum value `AS_CHILD` has no meaning for actions; it relates only to bookmarked xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainObject_bookmarking[domain object]s.
====


== Alternatives

As an alternative to using the annotation, the dynamic xref:../ugvw/ugvw.adoc#_ugvw_layout_file-based[file-based layout] can be used instead.

This attribute is also supported for xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainObjectLayout_bookmarking[domain objects].
