Whenever a view model is to be rendered, the framework fires off a title UI event to obtain a title for the object.

This attribute is the same as xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant_DomainObjectLayout_titleUiEvent[`@DomainObjectLayout#titleUiEvent()`], but for view models instead of entities.

A default event that is emitted if none specified, unless the `isis.reflector.facet.viewModelLayoutAnnotation.titleUiEvent.postForDefault` configuration property is set to "false".
