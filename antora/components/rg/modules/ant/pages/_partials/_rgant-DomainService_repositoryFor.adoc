The `repositoryFor()` attribute is intended for domain services (probably with a xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainService_nature[`nature=DOMAIN`]) that are intended to act as repositories for domain entities.

For example:

[source,java]
----
@DomainService(
    nature=NatureOfService.DOMAIN,
    repositoryFor=Loan.class
)
public class LoanRepository {
    @Programmatic
    public List<Loan> findLoansFor(Borrower borrower) { ... }
}
----


Currently the metadata is unused; one planned use is to infer the icon for the domain service from the icon of the nominated entity.
