The `describedAs()` attribute is used to provide a short description of the view model to the user; in the xref:../ugvw/ugvw.adoc#[Wicket viewer] it is displayed as a 'tool tip'.

This attribute is the same as xref:rgant.adoc#_rgant_DomainObjectLayout_describedAs[`@DomainObjectLayout#describedAs()`], but for view models instead of entities.
