The `autoCompleteRepository()` attribute nominates a single method on a domain service as the fallback means for looking up instances of the domain object using a simple string.

For example, this might search for a customer by their name or number.
Or it could search for a country based on its ISO-3 code or user-friendly name.


[TIP]
====
If you require additional control - for example restricting the returned results based on the object being interacted with - then use the xref:rg:cms:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_methods_prefixes_autoComplete[`autoComplete...()`] supporting method instead.
====


For example:

[source,java]
----
@DomainObject(
    autoCompleteRepository=CustomerRepository.class
)
public class Customer {
   ....
}
----

where:

[source,java]
----
@DomainService
public class CustomerRepository {
    List<Customer> autoComplete(String search);  // <1>
    ...
}
----
<1> is assumed to be called "autoComplete", and accepts a single string



== `autoCompleteAction()`

As noted above, by default the method invoked on the repository is assumed to be called "autoComplete".  The optional `autoCompleteAction()` attribute allows the method on the repository to be overridden.


For example:

[source,java]
----
@DomainObject(
    autoCompleteRepository=Customers.class,
    autoCompleteAction="findByName"
)
public class Customer {
   ....
}
----

where in this case `findByName` might be an existing action already defined:

[source,java]
----
@DomainService(natureOfService=VIEW_MENU_ONLY)
public class Customers {
    @Action(semantics=SemanticsOf.SAFE)
    public List<Customer> findByName(
        @MinLength(3)                       // <1>
        @ParameterLayout(named="name")
        String name);
    ...
}
----
<1> end-user must enter minimum number of characters to trigger the query

The autocomplete action can also be a regular method, annotated using xref:rg:ant:rgant.adoc#_rgant-Programmatic[`@Programmatic`]:

[source,java]
----
@DomainService(natureOfService=VIEW_MENU_ONLY)
public class Customers {
    @Programmatic
    public List<Customer> findByName(
        @MinLength(3)
        String name);
    ...
}
----


[IMPORTANT]
====
The method specified must be an action, that is, part of the Isis metamodel.
Said another way: it must not be annotated with xref:rg:ant:rgant.adoc#_rgant-Programmatic[`@Programmatic`].
However, it *can* be hidden or placed on a domain service with xref:rg:ant:rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainService_nature[nature] of `DOMAIN`, such that the action would not be rendered otherwise in the UI.
Also, the action cannot be xref:rg:ant:rgant.adoc#_rgant-Action_restrictTo[restricted to] prototyping only.
