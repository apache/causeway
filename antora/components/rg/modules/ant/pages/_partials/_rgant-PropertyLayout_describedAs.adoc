The `describedAs()` attribute is used to provide a short description of the property to the user.  In the xref:ug:vw:ugvw.adoc#[Wicket viewer] it is displayed as a 'tool tip'. The attribute can also be specified for xref:rg:ant:rgant.adoc#_rgant-CollectionLayout_describedAs[collections],  xref:rg:ant:rgant.adoc#_rgant-ActionLayout_describedAs[actions], xref:rg:ant:rgant.adoc#_rgant-ParameterLayout_describedAs[parameters], xref:rg:ant:rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainObjectLayout_describedAs[domain objects] and xref:rg:ant:rgant.adoc#_rgant-ViewModelLayout_describedAs[view models].

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {
    @PropertyLayout(describedAs="The name that the customer has indicated that they wish to be " +
                 "addressed as (e.g. Johnny rather than Jonathan)")
    public String getFirstName() { ... }
}
----


== Alternatives

As an alternative to using the annotation, the dynamic xref:ug:vw:ugvw.adoc#_ugvw_layout_file-based[file-based layout] can be used instead.
