The `navigable()` attribute allows to specify a domain object's (or view's) navigable parent, as utilized by the 'Where am I' feature.

For example:

[source,java]
----
@DomainObject
public class Company { ... }

@DomainObject
public class Employee {

    @Getter @PropertyLayout(navigable=Navigable.PARENT)
    Company myCompany;
}
----

For further details on using a navigable tree-structure, see xref:ug:vw:ugvw.adoc#_ugvw_features_where-am-i[Where am I] in the user guide.
