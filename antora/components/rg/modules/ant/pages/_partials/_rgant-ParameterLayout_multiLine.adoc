The `multiLine()` attribute specifies that the text field for a string parameter should span multiple lines.  It is ignored for other parameter types.  The attribute is also supported for xref:rg:ant:rgant.adoc#_rgant-PropertyLayout_multiLine[properties].

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class BugReport {
    public BugReport updateStepsToReproduce(
                        @Parameter(named="Steps")
                        @ParameterLayout(
                            numberOfLines=10
                        )
                        final String steps) {
        ...
    }
    ...
}
----

[NOTE]
====
If set > 1 (as would normally be the case), then the default xref:rg:ant:rgant.adoc#_rgant-ParameterLayout_labelPosition[`labelPosition`] defaults to `TOP` (rather than `LEFT`, as would normally be the case).
