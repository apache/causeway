The `@ViewModel` annotation, applied to a class, indicates that the class is a view model.
It's a synonym for using `@DomainObject(nature=VIEW_MODEL)`.

View models are not persisted to the database, instead their state is encoded within their identity (ultimately represented in the URL).

For example:

[source,java]
----
@ViewModel
public class CustomerViewModel {
    public CustomerViewModel() {}
    public CustomerViewModel(String firstName, int lastName) {
        this.firstName = firstName;
        this.lastName = lastName;
    }
    ...
}
----

Although there are several ways to instantiate a view model, we recommend that they are instantiated using an N-arg constructor that initializes all relevant state.
The xref:rg:svc:metadata-api/ServiceRegistry.adoc[`ServiceRegistry`] can then be used to inject dependencies into the view model.
For example:

[source,java]
----
Customer cust = ...
CustomerViewModel vm = new CustomerViewModel(cust.getFirstName(),cust.getLastName());
serviceRegistry.injectServicesInto(vm);
----

[TIP]
====
See this xref:ug:btb:hints-and-tips/view-model-instantiation.adoc[tip] for further discussion about instantiating view models.
====

View models must have a no-arg constructor; this is used internally by the framework for subsequent "recreation".

The view model's memento will be derived from the value of the view model object's properties.
Any xref:rg:ant:Property/notPersisted.adoc[`@Property#notPersisted()`] properties will be excluded from the memento, as will any xref:rg:ant:Programmatic.adoc[`@Programmatic`] properties.
Properties that are merely xref:rg:ant:Property/hidden.adoc[hidden] _are_ included in the memento.

Only properties supported by the configured xref:rg:svc:integration-api/MementoService.adoc[`MementoService`] can be used. The default implementation supports all the value types and persisted entities.

View models, as defined by `@ViewModel` (or `@DomainObject(nature=VIEW_MODEL)` for that matter) have some limitations:

* view models cannot hold collections other view models (simple properties _are_ supported, though)
* collections (of either view models or entities) are ignored.
* not every data type is supported,

However, these limitations do _not_ apply to xref:ug:fun:programming-model/view-models/jaxb.adoc[JAXB] view models.
If you are using view models heavily, you may wish to restrict yourself to just the JAXB flavour.


[NOTE]
====
The `@ViewModel` does not allow the objectType to be specified, meaning that it is incompatible with the metamodel validation check ennabled by the xref:rg:cfg:rgcfg.adoc#__rgcfg_configuring-core_metamodel-validation[`explicitObjectType`] configuration property.

Instead, use xref:rg:ant:DomainObject/nature.adoc[`@DomainObject#nature()`] with `Nature.VIEW_MODEL`, and specify xref:rg:ant:DomainObject/objectType.adoc[`@DomainObject#objectType()`].
