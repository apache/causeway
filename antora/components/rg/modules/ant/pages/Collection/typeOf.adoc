The `typeOf()` attribute specifies the expected type of an element contained within a collection when for whatever reason the type cannot be inferred from the generic type, or to provide a hint about the actual run-time (as opposed to compile-time) type.


For example:

[source,java]
----
public void Customer {
    @Collection(typeOf=Order.class)
    public SortedSet getOutstandingOrders() { ... }
    ...
}
----

[TIP]
====
In general we recommend that you use generics instead, eg `SortedSet<Order>`.
