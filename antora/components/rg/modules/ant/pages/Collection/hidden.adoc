Collections can be hidden at the domain-level, indicating that they are not visible to the end-user.


[TIP]
====
It is also possible to use xref:rg:ant:CollectionLayout/hidden.adoc[`@CollectionLayout#hidden()`] or using xref:ug:vw:layout/file-based.adoc[file-based layout] such that the collection can be hidden at the view layer.
Both options are provided with a view that in the future the view-layer semantics may be under the control of (expert) users, whereas domain-layer semantics should never be overridden or modified by the user.
====

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {
    @Collection(where=Where.EVERYWHERE)
    public SortedSet<Address> getAddresses() { ... }
}
----


The acceptable values for the `where` parameter are:

* `Where.EVERYWHERE` or `Where.ANYWHERE` +
+
The collection should be hidden everywhere.

* `Where.ANYWHERE` +
+
Synonym for everywhere.

* `Where.OBJECT_FORMS` +
+
The collection should be hidden when displayed within an object form.

* `Where.NOWHERE` +
+
The collection should not be hidden.

The other values of the `Where` enum have no meaning for a collection.




[NOTE]
====
The xref:ug:vw:ugvw.adoc#[Wicket viewer] suppresses collections when displaying lists of objects.

The xref:ug:vro:about.adoc[RestfulObjects viewer] by default suppress collections when rendering a domain object.
