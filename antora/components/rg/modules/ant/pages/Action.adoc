The `@Action` annotation groups together all domain-specific metadata for an invokable action on a domain object or domain service.

The table below summarizes the annotation's attributes.

.`@Action` attributes
[cols="2,2,4a", options="header"]
|===

| Attribute
| Values (default)
| Description


|xref:rg:ant:Action/associateWith.adoc[`associateWith()`]
|_memberId_ +
("")
|associates an action with another property or collection of the action.

|xref:rg:ant:Action/associateWith.adoc[`associateWith-Sequence()`]
|_memberId_ +
("")
|associates an action with another property or collection of the action.

|xref:rg:ant:Action/command.adoc[`command()`]
|`AS_CONFIGURED`, `ENABLED`, `DISABLED` +
(`AS_CONFIGURED`)
|whether the action invocation should be reified into a `o.a.i.applib.` +
`services.command.Command` object through the xref:rg:svc:application-layer-api/CommandContext.adoc[`CommandContext`] service.


|`commandExecuteIn()`
|`FOREGROUND`,`BACKGROUND` +
(`FOREGROUND`)
|whether to execute the command immediately, or to persist it (assuming that an appropriate implementation of xref:rg:svc:application-layer-spi/CommandService.adoc[`CommandService`] has been configured) such that a background scheduler can execute the command asynchronously


|`commandPersistence()`
|`PERSISTED`, `NOT_PERSISTED`, `IF_HINTED` +
(`PERSISTED`)
|whether the reified `Command` (as provided by the `CommandContext` domain service) should actually be persisted (assuming an appropriate implementation of xref:rg:svc:application-layer-spi/CommandService.adoc[`CommandService`] has been configured).


|`commandDtoProcessor()`
|Implementation of `CommandDtoProcessor` interface +
(null)
|If the `Command` also implements `CommandWithDto` (meaning that it can return a `CommandDto`, in other words be converted into an XML memento), then optionally specifies a processor that can refine this XML.


|xref:rg:ant:Action/domainEvent.adoc[`domainEvent()`]
|subtype of `ActionDomainEvent` +
(`ActionDomainEvent.Default`)
|the event type to be posted to the xref:rg:svc:core-domain-api/EventBusService.adoc[`EventBusService`] to
broadcast the action's business rule checking (hide, disable, validate) and its invocation (pre-execute and
post-execute).


|xref:rg:ant:Action/hidden.adoc[`hidden()`]
|`EVERYWHERE`, `NOWHERE` +
(`NOWHERE`)
|indicates where (in the UI) the action should be hidden from the user.


|xref:rg:ant:Action/invokeOn.adoc[`invokeOn()`]
|`OBJECT_ONLY`, `COLLECTION_ONLY`, `OBJECT_AND_COLLECTION` +
(`OBJECT_ONLY`)
|(deprecated - use view models and associated actions instead).

whether an action can be invoked on a single object and/or on many objects in a collection.

Currently this is only supported for no-arg actions.


|xref:rg:ant:Action/publishing.adoc[`publishing()`]
|`AS_CONFIGURED`, `ENABLED`, `DISABLED` +
(`AS_CONFIGURED`)
|whether the action invocation should be published to the registered xref:rg:svc:persistence-layer-spi/PublisherService.adoc[`PublisherService`].

|xref:rg:ant:Action/restrictTo.adoc[`restrictTo()`]
|`NO_RESTRICTIONS`,`PROTOTYPING` +
(`NO_RESTRICTIONS`)
|whether the action is only available in prototyping mode, or whether it is available also in production mode.

|xref:rg:ant:Action/semantics.adoc[`semantics()`]
|`SAFE_AND_REQUEST_CACHEABLE`, `SAFE`, +
`IDEMPOTENT`, `IDEMPOTENT_ARE_YOU_SURE` +
`NON_IDEMPOTENT`, `NON_IDEMPOTENT_ARE_YOU_SURE` + +
(`NON_IDEMPOTENT`)
|the action's semantics (ie whether objects are modified as the result of invoking this action, and if so whether reinvoking the action would result in no further change; if not whether the results can be cached for the remainder of the request).

The `...ARE_YOU_SURE` variants cause a confirmation dialog to be displayed in the xref:ug:vw:ugvw.adoc#[Wicket viewer].

|xref:rg:ant:Action/typeOf.adoc[`typeOf()`]
|(none)
|if the action returns a collection, hints as to the run-time type of the objects within that collection (as a fallback)

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class ToDoItem {
    public static class CompletedEvent extends ActionDomainEvent<ToDoItem> { }
    @Action(
        command=CommandReification.ENABLED,
        commandExecuteIn=CommandExecuteIn.FOREGROUND,          // <1>
        commandPersistence=CommandPersistence.NOT_PERSISTED,   // <2>
        domainEvent=CompletedEvent.class,
        hidden = Where.NOWHERE,                                // <3>
        invokeOn = InvokeOn.OBJECT_ONLY,                       // <4>
        publishing = Publishing.ENABLED,
        semantics = SemanticsOf.IDEMPOTENT
    )
    public ToDoItem completed() { ... }
