The `cssClass()` attribute can be used to render additional CSS classes in the HTML (a wrapping `<div>`) that represents the action parameter.   xref:rg:cfg:application-specific/application-css.adoc[Application-specific CSS] can then be used to target and adjust the UI representation of that particular element.


For example:

[source,java]
----
public class ToDoItem {
    public ToDoItem postpone(
            @ParameterLayout(
                named="until",
                cssClass="x-key"
            )
            LocalDate until
        ) { /* ... */ }
    ...
}
----
