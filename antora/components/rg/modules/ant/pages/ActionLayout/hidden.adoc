The `hidden()` attribute indicates where (in the UI) the action should be hidden from the user.


[TIP]
====
It is also possible to use xref:rg:ant:Action/hidden.adoc[`@Action#hidden()`] to hide an action at the domain layer.
Both options are provided with a view that in the future the view-layer semantics may be under the control of (expert) users, whereas domain-layer semantics should never be overridden or modified by the user.
====

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {
    @ActionLayout(hidden=Where.EVERYWHERE)
    public void updateStatus() { ... }
    ...
}
----

The acceptable values for the `where` parameter are:

* `Where.EVERYWHERE` or `Where.ANYWHERE` +
+
The action should be hidden at all times.

* `Where.NOWHERE` +
+
The action should not be hidden.


The other values of the `Where` enum have no meaning for a collection.


[NOTE]
====
For actions of domain services the visibility is dependent upon its xref:rg:ant:DomainService/nature.adoc[`@DomainService#nature()`] and also on whether it is contributed (as per  xref:rg:ant:ActionLayout/contributedAs.adoc[`@ActionLayout#contributedAs()`]).
====


== Alternatives

As an alternative to using the annotation, the dynamic xref:ug:vw:layout/file-based.adoc[file-based layout] can be used instead.






== See also

This attribute can also be applied to:
* xref:rg:ant:PropertyLayout/hidden.adoc[properties]
* xref:rg:ant:CollectionLayout/hidden.adoc[collections].
