The `paged()` attribute specifies the number of rows to display in a (parented) collection.



[WARNING]
====
The xref:ug:vro:about.adoc[RestfulObjects viewer] currently does not support paging.
The xref:ug:vw:ugvw.adoc#[Wicket viewer] _does_ support paging, but note that the paging is performed client-side rather than server-side.

We therefore recommend that large collections should instead be modelled as actions (to allow filtering to be applied to limit the number of rows).
====


For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Order {
    @CollectionLayout(paged=15)
    public SortedSet<OrderLine> getDetails() {...}
}
----


It is also possible to specify a global default for the page size of standalone collections, using the xref:rg:cfg:configuring-core.adoc[configuration property] `isis.viewer.paged.parented`.



== Alternatives

As an alternative to using the annotation, the dynamic xref:ug:vw:layout/file-based.adoc[file-based layout] can be used instead.


== See also

This attribute can also be applied to:

* xref:rg:ant:DomainObjectLayout/paged.adoc[domain objects]
* xref:rg:ant:ViewModelLayout/paged.adoc[view models].
