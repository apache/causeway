The `describedAs()` attribute is used to provide a short description of the collection to the user.  In the xref:ug:vw:about.adoc[Wicket viewer] it is displayed as a 'tool tip'.

The `describedAs()` attribute can also be specified for xref:rg:ant:PropertyLayout/describedAs.adoc[properties], xref:rg:ant:ActionLayout/describedAs.adoc[actions], xref:rg:ant:ParameterLayout/describedAs.adoc[parameters], xref:rg:ant:DomainObjectLayout/describedAs.adoc[domain objects] and xref:rg:ant:ViewModelLayout/describedAs.adoc[view models].


For example:

[source,java]
----
public class ToDoItem {
    @CollectionLayout(
        describedAs="Other todo items that must be completed before this one"
    )
    public SortedSet<ToDoItem> getDependencies() { /* ... */ }
    ...
}
----


== Alternatives


As an alternative to using the annotation, the dynamic xref:ug:vw:layout/file-based.adoc[file-based layout] can be used instead.
