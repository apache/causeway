The `CommandDtoServiceInternal` is responsible for creating an memento of the current action
invocation or property edit, to store in the `Command` object (from
xref:rg:svc:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_application-layer-api_CommandContext[`CommandContext`]).  This memento is a JAXB DTO being an instance of the
xref:rg:cms:schema/cmd.adoc["cmd" schema], so can be reified so that its execution can be deferred until later,
as a xref:rg:svc:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_application-layer-spi_BackgroundCommandService[background command].



== SPI & Implementation

The SPI of the service is:

[source,java]
----
public interface CommandDtoServiceInternal {
    CommandDto asCommandDto(                                // <1>
            List<ObjectAdapter> targetAdapters,
            ObjectAction objectAction,
            ObjectAdapter[] argAdapters);
    CommandDto asCommandDto(                                // <2>
            final List<ObjectAdapter> targetAdapters,
            final OneToOneAssociation association,
            final ObjectAdapter valueAdapterOrNull);
    void addActionArgs(                                     // <3>
            final ObjectAction objectAction,
            final ActionDto actionDto,
            final ObjectAdapter[] argAdapters);
    void addPropertyValue(                                  // <4>
            final OneToOneAssociation property,
            final PropertyDto propertyDto,
            final ObjectAdapter valueAdapter);
}
----
<1> Returns a JAXB DTO being an instance of the xref:rg:cms:schema/cmd.adoc["cmd" schema] (hence convertible to
XML) that represents the __intention__ to invoke an action on a target object (or possibly many targets, for
bulk actions).  If an action, it can also be either mixin action or a contributed action.
<2> Returns a JAXB DTO that represents the intention to edit (set or clear) a property on a target (or possibly many
targets, for symmetry with actions).
<3> add the arguments of an action to an `ActionDto`.  This is used when the command is actually executed (per xref:rg:svc:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_application-layer-api_InteractionContext[`InteractionContext`]) to populate the parameters of the equivalent `ActionInvocationDto`.
<4> add the new value argument of a property to a `PropertyDto`.  This is used when the command is actually executed (per xref:rg:svc:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_application-layer-api_InteractionContext[`InteractionContext`]) to set the the new value of the equivalent `PropertyEditDto`.


The SPI is implemented by `o.a.i.c.r.s.command.CommandDtoServiceInternalServiceDefault`.


== Related Services

The design of this service is similar to that of
xref:rg:fis:application-layer/InteractionDtoServiceInternal.adoc[`InteractionDtoServiceInternal`], used to create the
`MemberExecutionDto` (from the xref:rg:cms:schema/ixn.adoc["ixn" schema]).
