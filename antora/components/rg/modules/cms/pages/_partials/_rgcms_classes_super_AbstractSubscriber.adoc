This is a convenience superclass for creating subscriber domain services on the xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_core-domain-api_EventBusService[`EventBusService`].
It uses xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-PostConstruct[`@PostConstruct`] and xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-PreDestroy[`@PreDestroy`] callbacks to automatically register/unregister itself with the `EventBusService`.

It's important that subscribers register before any domain services that might emit events on the xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_core-domain-api_EventBusService[`EventBusService`].
For example, the (non-ASF) link:http://platform.incode.org[Incode Platform^] security module provides a domain service that automatically seeds certain domain entities; these will generate xref:../rgcms/rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_lifecycleevent[lifecycle events] and so any subscribers must be registered before such seed services.
The easiest way to do this is to use the xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainServiceLayout_menuOrder[`@DomainServiceLayout#menuOrder()`] attribute.

As a convenience, the `AbstractSubscriber` specifies this attribute.
