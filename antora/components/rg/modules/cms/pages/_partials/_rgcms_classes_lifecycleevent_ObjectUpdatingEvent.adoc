Subclass of xref:../rgcms/rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_lifecycleevent_AbstractLifecycleEvent[`AbstractLifecycleEvent`], broadcast when an object is about to be updated in the database.
This is done either explicitly when the current transaction is flushed using the xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_core-domain-api_RepositoryService[`RepositoryService`]'s `#flush(...)` method, else is done implicitly when the transaction commits at the end of the user request.


`ObjectUpdatingEvent.Default` is the implementation that is used by default, but this can be overridden using xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant_DomainObject_updatingLifecycleEvent[`@DomainObject#updatingLifecycleEvent()`].
