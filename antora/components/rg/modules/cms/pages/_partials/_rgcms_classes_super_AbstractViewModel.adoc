This class simply implements the xref:rg:cms:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_super_ViewModel[`ViewModel`] interface, however the methods are still abstract.
In and of itself it provides no new behaviour.

[TIP]
====
As an alternative, consider simply annotating the view model class with the {@link org.apache.isis.applib.annotation.ViewModel} annotation.
