The lifecycle callback methods notify a domain entity about its interaction within the persistence lifecycle.
For example, the entity is notified immediately prior to being persisted, or when it is about to be updated.

[WARNING]
====
Note that these callbacks are fired by Apache Isis rather than JDO.
In the future we may deprecate them because there are better mechanisms available using a subscriber for the xref:../rgcms/rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_lifecycleevent[lifecycle event]s.

The lifecycle callback methods supported by Apache Isis are:
