Subclass of xref:rg:cms:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_lifecycleevent_AbstractLifecycleEvent[`AbstractLifecycleEvent`], broadcast when an object is about to be saved (inserted) into the database using the xref:rg:svc:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_core-domain-api_RepositoryService[`RepositoryService`]'s `#persist(...)` method.


`ObjectPersistingEvent.Default` is the implementation that is used by default, but this can be overridden using xref:rg:ant:rgant.adoc#_rgant_DomainObject_persistingLifecycleEvent[`@DomainObject#persistingLifecycleEvent()`].
