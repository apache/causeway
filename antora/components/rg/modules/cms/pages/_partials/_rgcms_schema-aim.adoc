The "aim" schema previously defined the serialized form (or memento) of an action invocation.

The schema was removed in `1.13.0`, and was replaced by:

* xref:../rgcms/rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_schema-ixn[ixn.xsd]

+
for action invocations/property edits, and

* xref:../rgcms/rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_schema-cmd[cmd.xsd]

+
for commands, ie the __intention__ to invoke an action/edit a property.
