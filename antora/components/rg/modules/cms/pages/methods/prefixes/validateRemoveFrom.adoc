The `validateRemoveFrom...()` supporting method is called whenever an object is to be removed from a collection. Its purpose is to validate the proposed object removal and possibly veto the change.


[NOTE]
====
Directly mutable collections are not currently supported by the xref:ug:vw:about.adoc[Wicket viewer].
The suggested workaround is to simply define an action.
====


The signature of the supporting method for a collection with element type `E` is:

[source,java]
----
public String validateRemoveFromXxx(E element) { ... }
----

where the returned string is the reason the collection modification invocation is vetoed (or `null` if not vetoed).  Apache Isis' xref:ug:btb:i18n.adoc[i18n support] extends this so that reasons can be internationalized if required.


For example:

[source,java]
----
public class LibraryMember {
    public SortedSet<Book> getBorrowed() { ... }
    public void setBorrowed(SortedSet<Book> borrowed) { ... }
    public String validateAddToBorrowed(Book book) { ... }
    public void validateRemoveFromBorrowed(Book book) {
        return !book.hasBeenReadBy(this)? "You didn't read this book yet": null;
    }
    ...
}
----
