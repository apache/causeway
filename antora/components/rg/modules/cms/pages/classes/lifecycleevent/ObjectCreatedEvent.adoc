Subclass of xref:rg:cms:classes/lifecycleevent/AbstractLifecycleEvent.adoc[`AbstractLifecycleEvent`], broadcast when an object is first instantiated using the xref:rg:svc:core-domain-api/FactoryService.adoc[`FactoryServuce`]'s `#instantiate(...)` method.

`ObjectCreatedEvent.Default` is the implementation that is used by default, but this can be overridden using xref:rg:ant:DomainObject/createdLifecycleEvent.adoc[`@DomainObject#createdLifecycleEvent()`].
