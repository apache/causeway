This event class represents a request to obtain the title of a domain object.  The class has a number of responsibilities:

* capture the target object being interacted with

* capture the title, if any, as specified to one of the subscribers

The class itself is instantiated automatically by the framework whenever interacting with a rendered object's action.


[NOTE]
====
If the domain object defines its own xref:rg:cms:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_methods_reserved_title[`title()`] supporting method, or
has xref:rg:ant:Title.adoc[`@Title`] annotation(s) on its properties, then these will take
precedence.
