The `RoutingService` provides the ability to return (and therefore render) an alternative object from an action invocation.

There are two primary use cases:

* if an action returns an aggregate leaf (that is, a child object which has an owning parent), then the parent object can be
returned instead. +
+
For example, an action returning `OrderItem` might instead render the owning `Order` object.  It is the responsibility
of the implementation to figure out what the "owning" object might be.

* if an action returns `null` or is `void`, then return some other "useful" object. +
+
For example, return the home page (eg as defined by the xref:rg:ant:rgant.adoc#_rgant-HomePage[`@HomePage`] annotation).

Currently the routing service is used only by the xref:ug:vw:ugvw.adoc#[Wicket viewer]; it is ignored by the xref:ug:vro:ugvro.adoc#[Restful Objects] viewer.


[NOTE]
====
Unlike most other domain services, the framework will check _all_ available implementations of
`RoutingService` to return a route, rather than the first implementation found; in other words it uses the
chain-of-responsibility pattern.  Services are called in the order defined by
xref:rg:ant:rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainServiceLayout_menuOrder[`@DomainServiceLayout#menuOrder()`]).  The route used will be the
result of the first implementation checked that declares that it can provide a route.

== SPI

The SPI defined by this service is:

[source,java]
----
public interface RoutingService {
    @Programmatic
    boolean canRoute(Object original);  // <1>
    @Programmatic
    Object route(Object original);      // <2>
}
----
<1> whether this implementation recognizes and can "route" the object.  The `route(...)` method is only called if this method returns `true`.
<2> the object to use; this may be the same as the original object, some other object, or (indeed) `null`.




== Implementation

The framework provides a default implementation - `RoutingServiceDefault` - which will always return the original object provided, or the home page if a `null` or `void` was provided.
It uses the xref:rg:svc:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_application-layer-spi_HomePageProviderService[`HomePageProviderService`].

There can be multiple implementations of `RoutingService` registered.
These are checked in turn (chain of responsibility pattern), ordered according to xref:rg:ant:rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainServiceLayout_menuOrder[`@DomainServiceLayout#menuOrder()`] (as explained in the xref:rg:svc:rgsvc.adoc#__rgsvc_intro_overriding-the-services[introduction] to this guide).
The route from the first service that returns `true` from its `canRoute(...)` method will be used.
