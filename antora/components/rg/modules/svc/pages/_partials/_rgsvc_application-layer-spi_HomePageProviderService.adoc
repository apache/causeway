This service simply provides access to the home page object (if any) that is returned from the domain service action annotated with xref:rg:ant:rgant.adoc#_rgant-HomePage[`@HomePage`].

It was originally introduced to support the default implementation of xref:rg:svc:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_presentation-layer-spi_RoutingService[`RoutingService`], but was factored out to support alternative implementations of that service (and may be useful for other use cases).


== SPI & Implementation

The SPI defined by `HomePageProviderService` is:

[source,java]
----
public interface HomePageProviderService {
    @Programmatic
    Object homePage();
}
----

The default implementation is provided by `o.a.i.core.runtime.services.homepage.HomePageProviderServiceDefault`.

Any custom implementations should be annotated using `@DomainService(nature = NatureOfService.DOMAIN)`.
