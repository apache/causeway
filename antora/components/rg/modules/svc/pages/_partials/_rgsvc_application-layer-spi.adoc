Domain service SPIs influence how the framework handles application layer concerns, for example which home page to render to the end-user.


The table below summarizes the application layer SPIs defined by Apache Isis.
It also lists their corresponding implementation, either a default implementation provided by Apache Isis itself, or provided by one of the (non-ASF) link:http://platform.incode.org[Incode Platform^] modules.
