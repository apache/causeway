The `UserProfileService` provides the ability for the domain application to return supplementary metadata about the current user. This information is used (by the xref:../ugvw/ugvw.adoc#[Wicket viewer]) to customize the appearance of the tertiary "Me" menu bar (top right). For example, rather than display the username, instead the user's first and last name could be displayed.

Another use case is to allow the user to switch context in some fashion or other. This might be to emulate a sort of "sudo"-like function, or perhaps to focus on some particular set of data.



== SPI

The SPI defined by the service is:

[source,java]
----
public interface UserProfileService {
    @Programmatic
    String userProfileName();       // <1>
}
----
<1> is used (in the Wicket viewer) as the menu name of the tertiary "Me" menu bar.

If the method returns `null` or throws an exception then the framework will default to using the current user name.

In the future this API may be expanded; one obvious possibility is to return a profile photo or avatar URL.



== Implementation

The framework provides a default implementation of this service, `o.a.i.core.runtime.services.UserProfileServiceDefault`.
This simply returns the user's name as the user's profile name.

An example implementation can also be found in the (non-ASF)
