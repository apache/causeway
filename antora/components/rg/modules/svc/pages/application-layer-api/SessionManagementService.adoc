The `SessionManagementService` provides the ability to programmatically manage sessions.  The primary use case is
for fixture scripts or other routines that are invoked from the UI and which create or modify large amounts of data.
A classic example is migrating data from one system to another.



== API

The API of `SessionManagementService` is:


[source,java]
----
public interface SessionManagementService {
    void nextSession();
}
----


Normally, the framework will automatically start a session and then a transaction before each user interaction
(action invocation or property modification), and wil then commit that transaction and close the session after the
interaction has completed.  If the interaction throws an exception then the transaction is aborted.

The `nextSession()` method allows a domain object to commit the transaction, close the session, then open a new
session and start a new transaction.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Any domain objects that were created in the "previous" session are no longer usable, and must not be rendered in the UI.
====



== Implementation

The core framework provides a default implementation of this service (`o.a.i.core.runtime.services.xactn.SessionManagementServiceDefault`).


To use an alternative implementation, implement the `SessionManagementService` interface and use xref:rg:ant:DomainServiceLayout/menuOrder.adoc[`@DomainServiceLayout#menuOrder()`] (as explained in the xref:rg:svc:intro/overriding-the-services.adoc[introduction] to this guide).
