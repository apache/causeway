The `EmailService` provides the ability to send HTML emails, with attachments, to one or more recipients.

Apache Isis provides a default implementation to send emails using an external SMTP provider.
Note that this must be configured (using a number of configuration properties) before it can be used.
The that sends email as an HTML message, using an external SMTP provider.



== API

The API for the service is:

[source,java]
----
public interface EmailService {
    boolean send(                                                   // <1>
        List<String> to, List<String> cc, List<String> bcc,         // <2>
        String subject,
        String body,                                                // <3>
        DataSource... attachments);
    boolean isConfigured();                                         // <4>
}
----
<1> is the main API to send the email (and optional attachments).
Will return `false` if failed to send
<2> pass either `null` or `Collections.emptyList()` if not required
<3> should be HTML text
<4> indicates whether the implementation was configured and initialized correctly.
If this returns `false` then any attempt to call `send(...)` will fail.


== Implementation

As noted in the introduction, the core framework provides a default implementation, `EmailServiceDefault`.
This sends email as an HTML message, using an external SMTP provider.


=== Configuration Properties

The default implementation defines the following configuration properties:

[cols="2a,1,3a", options="header"]
|===
|Property
|Value +
(default value)
|Description

| `isis.service.` +
`email.` +
`override.bcc` +
| email address
|intended to simplify testing, if specified then the email's `bcc` address will be that specified (rather than the email address(es) passed in as an argument to `EmailService#send(...)`).  +

NB: note that the key is mis-spelt, (`isis.service.email` rather than `isis.services.email`)


| `isis.service.` +
`email.` +

NB: note that the key is mis-spelt, (`isis.service.email` rather than `isis.services.email`)


| `isis.service.` +
`email.` +
`override.to` +
| email address
|intended to simplify testing, if specified then the email's `to` address will be that specified (rather than the email address(es) passed in as an argument to `EmailService#send(...)`).  +

NB: note that the key is mis-spelt, (`isis.service.email` rather than `isis.services.email`)

`email.` +
`port` +
| port number (`_587_`)
|The port number for the SMTP service on the the external SMTP host (used by xref:rg:svc:integration-api/EmailService.adoc[`EmailService`]).  +

NB: note that the key is mis-spelt, (`isis.service.email` rather than `isis.services.email`)


| `isis.service.` +
`email.` +
`sender.address` +
| email address
|The email address to use for sending out email (used by xref:rg:svc:integration-api/EmailService.adoc[`EmailService`]).
*Mandatory*.  +

NB: note that the key is mis-spelt, (`isis.service.email` rather than `isis.services.email`)


| `isis.service.` +
`email.` +
`sender.hostname` +
| host (`_smtp.gmail.com_`)
|The hostname of the external SMTP provider (used by xref:rg:svc:integration-api/EmailService.adoc[`EmailService`]).  +

NB: note that the key is mis-spelt, (`isis.service.email` rather than `isis.services.email`)


| `isis.service.` +
`email.` +
`sender.password` +
| email password
|The corresponding password for the email address to use for sending out email (used by xref:rg:svc:integration-api/EmailService.adoc[`EmailService`]).
*Mandatory*.  +

NB: note that the key is mis-spelt, (`isis.service.email` rather than `isis.services.email`)


| `isis.service.` +
`email.` +
`socket` +
`ConnectionTimeout`
|milliseconds +
(2000)
|The socket connection timeout

NB: note that the key is mis-spelt, (`isis.service.email` rather than `isis.services.email`)


| `isis.service.` +
`email.` +
`socketTimeout`
|milliseconds +
(2000)
|The socket timeout

NB: note that the key is mis-spelt, (`isis.service.email` rather than `isis.services.email`)



| `isis.service.` +
`email.` +
`throwExceptionOnFail`
|`true`,`false` +
(`true`)
|Whether to throw an exception if there the email cannot be sent (probably because of some misconfiguration).

This behaviour is (now) the default; the old behaviour (of just returning `false` from the `send()` method) can be re-enabled by setting this property to `false`.

NB: note that the key is mis-spelt, (`isis.service.email` rather than `isis.services.email`)


| `isis.service.` +
`email.` +
`tls.enabled`
|`true`,`false` +
(`true`)
|Whether to enable TLS for the email SMTP connection (used by xref:rg:svc:integration-api/EmailService.adoc[`EmailService`]).  +

NB: note that the key is mis-spelt, (`isis.service.email` rather than `isis.services.email`)

|===


Thus, use this service the following properties must be configured:

* `isis.service.email.sender.address`
* `isis.service.email.sender.password`

and these properties may optionally be configured (each has a default to use gmail, documented xref:rg:cfg:configuring-core.adoc[here]):

* `isis.service.email.sender.hostname`
* `isis.service.email.port`
* `isis.service.email.tls.enabled`

These configuration properties can be specified either in `isis.properties` or in an xref:ug:btb:deployment/externalized-configuration.adoc[external configuration file], or programmatically using the xref:rg:cms:classes/AppManifest-bootstrapping.adoc[`AppManifest`].

// TODO: v2: confirm this is the case.

Configuration properties can also be specified as system properties.
For example, if you create a test email account on gmail, you can configure the service using:

[source,ini]
----
-Disis.service.email.sender.address=xxx@gmail.com -Disis.service.email.sender.password=yyy
----

where "xxx" is the gmail user account and "yyy" is its password


In addition the following properties can be set:

* `isis.service.email.sender.username` +
+
Rather than authenticate using the sender address, instead use the specified username.

* `isis.service.email.throwExceptionOnFail` +
+
Whether to throw an exception if there the email cannot be sent (probably because of some misconfiguration).
This behaviour is (now) the default; the old behaviour (of just returning `false` from the `send()` method) can be re-enabled by setting this property to `false`.

* `isis.service.email.override.to` +
+
Intended to simplify testing, if specified then the email's `to` address will be that specified (rather than the email address(es) passed in as an argument to `EmailService#send(...)`).

* `isis.service.email.override.cc` +
+
Similarly, to override the `cc` email address.

* `isis.service.email.override.to` +
+
Similarly, to override the `bcc` email address.

* `isis.service.email.socketTimeout` +
+
The socket timeout, defaulting to 2000ms.

* `isis.service.email.socketConnectionTimeout` +
+
The socket connection timeout, defaulting to 2000ms.


== Alternative Implementations

If you wish to write an alternative implementation, be aware that it should process the message body as HTML (as opposed to plain text or any other format).

Also, note that (unlike most Apache Isis domain services) the implementation is also instantiated and injected by Google Guice.
This is because `EmailService` is used as part of the xref:ug:vw:features/user-registration.adoc[user registration] functionality and is used by Wicket pages that are accessed outside of the usual Apache Isis runtime.
This implies a couple of additional constraints:

* first, implementation class should also be annotated with `@com.google.inject.Singleton`
* second, there may not be any Apache Isis session running.
(If necessary, one can be created on the fly using `IsisContext.doInSession(...)`)

To ensure that your alternative implementation takes the place of the default implementation, register it explicitly in `isis.properties`.
