This chapter describes the commands often used while working with git.
In addition to these basic commands, please make sure you have read:

* xref:conguide:ROOT:building-apache-isis.adoc[building Apache Isis]
* xref:conguide:ROOT:contributing.adoc[Contributing]
* xref:comguide:ROOT:policies/git-policy.adoc[Git policy]

== Modifying existing files

To modify existing files:

[source,bash]
----
git add filename
git commit -m "ISIS-nnn: yada yada"
----

The `git add` command adds the changes to the file(s) to the git index (aka staging area).
If you were to make subsequent changes to the file these would not be committed.

The `git commit` takes all the staged changes and commits them locally.
Note that these changes are not shared public with Apache Isis' central git repo.

You can combine these two commands using `-am` flag to git commit:

[source,bash]
----
git commit -am "ISIS-nnn: yada yada"
----

== Adding new files

To add a new file:

[source,bash]
----
git add .
git commit -m "ISIS-nnn: yada yada"
----

Note that this sequence of commands is identical to modifying an existing file.
However, it isn't possible to combine the two steps using `git commit -am`; the `git add` is always needed when adding new files to the repo.

== Deleting files

To delete a file:

[source,bash]
----
git rm filename
git commit -m "ISIS-nnn: yada yada"
----

== Renaming or moving files

To rename or move a file:

[source,bash,subs=+quotes]
----
git mv _filename_ _newfilename_
git commit -m "ISIS-nnn: yada yada"
----

== Common Workflows

The xref:conguide:ROOT:contributing.adoc[contributing] page describes the workflow for non-committers.
The xref:comguide:ROOT:policies/git-policy.adoc[Git policy] page describes a workflow for Apache Isis **committers**.

== Backing up a local branch

If committing to a local branch, the changes are still just that: local, and run risk of a disk failure or other disaster.

To create a new, similarly named branch on the central repo, use:

[source,bash,subs=+quotes]
----
git push -u origin _branchname_
----

Using `gitk --all` will show you this new branch, named *origin/branchname*.

Thereafter, you can push subsequent commits using simply:

[source,bash]
----
git push
----

Doing this also allows others to collaborate on this branch, just as they would for `master`.

When, eventually, you have reintegrated this branch, you can delete the remote branch using:

[source,bash,subs=+quotes]
----
git push origin --delete _branchname_
----

For more detail, see this link:http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2003505/how-do-i-delete-a-git-branch-both-locally-and-in-github[stackoverflow post].

== Quick change: stashing changes

If you are working on something but are not ready to commit, then use:

[source,bash]
----
git stash
----

If you use `gitk --all` then you'll see new commits are made that hold the current state of your working directory and staging area.

You can then, for example, pull down the latest changes using `git pull --rebase` (see above).

To reapply your stash, then use:

[source,bash]
----
git stash pop
----

Note that stashing works even if switching branches

== Ignoring files

Put file patterns into `.gitignore`.
There is one at the root of the git repo, but they can additionally appear in subdirectories (the results are cumulative).

- link:http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gitignore.html[man page]

== More advanced use cases

=== If accidentally push to remote

Suppose you committed to `master`, and then pushed the change, and then decided that you didn't intend to do that:

[source,bash]
----
C1  -  C2  -  C3  -  C4  -  C5  -  C6  -  C7
                                          ^
                                          master
                                          ^
                                          origin/master
----

To go back to an earlier commit, first we wind back the local `master`:

[source,bash]
----
git reset --hard C5
----

where `C5` is the long sha-id for that commit.

This gets us to:

[source,bash]
----
C1  -  C2  -  C3  -  C4  -  C5  -  C6  -  C7
                            ^
                            master
                                          ^
                                          origin/master
----

Then, do a force push:

[source,bash]
----
git push origin master --force
----

If this doesn't work, it may be that the remote repo has disabled this feature.
There are other hacks to get around this, see for example link:http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1377845/git-reset-hard-and-a-remote-repository[here].

== If you've accidentally worked on `master` branch

If at any time the `git pull` from your upstream fails, it most likely means that you must have made commits on the `master` branch.
You can use `gitk --all` to confirm; at some point in time both `master` and `origin\master` will have a common ancestor.

You can retrospectively create a topic branch for the work you've accidentally done on `master`.

First, create a branch for your current commit:

[source,bash,subs=+quotes]
----
git branch _newbranch_
----

Next, make sure you have no outstanding edits.
If you do, you should commit them or stash them:

[source,bash]
----
git stash
----

Finally, locate the shaId of the commit you want to roll back to (easily obtained in `gitk -all`), and wind `master` branch back to that commit:

[source,bash,subs=+quotes]
----
git checkout master
git reset --hard _shaId_ <1>
----
<1> move master branch shaId of common ancestor
