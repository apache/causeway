The `tooling` modules provides a set of utilities and generators that are used to reduce the maintenance cost of documentation and the link:https://github.com/apache/causeway-app-referenceapp[reference app].
None of these modules are formally released as part of the framework.

Broadly speaking there are two main sets of tools:

* the `causeway-tooling-cli` module (in `tooling/cli`) creates a CLI jar file (`causeway-tooling-cli.jar`) that is used to generate two different sets of documentation for the website:

** under `antora/components/refguide-index`
+
are the index pages.
Typically API classes are included in the index, and this is done by simply including:
+
[source]
----
@since {@index}
----
+
within their javadoc.
Learn more about how to reference these generated pages in our internal xref:core::about.adoc#generated-index[design docs].

** under `core/adoc`
+
is an overview of all of the modules that make up the framework.
This can be found at xref:core:_overview:about.adoc[].

+
For more on the CLI, see xref:tooling:tooling-cli:about.adoc[tooling CLI] docs.
You could also inspect the `preview.sh` script (and the various scripts it calls in turn) to see how we use the CLI in practice.

* the `causeway-toolikng-metaprog` module (in tooling/metaprog`) contains a set of test classes that are used to generate classes and files for the various datatypes showcased in the link:https://github.com/apache/causeway-app-referenceapp[reference app].
+
To use, locate the `ValueTypeGenTemplateTest` class.
