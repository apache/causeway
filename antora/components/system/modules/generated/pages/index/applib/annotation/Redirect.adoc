As defined by configuration property `isis.viewer.wicket.redirectEvenIfSameObject` 

[#EVEN_IF_SAME]
=== EVEN_IF_SAME

Redirect (meaning render a new page) even if the result of the action is the same as the target.

[#ONLY_IF_DIFFERS]
=== ONLY_IF_DIFFERS

Don't redirect if the result is the same as the target, instead just update the existing page.

Of course, a redirect is still performed if the result of the action is different from the target.
