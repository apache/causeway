Indicates that an object belongs to the UI/application layer, and is intended to be used as a view model.

Objects that are part of the domain object layer should instead implement xref:applib/RecreatableDomainObject[RecreatableDomainObject] .

interface ViewModel {

  String viewModelMemento() // <.>

  void viewModelInit(String memento) // <.>

<.> `[teal]#*viewModelMemento*#()` : `String`

--
Obtain a memento of the view model.

Typically this will be the identifier of a backing domain entity, but it could also be an arbitrary string, for example a bunch of JSON.

This method is called by the framework in order that the view model may be recreated subsequently through _#viewModelInit(String)_ .

<.> `[teal]#*viewModelInit*#(String memento)` : `void`
+
--
Used to re-initialize a view model with a memento obtained from _#viewModelMemento()_ .
