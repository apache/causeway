This service allows an XML document to be generated capturing the data of a root entity and specified related entities. This XML can be used for various purposes, such as mail merge/reporting, or adhoc auditing.

The framework provides an implementation of this service ( `XmlSnapshotServiceDefault` ) which is automatically registered and available for use; no further configuration is required.
