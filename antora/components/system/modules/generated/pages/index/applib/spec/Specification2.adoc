Optional extension to the base xref:system:generated:index/applib/spec/Specification.adoc.adoc[Specification] , to allow for i18n.

If implemented, then the _#satisfies(Object)_ inherited from xref:system:generated:index/applib/spec/Specification.adoc.adoc[Specification] can just return `null` ; it will never be called by the framework.

If `null` then satisfied, otherwise is the reason (as a xref:system:generated:index/applib/services/i18n/TranslatableString.adoc.adoc[TranslatableString] translatable string) as to why the specification is not satisfied.
