This service provides a formal API into Isis' metamodel.

This API is currently extremely limited, but the intention is to extend it gradually as use cases emerge.

Provides a lookup of a domain class' object type, as defined by _DomainObject#objectType()_ (or any other mechanism that corresponds to Isis' `ObjectSpecIdFacet` ).

== Members

[#fromObjectType]
=== fromObjectType

Provides a reverse lookup of a domain class' object type, as defined by _DomainObject#objectType()_ (or any other mechanism that corresponds to Isis' `ObjectSpecIdFacet` ).

[#toObjectType]
=== toObjectType

Provides a lookup of a domain class' object type, as defined by _DomainObject#objectType()_ (or any other mechanism that corresponds to Isis' `ObjectSpecIdFacet` ).

[#getDomainModel]
=== getDomainModel

Returns a list of representations of each of member of each domain class.

Used by xref:system:generated:index/applib/services/metamodel/MetaModelServiceMenu.adoc[MetaModelServiceMenu] to return a downloadable CSV.

Note that _MetaModelService#exportMetaModel(Config)_ provides a superset of the functionality provided by this method.
