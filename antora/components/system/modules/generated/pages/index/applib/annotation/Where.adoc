Represents the location in the user interface where a class member is to be rendered.Framework Implementation Notes

Used to control visibility (eg using the _Hidden_ annotation) and enablement (eg using the _Disabled_ annotation) in different regions of the user interface.

The application programmer may use any of the values of this enum. Some represent concrete locations (eg _#OBJECT_FORMS_ , _#PARENTED_TABLES_ ), whereas some represent a combination of locations (eg _#ALL_TABLES_ , _#ANYWHERE_ ).

This enum is also used internally within the framework. When rendering an element, the framework developer should only use those values that represent concrete locations.

<.> `[teal]#*_EVERYWHERE_*#`
+
--
The member should be disabled/hidden everywhere.

Synonym for _#ANYWHERE_ .
--
<.> `[teal]#*_ANYWHERE_*#`
+
--
The member should be disabled/hidden everywhere.

Synonym for _#EVERYWHERE_ .
--
<.> `[teal]#*_OBJECT_FORMS_*#`
+
--
The member should be disabled/hidden when displayed within an object form.

For most viewers, this applies to property and collection pathsToInclude, not actions.
--
<.> `[teal]#*_REFERENCES_PARENT_*#`
+
--
The member should be disabled/hidden when displayed as a column of a table within parent object's collection, and references that parent.

For most (all?) viewers, this will have meaning only if applied to a property member.
--
<.> `[teal]#*_PARENTED_TABLES_*#`
+
--
The member should be disabled/hidden when displayed as a column of a table within a parent object's collection.

For most (all?) viewers, this will have meaning only if applied to a property member.
--
<.> `[teal]#*_STANDALONE_TABLES_*#`
+
--
The member should be disabled/hidden when displayed as a column of a table showing a standalone list of objects, for example as returned by a repository query.

For most (all?) viewers, this will have meaning only if applied to a property member.
--
<.> `[teal]#*_ALL_TABLES_*#`
+
--
The member should be disabled/hidden when displayed as a column of a table, either an object's collection or a standalone list.

This combines _#PARENTED_TABLES_ and _#STANDALONE_TABLES_ .
--
<.> `[teal]#*_ALL_EXCEPT_STANDALONE_TABLES_*#`
+
--
The member should be disabled/hidden except when displayed as a column of a standalone table.

This is the inverse of _#STANDALONE_TABLES_ .
--
<.> `[teal]#*_NOWHERE_*#`
+
--
To act as an override if a member would normally be hidden as a result of some other convention.

For example, if a property is annotated with `@Title` , then normally this should be hidden from all tables. Additionally annotating with `@Hidden(where=Where.NOWHERE)` overrides this.
--
<.> `[teal]#*_NOT_SPECIFIED_*#`
+
--
Acts as the default no-op value for _PropertyLayout#hidden()_ , _CollectionLayout#hidden()_ and _ActionLayout#hidden()_ .
--
<.> `[teal]#*includes*#(xref:system:generated:index/applib/annotation/Where.adoc[Where] context)` : `boolean`
+
--
Whether this `Where` is a superset of the context `Where` provided.

For example, _#ALL_TABLES_ includes _#STANDALONE_TABLES_ ; _#ANYWHERE_ includes all others.
