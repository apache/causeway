  AS_CONFIGURED     // <.>

<.> `[teal]#*_AS_CONFIGURED_*#`
+
--
Prompt using the style configured by `isis.viewer.wicket.promptStyle` .

If no style is configured, then _#INLINE_ is assumed.
--
<.> `[teal]#*_DIALOG_*#`
+
--
Use a dialog for the prompt.

This will be either modal dialog (same as if _#DIALOG_MODAL_ was selected) or sidebar (same as if _#DIALOG_SIDEBAR_ was selected) depending on the value of the `isis.viweer.wicket.dialogModeconfiguration property.
--
<.> `[teal]#*_DIALOG_SIDEBAR_*#`
+
--
Use a dialog for the prompt, rendered in a sidebar.
--
<.> `[teal]#*_DIALOG_MODAL_*#`
+
--
Use a dialog for the prompt, rendered in a modal dialog.
--
<.> `[teal]#*_INLINE_*#`
+
--
Show the form inline, temporarily replacing the rendering of the property.
--
<.> `[teal]#*_INLINE_AS_IF_EDIT_*#`
+
--
Applies only to actions, show the form inline, invoked as if editing the property.

Note that:

* Only one such action should have this attribute set per property. If there are multiple actions, then the first one discovered with the attribute is used.
* If the property is editable, then this attribute is ignored (and the action is treated as having a prompt style of _#INLINE_ ).
* If applied to a property, then is the property's prompt style is simply treated as _#INLINE_ .

--
<.> `[teal]#*_NOT_SPECIFIED_*#`
+
--
Ignore the value provided by this annotation (meaning that the framework will keep searching, in meta annotations or superclasses/interfaces).
