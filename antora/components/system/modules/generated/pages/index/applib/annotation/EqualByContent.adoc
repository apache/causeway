Indicates that the class follows the equal-by-content contract, usually associated with xref:system:generated:index/applib/annotation/Value.adoc[Value] types.

If a class claims to be equal-by-content then its _#equals(Object)_ should return `true` if its content (as opposed to identity) is the same. For example, _String_ , _BigDecimal_ and _Date_ follow this contract.

Note also that the Java Language Specification requires that two objects that are _#equals(Object) equal_ must return the same value from _#hashCode()_ . Failure to do this means that that the object will not behave correctly when used as a key into a hashing structure (eg a _HashMap_ ).

By default any xref:system:generated:index/applib/annotation/Value.adoc[Value] types are assumed to follow the equal-by-content rule, though this can be overridden if required. Value types are usually also immutable (though there are some classic exceptions to this, such as _Date_ ).
