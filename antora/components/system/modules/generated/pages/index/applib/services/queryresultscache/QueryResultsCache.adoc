This service (API and implementation) provides a mechanism by which idempotent query results can be cached for the duration of an interaction. Most commonly this allows otherwise "naive" - eg that makes a repository call many times within a loop - to be performance tuned. The benefit is that the algorithm of the business logic can remain easy to understand.

This implementation has no UI and there is only one implementation (this class) in applib, it is annotated with _org.apache.isis.applib.annotation.DomainService_ . This means that it is automatically registered and available for use; no further configuration is required.
