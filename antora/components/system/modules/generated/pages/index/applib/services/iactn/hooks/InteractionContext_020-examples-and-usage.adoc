== Usage Notes

Typically domain objects will have little need to interact with the `InteractionContext` and `Interaction` directly.
The services are used within the framework however, primarily to support the xref:refguide:applib-svc:ExecutionSubscriber.adoc[ExecutionSubscriber] SPI, and to emit domain events over the xref:refguide:applib-svc:EventBusService.adoc[`EventBusService`].
