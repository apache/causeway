== Members

[#CURRENT]
=== CURRENT

The current layout for the domain class.

If a `layout.xml` exists, then the grid returned will correspond to that grid, having been _org.apache.isis.applib.services.grid.GridService#normalize(Grid) normalized_ . If there is no `layout.xml` file, then the grid returned will be the _org.apache.isis.applib.services.grid.GridService#defaultGridFor(Class) default grid_ , also _org.apache.isis.applib.services.grid.GridService#normalize(Grid) normalized_ .

[#COMPLETE]
=== COMPLETE

As per _#NORMALIZED_ , but also with all (non-null) facets for all properties/collections/actions also included included in the grid.

The intention here is that any layout metadata annotations can be removed from the code.

* _@MemberGroupLayout_ : *serialized as XML*
* _@MemberOrder_ : *serialized as XML*
* _@ActionLayout, @PropertyLayout, @CollectionLayout_ : *serialized as XML*

[#NORMALIZED]
=== NORMALIZED

Default, whereby missing properties/collections/actions are added to regions, and unused/empty regions are removed/trimmed.

It should be possible to remove any xref:system:generated:index/applib/annotation/MemberOrder.adoc[MemberOrder] annotation but any property/collection/action layout annotations would need to be retained.

* _@MemberGroupLayout_ : *serialized as XML*
* _@MemberOrder_ : *serialized as XML*
* _@ActionLayout, @PropertyLayout, @CollectionLayout_ : *ignored*

[#MINIMAL]
=== MINIMAL

As per _#NORMALIZED_ , but with no properties/collections/actions.

The intention here is for layout annotations that "bind" the properties/collections/actions to the regions to be retained.

* _@MemberGroupLayout_ : *serialized as XML*
* _@MemberOrder_ : *ignored*
* _@ActionLayout, @PropertyLayout, @CollectionLayout_ : *ignored*
