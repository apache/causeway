Provides the current thread's xref:system:generated:index/applib/services/iactn/Interaction.adoc[Interaction] .

An xref:system:generated:index/applib/services/iactn/Interaction.adoc[Interaction] contains a top-level xref:system:generated:index/applib/services/iactn/Execution.adoc[Execution] representing the invocation of an action or the editing of a property. If that top-level action or property uses the _org.apache.isis.applib.services.wrapper.WrapperFactory_ domain service to invoke child actions/properties, then those sub-executions are captured as a call-graph. The xref:system:generated:index/applib/services/iactn/Execution.adoc[Execution] is thus a graph structure.
