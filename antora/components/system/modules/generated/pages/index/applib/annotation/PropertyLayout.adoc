== Members

[#cssClass]
=== cssClass

Indicates the css class that a property should have.

[#describedAs]
=== describedAs

Description of this property, eg to be rendered in a tooltip.

[#hidden]
=== hidden

Indicates where in the UI the property should _not_ not be visible.

[#labelPosition]
=== labelPosition

In forms, positioning of the label (left, top or none) relative to the property value.

If not specified, the default depends upon the property value's datatype.

[#multiLine]
=== multiLine

For string properties (and parameters), render as a text area over specified number of lines.

[#named]
=== named

Name of this property (overriding the name derived from its name in code).

[#namedEscaped]
=== namedEscaped

A flag indicating whether the value of _#named()_ should be HTML escaped or not.

[#navigable]
=== navigable

Whether this property should be used to construct the navigable chain of breadcrumbs in the UI.

Only one property can be annotated as such per domain class.

[#promptStyle]
=== promptStyle

How the properties of this domain object are be edited, either _PromptStyle#DIALOG dialog_ or _PromptStyle#INLINE inline_ .

[#renderDay]
=== renderDay

For date properties (and parameters) only, instructs the viewer that the date should be rendered as one day prior to the actually stored date.

This is intended to be used so that an exclusive end date of an interval can be rendered as 1 day before the actual value stored.

For example:

----

public LocalDate getStartDate() { ... }

@PropertyLayout(renderDay=RenderDay.AS_DAY_BEFORE)
public LocalDate getEndDate() { ... }
----

Here, the interval of the [1-may-2013,1-jun-2013) would be rendered as the dates 1-may-2013 for the start date but using 31-may-2013 (the day before) for the end date. What is stored In the domain object, itself, however, the value stored is 1-jun-2013.

[#repainting]
=== repainting

Indicates that the value held by the property never changes over time, even when other properties of the object do change.

Setting this attribute to `RepaintPolicy.NO_REPAINT` is used as a hint to the viewer to not repaint the property after an AJAX update of some other property/ies of the object have changed. This is primarily for performance, eg can improve the user experience when rendering PDFs/blobs.

Note that for this to work, the viewer will also ensure that none of the property's parent component (such as a tab group panel) are re-rendered.

Design note: we considered implementing this an "immutable" flag on the xref:system:generated:index/applib/annotation/Property.adoc[Property] annotation (because this flag is typically appropriate for immutable/unchanging properties of a domain object). However, we decided not to do that, on the basis that it might be interpreted as having a deeper impact within the framework than simply a hint for rendering.

[#typicalLength]
=== typicalLength

The typical entry length of a field, use to determine the optimum width for display
