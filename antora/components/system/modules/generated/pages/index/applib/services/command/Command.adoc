Represents the _intention to_ invoke either an action or modify a property. There can be only one such intention per (web) request, so a command is in effect interaction-scoped.

Each Command holds a _CommandDto_ (see Apache Isiscmdschema) which reifies all the details in a serializable form.

It also captures details of the corresponding action invocation (or property edit), specifically when that action/edit _Command#getStartedAt() started_ or _Command#getCompletedAt() completed_ , and its result, either a _Command#getResult() return value_ or an _Command#getException() exception_ . Also captures a stack of xref:system:generated:index/applib/events/domain/ActionDomainEvent.adoc[ActionDomainEvent] s.

Note that when invoking an action, other actions may be invoked courtesy of the xref:system:generated:index/applib/services/wrapper/WrapperFactory.adoc[WrapperFactory] . These "sub-actions" do _not_ modify the contents of the current command object; in other words think of the command object as representing the outer-most originating action.

That said, if the sub-action is invoked asynchronously (using _WrapperFactory#asyncWrap(Object, AsyncControl)_ or _WrapperFactory#asyncWrapMixin(Class, Object, AsyncControl)_ ), then a separate xref:system:generated:index/applib/services/command/Command.adoc[Command] object is created, and the originating xref:system:generated:index/applib/services/command/Command.adoc[Command] is set to be its _Command#getParent() parent_ .
