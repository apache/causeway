Represents an action invocation or property modification, resulting in some state change of the system. It captures not only the target object and arguments passed, but also builds up the call-graph, and captures metrics, eg for profiling.

The distinction between xref:system:generated:index/Command.adoc[Command] and this object is perhaps subtle: the former represents the intention to invoke an action/edit a property, whereas this represents the actual invocation/edit itself.

To confuse matters slightly, historically the xref:system:generated:index/Command.adoc[Command] interface defines members (specifically: _Command#getStartedAt()_ , _Command#getCompletedAt()_ , _Command#getResult()_ , _Command#getException()_ ) which logically belong to this class instead; they remain in xref:system:generated:index/Command.adoc[Command] for backward compatibility only (and have been deprecated).

NOTE: you could also think of this interface as being analogous to the (database) transaction. The name "Transaction" has not been used for the interface not chosen however because there is also the system-level transaction that manages the persistence of the xref:system:generated:index/Command.adoc[Command] object itself.

The current (most recently pushed) _Execution_ .

The execution that preceded the current one.

Generates numbers in a named sequence. The name of the sequence can be arbitrary, though note that the framework also uses this capability to generate sequence numbers corresponding to the sequences enumerated by the _Sequence_ enum.
