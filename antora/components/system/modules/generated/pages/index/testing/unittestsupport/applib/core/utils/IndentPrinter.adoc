<.> `[teal]#*IndentPrinter*#(Writer out, String indent)`
+
--
Creates an IndentPrinter backed by the supplied Writer, with a user-supplied String to be used for indenting.
--
<.> `[teal]#*IndentPrinter*#(Writer out, String indent, boolean addNewlines)`
+
--
Creates an IndentPrinter backed by the supplied Writer, with a user-supplied String to be used for indenting and the ability to override newline handling.

+
--
Prints a string.
