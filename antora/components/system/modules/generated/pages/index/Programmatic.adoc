Indicates that an property, collection or action is to be called programmatically and should be ignored from the metamodel.

For example, it may be a helper method that needs to be `public` but that doesn't conform to the requirements of an action (for example, invalid parameter types).

It can also be added to a type, meaning that the type is ignored from the metamodel. This is intended as a "get out of jail" for any classes from unit tests, say, that end up on the classpath of integration tests but should otherwise be ignored.
