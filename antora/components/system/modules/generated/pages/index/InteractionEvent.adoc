= InteractionEvent : _class_



 _Supported only by _org.apache.isis.applib.services.wrapper.WrapperFactory_ service,_ represents an interaction with a domain object or a particular feature (property, collection, action) of a domain object.
Many of the interactions are checks for _VisibilityEvent visibility_ , _UsabilityEvent usability_ and _ValidityEvent validity_ .

* `[teal]#*getSource*#()` : `Object`
+
The domain object (pojo) against which the interaction occurred.


* `[teal]#*getIdentifier*#()` : `Identifier`
+
The _Identifier_ of the feature of the object being interacted with.
+
Will be consistent with the subclass of xref:system:generated:index/InteractionEvent.adoc[InteractionEvent] . So for example a xref:system:generated:index/PropertyModifyEvent.adoc[PropertyModifyEvent] will have an _Identifier_ that identifies the property being modified.


* `[teal]#*getClassName*#()` : `String`
+
As per _#getClassName()_ , but naturalized.


* `[teal]#*getClassNaturalName*#()` : `String`
+
Convenience method that returns the _Identifier#getClassNaturalName() natural class name_ of the _#getIdentifier() identifier_ .


* `[teal]#*getMemberName*#()` : `String`
+
Convenience method that returns the _Identifier#getMemberName() member name_ of the _#getIdentifier() identifier_ .


* `[teal]#*getMemberNaturalName*#()` : `String`
+
As per _#getMemberName()_ , but naturalized.


* `[teal]#*getMemberParameterNames*#()` : `List<String>`
+
Convenience method that returns the _Identifier#getClassName() class name_ of the _#getIdentifier() identifier_ .


* `[teal]#*getMemberParameterNaturalNames*#()` : `List<String>`
+
As per _#getMemberParameterName()_ , but naturalized.


* `[teal]#*getReason*#()` : `String`
+
The reason, if any, that this interaction may have been vetoed or otherwise disallowed.
+
Intended to be _#setExecuteIn(String) set_ as a result of consulting one of the facets.


* `[teal]#*getReasonMessage*#()` : `String`
+
The reason message, if any, that this interaction may have been vetoed or otherwise disallowed.
+
This message should be overridden by subclasses for containing the Reason, the Identifier and any other relevant context information.


* `[teal]#*getAdvisorClass*#()` : `Class<?>`
+
The class of the (first) advisor, if any, that provided the _#getReason() reason_ that this interaction is _#isVeto() vetoed_ .


* `[teal]#*advised*#(String reason, Class<?> advisorClass)` : `void`
+
Specify the _#getReason() reason_ that this interaction has been vetoed and the _#getAdvisorClass() class of the advisor_ that did the veto.


* `[teal]#*isVeto*#()` : `boolean`
+
Whether this interaction has been vetoed (meaning that _#getReason()_ and _#getAdvisorClass()_ will both be non- `null` and the _#getReason() reason_ non-empty.)
+
The interpretation of this depends on the subclass:
+
** for xref:system:generated:index/VisibilityEvent.adoc[VisibilityEvent] , a veto means that the feature (property, collection, action) is hidden
+
** for xref:system:generated:index/UsabilityEvent.adoc[UsabilityEvent] , a veto means that the feature is disabled
+
** for xref:system:generated:index/ValidityEvent.adoc[ValidityEvent] , a veto means that the proposed modification (property value, object added/removed, action argument) is invalid
