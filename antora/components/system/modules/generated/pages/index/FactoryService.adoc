* `[teal]#*getOrCreate*#<T>(Class<T> requiredType)` : `T`
+
--
General purpose factory method, to automatically get or create an instance of _requiredType_ .

Maps onto one of the specialized factory methods _#get(Class)_ or _#create(Class)_ based on the type's meta-data.
--
* `[teal]#*get*#<T>(Class<T> requiredType)` : `T`
+
--
Gets an instance (possibly shared or independent) of the specified _requiredType_ , with injection points resolved and any life-cycle callback processed.
--
* `[teal]#*detachedEntity*#<T>(Class<T> domainClass)` : `T`
+
--
Creates a new detached entity instance, with injection points resolved and defaults applied.
--
* `[teal]#*detachedEntity*#<T>(T entity)` : `T`
+
--
Creates a new detached entity instance, with injection points resolved.
--
* `[teal]#*mixin*#<T>(Class<T> mixinClass, Object mixedIn)` : `T`
+
--
Creates a new Mixin instance, with injection points resolved.
--
* `[teal]#*viewModel*#<T>(Class<T> viewModelClass, String mementoStr)` : `T`
+
--
Creates a new ViewModel instance, with injection points resolved, and initialized according to the given _mementoStr_
--
* `[teal]#*viewModel*#<T>(Class<T> viewModelClass)` : `T`
+
--
Creates a new ViewModel instance, with injection points resolved and defaults applied.
--
* `[teal]#*viewModel*#<T>(T viewModel)` : `T`
+
--
Resolves injection points for given ViewModel instance.
--
* `[teal]#*create*#<T>(Class<T> domainClass)` : `T`
+
--
Creates a new instance of the specified class, with injection points resolved and defaults applied.
--
* `[line-through gray]#*instantiate*#<T>(Class<T> domainClass)` : `T`
+

[red]#_deprecated:_#

with semantic changes since 2.0 previous behavior is no longer guaranteed, instead consider use of @ _#detachedEntity(Class)_ or _#getOrCreate(Class)_ if applicable

Creates a new instance of the specified class, but does not persist it.

It is recommended that the object be initially instantiated using this method, though the framework will also handle the case when the object is simply _new()_ ed up. The benefits of using _#instantiate(Class)_ are:

+
--
any services will be injected into the object immediately (otherwise they will not be injected until the framework becomes aware of the object, typically when it is _RepositoryService#persist(Object) persist_ ed
--
+
--
the default value for any properties (usually as specified by `default _Xxx_ ()` supporting methods) will (since 2.0) be used
--
+
--
the `created()` callback will not be called.
--

The corollary is: if your code never uses `default _Xxx_ ()` supporting methods or the `created()` callback, then you can alternatively just _new()_ up the object rather than call this method.
