Iterates over all _#contentNegotiationServices injected_ xref:system:generated:index/viewer/restfulobjects/rendering/service/conneg/ContentNegotiationService.adoc[ContentNegotiationService] s to find one that returns a _ResponseBuilder_ using the provided function.

There will always be at least one such service, namely the xref:system:generated:index/viewer/restfulobjects/rendering/service/conneg/ContentNegotiationServiceForRestfulObjectsV1_0.adoc[ContentNegotiationServiceForRestfulObjectsV1_0] .
