Only enabled for the `secondary` profile, where it sets up the framework to use _TickingFixtureClock_ so that time can be changed dynamically when running.

As an additional safeguard, if the configuration keys to access the primary are not provided, then the service will not initialize.

IMPORTANT: the methods provided by this service are not thread-safe, because the clock is a globally-scoped singleton rather than a thread-local. These methods should therefore only be used in single-user systems, eg a replay secondary.
