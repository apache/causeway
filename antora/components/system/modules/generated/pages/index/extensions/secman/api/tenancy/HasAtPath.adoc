Previously theatPathwould have corresponded to the unique path of some particular xref:system:generated:index/extensions/secman/api/tenancy/ApplicationTenancy.adoc[ApplicationTenancy] instance. However, this has now been generalized; the atPath is simply a string whose interpretation is application-specific (in particular by the xref:system:generated:index/extensions/secman/api/tenancy/ApplicationTenancyEvaluator.adoc[ApplicationTenancyEvaluator] SPI).

For applications that still wish to follow the original more specific design (that theatPathcorresponds to a single xref:system:generated:index/extensions/secman/api/tenancy/ApplicationTenancy.adoc[ApplicationTenancy] ), then the path can be interpreted according to the following table:

any object that is not tenanted (that is, its class does not implement xref:system:generated:index/extensions/secman/api/tenancy/HasAtPath.adoc[HasAtPath] is accessible by any user (usual permission rules apply).
