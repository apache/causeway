=== getCalendarName

The name of the calendar to which this event belongs.

For example, an `Employee` might provide have a `employedOn` , so the calendar name would be "employedOn"

If there is possibly more than one date associated with the entity, then use xref:system:generated:index/extensions/fullcalendar/applib/Calendarable.adoc[Calendarable] instead.
