This service (API and implementation) provides a mechanism to interchange information between multiple objects invoked in the same interaction. Most commonly this will be as the result of invoking a _org.apache.isis.applib.annotation.Bulk_ action.

This implementation has only one implementation (this class) in applib, so it is annotated with _org.apache.isis.applib.annotation.DomainService_ . This means that it is automatically registered and available for use; no further configuration is required.
