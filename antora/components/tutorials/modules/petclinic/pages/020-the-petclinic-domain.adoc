= An Example Domain

By now you should understand the basics of what Apache Isis does, but there's only so much we can learn from a single domain class.
Let's therefore evolve the app into a slightly more interesting domain and explore other features of the framework.

The domain we're going to work on is a version of the venerable "Pet Clinic" app.
Here's a sketch of (our version of) its domain:

[TIP]

The colours used are from "Java: Modeling in Color" book by Coad et al.

Some of the use cases we might want to support include:

* create a `PetOwner`
* add and remove ``Pet``s for said `PetOwner`
* book a `Pet` in for a `Visit`
* enter an `outcome` and `cost` of a `Visit`
* allow a `PetOwner` to pay for a `Visit`
* find ``Visit``s not yet paid and overdue
* delete a `PetOwner` and its ``Pet``s and ``Visit``s, so long as there are no unpaid ``Visit``s.

This tutorial has worked solutions for all of these.

[#exercise-2-1-refactor-simpleobject-to-petowner]
== Exercise 2.1: Refactor `SimpleObject` to `PetOwner`

To start with, let's rename the `SimpleObject` entity to `PetOwner`

=== Solution

[source,bash]
----
git checkout tags/02-01-renames-SimpleObject-to-PetOwner
mvn clean install
mvn -pl spring-boot:run
----

=== Tasks

Just checkout the solution above and review the git history to see the changes that have already been made.
These include:

* Domain classes renamed (along with corresponding tests)

** `SimpleObject` entity -> `PetOwner`
** `SimpleObjects` domain service -> `PetOwners`
** `SimpleObjectRepository` repository service -> `PetOwnerRepository`

** Infrastructure classes renamed

** `SimpleModule` -> `PetsModule`
** `SimpleApp` -> `PetClinicApp`


Build and run the application (note that the main class has changed) to make sure it still runs fine.
