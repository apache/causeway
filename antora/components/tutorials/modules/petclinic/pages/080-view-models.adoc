So far the application consists only of domain entities and domain services.
However, the framework also supports view models.

A classic use case is to provide a home page or dashboard, but they are also used to represent certain specific business processes when there isn't necessarily a domain entity required to track the state of the process itself.
Some real-world examples include importing/exporting spreadsheets periodically (eg changes to indexation rates), or generating extracts such as a payment file or summary PDF for an quarterly invoice run.



[#exercise-8-1-extend-the-home-page]
== Exercise 8.1: Extend the Home Page.

In this exercise we'll extend the home page by displaying additional data in new collections.


=== Solution

[source,bash]
----
git checkout tags/08-01-home-page-additional-collections
mvn clean install
mvn -pl spring-boot:run
----


=== Tasks

* update `PetRepository` and `VisitRepository` to extend `JpaRepository` (rather than simply `Repository`)
+
This will provide additional finders "for free".

* modify `HomePageViewModel` to show the current ``PetOwner``s, ``Pet``s and ``Visit``s in three separate columns:
+
[source,java]
----
@DomainObject(
        nature = Nature.VIEW_MODEL,                             // <.>
        logicalTypeName = "petclinic.HomePageViewModel"
        )
@HomePage                                                       // <.>
@DomainObjectLayout()
public class HomePageViewModel {

    public String title() {
        return getPetOwners().size() + " owners";
    }

    public List<PetOwner> getPetOwners() {                      // <.>
        return petOwnerRepository.findAll();
    }
    public List<Pet> getPets() {                                // <.>
        return petRepository.findAll();
    }
    public List<Visit> getVisits() {                            // <.>
        return visitRepository.findAll();
    }

    @Inject PetOwnerRepository petOwnerRepository;
    @Inject PetRepository petRepository;
    @Inject VisitRepository visitRepository;
}
----
<.> indicates that this is a view model.
<.> exactly one view model can be annotated as the xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/HomePage.adoc[@HomePage]
<.> renamed derived collection, returns ``PetOwner``s.
<.> new derived collection returning all ``Pet``s.
<.> new derived collection returning all ``Visits``s.

* update the `HomePageViewModel.layout.xml`:

[source,xml]
.HomePageViewModel.layout.xml
----
<!-- ... -->
    <bs3:row>
        <bs3:col span="12" unreferencedCollections="true">
            <bs3:row>
                <bs3:col span="4">
                    <collection id="petOwners" defaultView="table"/>
                </bs3:col>
                <bs3:col span="4">
                    <collection id="pets" defaultView="table"/>
                </bs3:col>
                <bs3:col span="4">
                    <collection id="visits" defaultView="table"/>
                </bs3:col>
            </bs3:row>
        </bs3:col>
    </bs3:row>
<!-- ... -->
----

* update or add columnOrder.txt files for the 3 collections.



[#exercise-8-2-add-a-convenience-action]
== Exercise 8.2: Add a convenience action

View models can have behaviour (actions), the same as entities.
In this exercise we'll extend the home page by providing a convenience action to book a `Visit` for any `Pet` of any `PetOwner`.


=== Solution

[source,bash]
----
git checkout tags/08-02-home-page-bookVisit-convenience-action
mvn clean install
mvn -pl spring-boot:run
----


=== Tasks

* create a bookVisit action for HomePageViewModel, as a mixin:
+
[source,java]
.HomePageViewModel_bookVisit.java
----
@Action                                                                                 // <.>
@RequiredArgsConstructor
public class HomePageViewModel_bookVisit {                                              // <.>

    final HomePageViewModel homePageViewModel;

    public Object act(
            PetOwner petOwner, Pet pet, LocalDateTime visitAt, String reason,
            boolean showVisit) {                                                               // <.>
        Visit visit = wrapperFactory.wrapMixin(Pet_bookVisit.class, pet).act(visitAt, reason); // <.>
        return showVisit ? visit : homePageViewModel;
    }
    public List<PetOwner> autoComplete0Act(final String lastName) {                     // <.>
        return petOwnerRepository.findByLastNameContaining(lastName);
    }
    public List<Pet> choices1Act(PetOwner petOwner) {                                   // <.>
        if(petOwner == null) return Collections.emptyList();
        return petRepository.findByPetOwner(petOwner);
    }
    public LocalDateTime default2Act(PetOwner petOwner, Pet pet) {                      // <.>
        if(pet == null) return null;
        return factoryService.mixin(Pet_bookVisit.class, pet).default0Act();
    }
    public String validate2Act(PetOwner petOwner, Pet pet, LocalDateTime visitAt) {     // <.>
         return factoryService.mixin(Pet_bookVisit.class, pet).validate0Act(visitAt);
    }

    @Inject PetRepository petRepository;
    @Inject PetOwnerRepository petOwnerRepository;
    @Inject WrapperFactory wrapperFactory;
    @Inject FactoryService factoryService;
}
----
<.> declares this class as a mixin action.
<.> The action name is derived from the mixin's class ("bookVisit").
<.> cosmetic flag to control the UI; either remain at the home page or navigate to the newly created `Visit
<.> use the xref:refguide:applib:index/services/wrapper/WrapperFactory.adoc[WrapperFactory] to delegate to the original behaviour "as if" through the UI.
If additional business rules were added to that delegate, then the mistake would be detected.
<.> Uses an xref:refguide:applib-methods:prefixes.adoc#autoComplete[autoComplete] supporting method to look up matching ``PetOwner``s based upon their name.
<.> Finds the ``Pet``s owned by the `PetOwner`, once selected.
<.> Computes a default for the 2^nd^ parameter, once the first two are selected.
<.> surfaces (some of) the business rules of the delegate mixin.

* update the layout file to position:
+
[source,xml]
.HomePageViewModel.layout.xml
----
<!-- ... -->
    <bs3:row>
        <bs3:col span="12" unreferencedActions="true">
            <domainObject/>
            <action id="bookVisit"/>
            <!-- ... -->

[#exercise-8-3-using-a-view-model-as-a-projection-of-an-entity]
== Exercise 8.3: Using a view model as a projection of an entity

In the home page, the ``Visit`` instances show the `Pet` but they do not show the `PetOwner`.
One option (probably the correct one in this case) would be to extend `Visit` itself and show this derived information:

[source,java]
.Visit.java
----
public PetOwner getPetOwner() {
    return getPet().getOwner();
}
----

Alternatively, if we didn't want to "pollute" the entity with this derived property, we could use a mixin:

[source,java]
.Visit_petOwner.java
----
@Property
@RequiredArgsConstructor
public class Visit_petOwner {

    final Visit visit;

    public PetOwner prop() {
        return visit.getPet().getOwner();
    }
}
----

Even so, this would still make the "petOwner" property visible everywhere that a `Visit` is displayed.

If we instead want to be more targetted and _only_ show this "petOwner" property when displayed on the HomePage, yet another option is to implement the xref:refguide:applib:index/services/tablecol/TableColumnVisibilityService.adoc[TableColumnVisibilityService] SPI.
This provides the context for where an object is being rendered, so this could be used to suppress the collection everywhere except the home page.

A final option though, which we'll use in this exercise, is to display not the entity itself but instead a view model that "wraps" the entity and supplements with the additional data required.


=== Solution

[source,bash]
----
git checkout tags/08-03-view-model-projecting-an-entity
mvn clean install
mvn -pl spring-boot:run
----


=== Tasks

* create a JAXB style view model `VisitPlusPetOwner`, wrapping the `Visit` entity:
+
[source,java]
.VisitPlusPetOwner.java
----
@DomainObject(nature=Nature.VIEW_MODEL, logicalTypeName = "petclinic.VisitPlusPetOwner")
@DomainObjectLayout(named = "Visit")
@XmlRootElement                                                     // <.>
@XmlType                                                            // <1>
@XmlAccessorType(XmlAccessType.FIELD)                               // <1>
@NoArgsConstructor
public class VisitPlusPetOwner {

    @Property(
            projecting = Projecting.PROJECTED,                      // <.>
            hidden = Where.EVERYWHERE                               // <.>
    )
    @Getter
    private Visit visit;

    VisitPlusPetOwner(Visit visit) {this.visit = visit;}

    public Pet getPet() {return visit.getPet();}                    // <.>
    public String getReason() {return visit.getReason();}           // <4>
    public LocalDateTime getVisitAt() {return visit.getVisitAt();}  // <4>

    public PetOwner getPetOwner() {                                 // <.>
        return getPet().getPetOwner();
    }
}
----
<.> Boilerplate for JAXB view models
<.> if the icon/title is clicked, then traverse to this object rather than the view model.
(The view model is a "projection" of the underlying `Visit`).
<.> Nevertheless, hide this property from the UI.
<.> expose properties from the underlying `Visit` entity
<.> add in additional derived properties, in this case the ``Pet``'s owner.

* Refactor the `getVisits` collection of `HomePageViewModel` to use the new view model:
+
[source,java]
.VisitPlusPetOwner.java
----
public List<VisitPlusPetOwner> getVisits() {
    return visitRepository.findAll()
            .stream()
            .map(VisitPlusPetOwner::new)
            .collect(Collectors.toList());
}
----

* update the columnOrder file for this collection to display the new property:
+
[source,java]
.HomePageViewModel#visits.columnOrder.txt
----
petOwner
pet
visitAt
----

Run the application; the `visits` collection on the home page should now show the `PetOwner` as an additional column, but otherwise behaves the same as previously.
