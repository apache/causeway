This tutorial develops a variant of the venerable "pet clinic" app, broken up into a set of exercises.

To guide you through those exercises, we've provided a git repo (https://github.com/apache/causeway-app-petclinic) with a set of tags, each tag representing the solution to one exercise and the starting point to the next.
