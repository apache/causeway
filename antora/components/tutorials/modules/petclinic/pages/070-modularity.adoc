Keeping applications modular is key to their long-term maintainability.
If every class potentially can depend on any other class, we'll end up with a "big ball of mud" that becomes almost impossible to change.

Instead, we need to ensure that the dependency graph between packages remains acyclic.
The framework provides two main tools:

* the first we've already seen is mixins.
+
These allow us to locate busines logic in one module that "appears" to reside in another module.
Examples are the `visits` mixin collection and `bookVisit` mixin action that are both contributed by the `visits` module to the `Pet` entity in the `pets` module.

* the second is domain events.
+
These we haven't yet seen, but provide a way for one module to react to (or to veto) actions performed in logic in another module.

In this part of the tutorial we'll look at domain events.



[#exercise-7-1-refactor-petowners-delete-action]
== Exercise 7.1: refactor PetOwner's delete action

Currently the `delete` action for `PetOwner` is implemented as a mixin within the `Pet` package.
That's a nice place for that functionality, because it can delete any `Pet`s for the `PetOwner` if any exist.

However, we also have added `Visit`, which has the same issue: we cannot delete a `Pet` if there are associated ``Visit``s.
And, in fact, we don't want to allow a `PetOwner` and their ``Pet``s from being deleted if there are ``Visit``s in the database; they might not have paid!

In this exercise we will move the responsibility to delete an action back to `PetOwner`, and then use subscribers for both `Pet` and `Visit` to cascade delete or to veto the action respectively if there are related objects.



=== Solution

[source,bash]
----
git checkout tags/07-01-delete-action-events
mvn clean install
mvn -pl spring-boot:run
----

To test this out:

* try deleting a `PetOwner` where none of their ``Pet``s have any ``Visit``s; the action should succeed, and the `PetOwner` and the ``Pet``s should all be deleted.

* now book a `Visit` for a `Pet`, then navigate back to the parent `PetOwner` and attempt to delete it.
This time the action should be vetoed, because of that `Visit`.


=== Tasks

* in `PetOwner_delete` remove the code that deletes the ``Pet``s.
In its place, define a subclass of xref:refguide:applib-classes:events.adoc#domain-event-classes[ActionDomainEvent] as a nested class of the mixin, and reference in the xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/Action.adoc#domainEvent[@Action#domainEvent] attribute.
+
[source,java]
.PetOwner_delete.java
----
@Action(
        domainEvent = PetOwner_delete.ActionEvent.class,            // <.>
        semantics = SemanticsOf.NON_IDEMPOTENT_ARE_YOU_SURE,
        commandPublishing = Publishing.ENABLED,
        executionPublishing = Publishing.ENABLED
)
@ActionLayout(
        associateWith = "name", position = ActionLayout.Position.PANEL,
        describedAs = "Deletes this object from the persistent datastore")
@RequiredArgsConstructor
public class PetOwner_delete {

    public static class ActionEvent                                 // <.>
            extends ActionDomainEvent<PetOwner_delete>{}

    private final PetOwner petOwner;

    public void act() {
        repositoryService.remove(petOwner);
        return;
    }

    @Inject RepositoryService repositoryService;
}
----
<.> specifies the domain event to emit when the action is called
<.> declares the action event (as a subclass of the framework's xref:refguide:applib-classes:events.adoc#domain-event-classes[ActionDomainEvent]).

* create a subscriber in the `pets` package to delete all ``Pet``s when the `PetOwner_delete` action is invoked:
+
[source,java]
.PetOwnerForPetsSubscriber.java
----
@Service
public class PetOwnerForPetsSubscriber {

    @EventListener(PetOwner_delete.ActionEvent.class)
    public void on(PetOwner_delete.ActionEvent ev) {
        switch(ev.getEventPhase()) {
            case EXECUTING:                                             // <.>
                PetOwner petOwner = ev.getSubject();                    // <.>
                List<Pet> pets = petRepository.findByPetOwner(petOwner);
                pets.forEach(repositoryService::remove);
                break;
        }
    }

    @Inject PetRepository petRepository;
    @Inject RepositoryService repositoryService;
}
----
<.> events are emitted at different phases.
The `EXECUTING` phase is fired before the delete action itself is fired, so is the ideal place for us to perform the cascade delete.
<.> is the mixee of the mixin that is emitting the event.

* create a subscriber in the `visits` module to veto the `PetOwner_delete` if there are any `Pet`s of the `PetOwner` with at least one `Visit`:
+
[source,java]
.PetOwnerForVisitsSubscriber.java
----
@Service
public class PetOwnerForVisitsSubscriber {

    @EventListener(PetOwner_delete.ActionEvent.class)
    public void on(PetOwner_delete.ActionEvent ev) {
        switch(ev.getEventPhase()) {
            case DISABLE:
                PetOwner petOwner = ev.getSubject();
                List<Pet> pets = petRepository.findByPetOwner(petOwner);
                for (Pet pet : pets) {
                    List<Visit> visits = visitRepository.findByPetOrderByVisitAtDesc(pet);
                    int numVisits = visits.size();
                    if(numVisits > 0) {
                        ev.disable(String.format("%s has %d visit%s",
                                titleService.titleOf(pet),
                                numVisits,
                                numVisits != 1 ? "s" : ""));
                    }
                }
                break;
        }
    }

    @Inject TitleService titleService;
    @Inject VisitRepository visitRepository;
    @Inject PetRepository petRepository;
}
----


=== Optional Exercise


Improve the implementation of `PetOwnerForVisitsSubscriber` so that it performs only a single database query to find if there are any ``Visit`` for the `PetOwner`.
