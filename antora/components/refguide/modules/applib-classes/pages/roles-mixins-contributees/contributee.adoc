The interfaces listed in this chapter act as contributees; they allow domain services to contribute actions/properties/collections to any domain objects that implement these interfaces.



== Usage Notes

If the interaction is an action that in turn calls other actions by way of xref:refguide:applib:index/services/wrapper/WrapperFactory.adoc[WrapperFactory]), then there may be several member executions, each with a unique sequence number, within the same transaction Id.

The purpose of this interface is to allow mixins to be defined, though the framework itself defines none.

Currently the only implementation of this interface is that for `PublishedObjects` applib interface as defined by the xref:refguide:applib:index/services/publishing/spi/ExecutionSubscriber.adoc[ExecutionSubscriber].


[[HasUserName]]
== `HasUsername`

The `HasUsername` interface is a mix-in for domain objects to be associated with a username.
Other services and modules can then contribute actions/collections to render such additional information relating to the activities of the user.

The interface is defined is:

[source,java]
----
public interface HasUsername {
    public String getUsername();
}
----

Some of the extension/mapping modules that have domain entity/ies that implement this interface are:

* xref:security:ROOT:about.adoc[SecMan extension]: `ApplicationUser` entity
* xref:security:audit-trail:about.adoc[Auditer] module: `AuditEntry` entity
* xref:extensions:command-log:about.adoc[Command Log] module: `CommandJdo` entity
* xref:mappings:outbox-publisher:about.adoc[Outbox Publisher] module: `OutboxEvent` entity
* xref:security:session-log:about.adoc[Session Log] module: `SessionLogEntry` entity
* xref:subdomains:settings:about.adoc[Settings] module: `UserSettingJdo` entity
