All domain entities automatically implement the DataNucleus `Persistable` role interface as a result of the enhancer process (the fully qualified class name is `org.datanucleus.enhancement.Persistable`).
So as a developer you do not need to write any code to obtain the mixins that contribute to this interface.

These mixin properties/actions are all associated with the "Metadata" fieldset.
A number of other xref:applib-classes:about.adoc#Object[mixins] also contribute properties or actions to the "Metadata" fieldset.



[#downloadJdoMetadata]
== `downloadJdoMetadata()`

The `Persistable_downloadJdoMetadata` mixin provides an action which allows the JDO link:http://www.datanucleus.org/products/datanucleus/jdo/metadata_xml.html[class metadata] to be downloaded as XML.
It has the following signature:

// TODO: v2: use include::[]

[source,java]
----
public Clob downloadJdoMetadata(                    // <.>

    @ParameterLayout(named = ".jdo file name")
    final String fileName) {
        // ...
    }

    // ...
}
----
<.> returns the XML text wrapped up in a xref:applib-classes:about.adoc#Clob[Clob].

The mixin delegates to the xref:pjdo:ROOT:services/IsisJdoSupport.adoc[IsisJdoSupport] service to obtain a reference to the JDO `PersistenceManagerFactory`.


[#datanucleusXxx]
== `datanucleusXxx`

The framework provides a number of mixins that expose the datanucleus Id and version of a persistable domain entity.
Several implementations are provided to support different datatypes:

* `Persistable_datanucleusIdLong` will expose the entity's id, assuming that the id is or can be cast to `java.lang.Long`.
Otherwise the property will be hidden.

* `Persistable_datanucleusVersionTimestamp` will expose the entity's version, assuming that the version is or can be cast to `java.sql.Timestamp`.
Otherwise the property will be hidden.

* `Persistable_datanucleusVersionLong` will expose the entity's version, assuming that the version is or can be cast to `java.lang.Long`.
Otherwise the property will be hidden.
