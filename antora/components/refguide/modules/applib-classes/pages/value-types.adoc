== Built-in: JDK types

Apache Causeway can render and persist all the JDK primitives and wrapper classes, and a number of other JDK classes that represent value types.

It also supports a number of value types that are shipped by the framework itself.

In addition to primitives, the JDK Classes supported are:

* the wrapper classes (in `java.lang`)
+
`Integer`, `Long`, `Short`, `Byte`, `Character`, `Float`, `Double`, `Boolean`

* strings and similar:

** `java.lang.String`
** any enum (subtype of `java.lang.Enum`)

* numeric data types for arbitrary accuracy:

** `java.math.BigDecimal` and `java.math.BigInteger`
+
These can be combined with `@Digits` to specify scale.

== Built-in: JDK Dates

Dates are also supported of course, though there are lots of options:

* in the `java.time` package; these are the most modern and generally is to be preferred:

** local times (no time zone):
+
`java.time.LocalDate,` `java.time.LocalTime`, `java.time.LocalDateTime`

** for storing date/time, with respect to the UTC:
+
`java.time.OffsetDateTime`, `java.time.OffsetTime`

** primarily for _displaying_ time in a specified time zone:
+
`java.time.ZonedDateTime`

* in the `java.util` package (usage is discouraged since these classes are not immutable):
+
`java.util.Date`

* in the `java.sql` package:
+
`java.sql.Date,` `java.sql.Timestamp`, `java.sql.Time`


== Built-in: Other JDK types

* miscellaneous:

** `java.net.URL`
** `java.util.UUID`
** `java.util.Locale`
** `java.awt.BufferedImage`

* xref:latest@vw:fullcalendar:about.adoc[] defines its own `CalendarEvent` value type.

== Framework-defined

The framework also defines a number of custom value types:

* xref:refguide:applib:index/value/Blob.adoc[Blob]
* xref:refguide:applib:index/value/Clob.adoc[Clob]
* xref:refguide:applib:index/value/Markup.adoc[Markup]
+
Rendered as HTML.

* xref:refguide:applib:index/value/Password.adoc[Password]
+
Holds a string whose value is suppressed in the UI.
+
CAUTION: Note that this string is unencrypted.

* xref:refguide:applib:index/value/LocalResourcePath.adoc[LocalResourcePath]
+
Represents a local resource relative to the application's context root (eg a servlet or controller).
+
Actions that return results of this type result in a browser redirect to the resource.
This is therefore a way to redirect to a custom controller.

* xref:refguide:applib:index/graph/tree/TreePath.adoc[TreePath] and xref:refguide:applib:index/graph/tree/TreeNode.adoc[TreeNode]
+
These can be used to render tree structures.

In addition, there are a number of non-core value types that can be brought in individually:

** xref:refguide:valuetypes:index/asciidoc/applib/value/AsciiDoc.adoc[]
+
Rendered as HTML.

** xref:refguide:valuetypes:index/markdown/applib/value/Markdown.adoc[]
+
Rendered as HTML.

** xref:refguide:valuetypes:index/vega/applib/value/Vega.adoc[]
+
Rendered as a dynamic graph.
Content is a graph as described using the link:https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/[Vega-lite] grammar.

More details of the above non-core value types can be found in the xref:valuetypes:ROOT:about.adoc[Value Types] catalog.

The core framework also defines a number of value types whose use is primarily internal:

* xref:refguide:applib:index/services/bookmark/Bookmark.adoc[Bookmark]
* anything supported by xref:refguide:applib:index/services/bookmark/IdStringifier.adoc[IdStringifier]
+
Used by the xref:userguide:commandlog:about.adoc[], xref:userguide:executionlog:about.adoc[], xref:userguide:executionoutbox:about.adoc[] and xref:security:sessionlog:about.adoc[] externsions modules so that their application primary keys of their corresponding entities are recognised as value types

* `ApplicationFeatureIdValueSemantics`

The xref:refguide:schema:about.adoc[] of XSDs define a number of DTOs (persisted by the above core extensions) which are also recognised as value types:

* xref:refguide:schema:cmd.adoc[CommandDto] (and an XML pretty-render variant)
* xref:refguide:schema:ixn.adoc[InteractionDto] (and an XML pretty-render variant)
* xref:refguide:schema:chg.adoc[ChangesDto] (and an XML pretty-render variant)



== Custom value types

It is also possible to write your own value types, either scalar or composite.
For more on this topic, see xref:userguide:ROOT:value-types.adoc#custom-value-types[custom value types] topic in the user guide.
