This section defines a number of "mixee" interfaces that define a contract for some framework-defined mixins.

[#java-lang-object]
== java.lang.Object

The framework provides a number of mixins that contributes to `java.lang.Object` (in other words, to every domain object):

* Layout
** xref:refguide:applib:index/mixins/layout/Object_downloadLayout.adoc[Object_downloadLayout]

* Metamodel
** xref:refguide:applib:index/mixins/metamodel/Object_downloadMetamodelXml.adoc[Object_downloadMetamodelXml]
** xref:refguide:applib:index/mixins/metamodel/Object_rebuildMetamodel.adoc[Object_rebuildMetamodel]
** xref:refguide:applib:index/mixins/metamodel/Object_logicalTypeName.adoc[Object_logicalTypeName] (property)
** xref:refguide:applib:index/mixins/metamodel/Object_objectIdentifier.adoc[Object_objectIdentifier] (property)

* Wicket viewer:
** xref:refguide:viewer:index/wicket/applib/mixins/Object_clearHints.adoc[Object_clearHints]

* All viewers:
** xref:refguide:viewer:index/commons/applib/mixins/Object_impersonate.adoc[Object_impersonate]
** xref:refguide:viewer:index/commons/applib/mixins/Object_impersonateWithRoles.adoc[Object_impersonateWithRoles]
** xref:refguide:applib:index/mixins/rest/Object_openRestApi.adoc[Object_openRestApi]





[[Dto]]
== Dto

JAXB view models can optionally implement the xref:refguide:applib:index/mixins/dto/Dto.adoc[Dto] interface.
Two mixins contribute to this interface:

* xref:refguide:applib:index/mixins/dto/Dto_downloadXml.adoc[Dto_downloadXml]
* xref:refguide:applib:index/mixins/dto/Dto_downloadXsd.adoc[Dto_downloadXsd]

These allow the view model/DTO to be seriailized, respectively, as XML and as the XSD schema for said XML.

== Security

Domain objects that are created, updated or otherwise associated with a user can implement the xref:refguide:applib:index/mixins/security/HasUsername.adoc[HasUsername] mixee interface.

A number of extension modules related to security, such as xref:security:secman:about.adoc[SecMan] module, contribute to this interface.


== System

Domain objects that are associated to an xref:refguide:applib:index/services/iactn/Interaction.adoc[Interaction] can express this relationship by implementing the xref:refguide:applib:index/mixins/system/HasInteractionId.adoc[HasInteractionId] interface.

Mixins that contribute to this mixee interface include:

* from the xref:userguide:commandlog:about.adoc[Command Log] extension:

** xref:refguide:extensions:index/commandlog/applib/contributions/Object_recentCommands.adoc[Object_recentCommands]
** xref:refguide:extensions:index/commandlog/applib/contributions/HasInteractionId_commandLogEntry.adoc[HasInteraction_commandLogEntry]
** xref:refguide:extensions:index/commandlog/applib/contributions/HasUsername_recentCommandsByUser.adoc[HasUsername_recentCommandsByUser]


* from the xref:userguide:executionlog:about.adoc[Execution Log] extension:

** xref:refguide:extensions:index/executionlog/applib/contributions/Object_recentExecutions.adoc[Object_recentExecutions]
** xref:refguide:extensions:index/executionlog/applib/contributions/HasInteractionId_executionLogEntries.adoc[HasInteractionId_executionLogEntries]

The closely related  xref:refguide:applib:index/mixins/system/HasInteractionIdAndSequence.adoc[HasInteractionIdAndSequence] (a subtype of xref:refguide:applib:index/mixins/system/HasInteractionId.adoc[HasInteractionId]) can be implemented by any objects representing events that could occur multiple times within within the outer xref:refguide:applib:index/services/iactn/Interaction.adoc[Interaction], most notably transactions..

The xref:refguide:applib:index/services/bookmark/HasTarget.adoc[HasTarget] is intended for domain objects representing commands, audit entries or executions (of action invocations/property edits).
Extension modules that provide these capabilities can implement this domain object to allow the user to navigate between these different but related cross-cutting concerns.

Mixins that contribute to this mixee interface include:

** xref:refguide:applib:index/mixins/system/HasTarget_openTargetObject.adoc[HasTarget_openTargetObject]
+
(provided by the core framework)




== Updates

The following interfaces define a contract for the framework to update:

* xref:refguide:applib:index/mixins/updates/OnUpdatedAt.adoc[OnUpdatedAt]
+
For domain entities that keep track of when they were last updated.

* xref:refguide:applib:index/mixins/updates/OnUpdatedBy.adoc[OnUpdatedBy]
+
For domain entities that keep track of which user last updated them.

* xref:refguide:applib:index/mixins/updates/OnUpdatedByAndAt.adoc[OnUpdatedByAndAt]
+
Simply a combination of xref:refguide:applib:index/mixins/updates/OnUpdatedAt.adoc[OnUpdatedAt] and xref:refguide:applib:index/mixins/updates/OnUpdatedBy.adoc[OnUpdatedBy]

Note that these are not quite the same thing as regular mixee interfaces, in that they do not expose getters to be leveraged by a mixin.
Rather, these expose callback such that the framework can populate them at the appropriate juncture.
