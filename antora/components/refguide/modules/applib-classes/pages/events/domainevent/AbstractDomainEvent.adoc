This class is the superclass for all domain events that are raised by the framework when interacting with actions, properties or collections.

Its immediate subclasses are:

* xref:applib-classes:events.adoc#ActionDomainEvent[ActionDomainEvent]
* xref:applib-classes:events.adoc#PropertyDomainEvent[PropertyDomainEvent]
* xref:applib-classes:events.adoc#CollectionDomainEvent[CollectionDomainEvent]

The main purpose of the class is to define the protocol by which subscribers can influence an interaction (eg hide a collection, disable a property, validate action arguments).
It class also provides a simple mechanism to allow adhoc sharing of user data between different phases.

== API

The API of the class is:

// TODO: v2: use include::[]

[source,java]
----
public abstract class AbstractDomainEvent<S> extends java.util.EventObject {

    public S getSource();                                           // <.>
    public Object getMixedIn();                                     // <.>
    public Object getSubject();                                     // <.>

    public Identifier getIdentifier();                              // <.>

    public Phase getEventPhase();                                   // <.>

    public void hide();                                             // <.>
    public boolean isHidden();                                      // <.>

    public void disable(final String reason);                       // <.>
    public void disable(final TranslatableString reason);
    public String getDisabledReason();                              // <.>
    public TranslatableString getDisabledReasonTranslatable();
    public boolean isDisabled();

    public void invalidate(final String reason);                    // <.>
    public void invalidate(final TranslatableString reason);
    public String getInvalidityReason();                            // <.>
    public TranslatableString getInvalidityReasonTranslatable();
    public boolean isInvalid();

    public void veto(final String reason, final Object... args);    // <.>
    public void veto(final TranslatableString translatableReason);

    public Object get(Object key);                                  // <.>
    public void put(Object key, Object value);
}
----

<.> The domain object raising this event.
+
For a "regular" action, property or collection then this will be the target domain object.
But for a "mixin" action, this will be an instance of the mixin itself.

<.> For a "mixin", this will be the target object that is being contributed to.
+
For a "regular" action, this will return `null`.

<.> Returns the domain object being interacted with, irrespective of whether this is a "regular" action/property/collection or a "mixin".
+
* For a regular member, this will return the same as `getSource()`.
+
* For a mixin, this will return the same as `getMixedIn()`.

<.> Identifier of the action, property or collection being interacted with.

<.> Whether the framework is checking visibility, enablement, validity or actually executing (invoking action, editing property), as per the `Phase` enum (defined below).

<.> API for subscribers to hide the member

<.> Used by the framework to determine if the member should be hidden (not rendered)

<.> API for subscribers to disable the member, specifying the reason why (possibly translated)

<.> Used by the framework to determine whether the member should be disabled (greyed out) when rendered.

<.> API for subscribers to invalidate an interaction, eg invalid arguments to an action

<.> Used by the framework to determine whether the interaction is invalid and should be blocked (eg pressing OK shows message)

<.> Convenience API for subscribers to veto; will automatically call either `hide()`, `disable(...)` or `invalidate(...)` based on the phase

<.> Mechanism to allow subscribers to share arbitrary information between phases.
One event instance is used for both the hide and disable phases, and a different event instance is shared between validate/pre-execute/post-execute.

The referenced `Phase` enum is in turn:

[source,java]
----
public enum Phase {
    HIDE,
    DISABLE,
    VALIDATE,
    EXECUTING,
    EXECUTED;
    public boolean isValidatingOrLater();    // <.>
}
----
<.> The significance being that at this point the proposed values/arguments are known, and so the event can be fully populated.
