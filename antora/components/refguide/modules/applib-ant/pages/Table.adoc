The `@Table` annotation is part of the Jakarta Persistence API (JPA) and is used to specify the primary table for a mapped entity.
By default, the table name is assumed to be the same as the entity name, but `@Table` allows customization of the table name and other table-level details.

Although this annotation is recognised by Causeway, its metadata is currently unused.

== Usage

Annotate your entity class with `@Table` to define the table mapping:

[source,java]
----
import jakarta.persistence.Entity;
import jakarta.persistence.Table;

@Entity
@Table(name = "customers")
public class Customer {
    // ...
}
----
