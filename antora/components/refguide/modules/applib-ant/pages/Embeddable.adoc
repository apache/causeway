The `@jakarta.persistence.Embeddable` is used by JPA to indicate that a class is persisted inline within a containing domain entity.

== Mutability

If the embeddable class is mutable, then the semantics are a dependent entity in 1:1 relationship with its containing domain entity.
In Apache Causeway, this should be modelled as a view model, and will be rendered in the UI as a reference (hyperlink) to the associated object.

If the embeddable class is immutable, then the semantics are closer to a composite value type.
In most cases the framework won't be able to render the object directly, but a representation of the object could be derived.
An example is xref:refguide:persistence:index/jpa/applib/types/BlobJpaEmbeddable.adoc[] and xref:refguide:persistence:index/jpa/applib/types/ClobJpaEmbeddable.adoc[], which persist the state for `Blob` and `Clob` respectively, and which provide convenient helpers to marshal between them.
Other value types could be represented using xref:refguide:valuetypes:index/asciidoc/applib/value/AsciiDoc.adoc[] or similar.

== Example

For example:

[source,java]
.PostalAddress.java
----
import jakarta.persistence.*;

@Embeddable                                         // <.>
@AllArgsConstructor
@Getter @Setter
public class PostalAddress {

    private String firstLine;
    private String secondLine;
    private String city;
    private String postalCode;
    private String country;

    public AsciiDoc toAsciiDoc() {                  // <.>
       // ...
    }

}
----
<.> Indicates that this is an embeddable object
<.> Returns a renderable representation of this object

This could then be used as so:

[source,java]
.Customer.java
----
import jakarta.persistence.*;

@Entity
public class Customer {

    @Embedded                                           // <.>
    private PostalAddress homeAddress;

    public AsciiDoc getHomeAddress() {                  // <.>
        return Optional.ofNullable(homeAddress)
                .map(CustomerAddress::toAsciiDoc)
                .orElse(null);
    }

    @Action(semantics = IDEMPOTENT)
    public Customer updateHomeAddress(                      // <.>
                String firstLine,
                String secondLine,
                String city,
                String postalCode,
                String country) {
        this.homeAddress = new PostalAddress(/*...*/);
        return this;
     }
}
----
<.> Indicates that the state of the referenced `PostalAddress` should be stored inline within the same table that stores the ``Customer``'s own data
<.> Renders the address using AsciiDoc
<.> Allows the state of the embedded object to be updated (or replaced).
