Apache Causeway' defaults for properties and parameters is that they are mandatory unless otherwise stated.
The `@javax.annotation.Nullable` annotation is recognized by Apache Causeway for both properties and parameters as means to indicate that the property/parameter is not mandatory.

For example:

[source,java]
----
@javax.annotation.Nullable
public String getName() {
    return name;
}
public void setName(final String name) {
    this.name = name;
}
----

or:

[source,java]
----
public Customer updateName(@javax.annotation.Nullable final String name) {
    setName(name);
    return this;
}
----

Apache Causeway does provide several other ways to specify optionality: using the
xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/Property.adoc#optionality[@Property#optionality()] /
xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/Parameter.adoc#optionality[@Parameter#optionality()] annotation.
For properties, the optionality can also be inferred from the JPA xref:refguide:applib-ant:Column.adoc#nullability[@Column#nullable()] attribute.

[TIP]
====
See the
xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/Property.adoc#optionality[@Property#optionality()] documentation for a much fuller discussion on the relationship between using the Apache Causeway annotations vs
xref:refguide:applib-ant:Column.adoc#nullability[@Column#nullable()].
====

If more than one method is specified then the framework will validate that there are no incompatibilities (and fail to boot otherwise).
