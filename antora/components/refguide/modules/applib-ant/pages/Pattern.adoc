The `@jakarta.validation.constraints.Pattern` annotation is recognized by Apache Causeway as a means to specify a regular expression constraint for properties and action parameters of type `java.lang.String`.

For example, here's the annotation being used on an action parameter:

[source,java]
----
import jakarta.validation.constraints.Pattern;

public Customer updateName(
        @Pattern(
            regexp="[A-Z].+",
            message="Must begin with a capital."
        )
        final String name) {
    setName(name);
    return this;
}
// ...
----

and here's an example of its use on a property:

[source,java]
----
import jakarta.validation.constraints.Pattern;

@Pattern(
    regexp="[A-Z].+",
    message="Must begin with a capital."
)
@Getter @Setter
private String name;
...
----
