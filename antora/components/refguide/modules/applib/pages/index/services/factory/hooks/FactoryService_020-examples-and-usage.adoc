== Usage

The benefits of using this method (instead of simply using the Java `new` keyword) are:

* any services will be injected into the object immediately (otherwise they will not be injected until the framework becomes aware of the object, typically when it is persisted through the xref:refguide:applib:index/services/repository/RepositoryService.adoc[`RepositoryService`]

* the default value for any properties (usually as specified by `defaultXxx()` supporting methods) or from the value type itself will be set and the `created()` callback will be called.

An alternative idiom is to just `new` up the object and then use xref:refguide:applib:index/services/inject/ServiceInjector.adoc[ServiceInjector] domain service can be used to inject services into the domain object.
Note though that no default values will be set on the created object.


== Example

For example:

[source,java]
----
Customer cust = factoryService.detachedEntity(Customer.class);
cust.setFirstName("Freddie");
cust.setLastName("Mercury");
repositoryService.persist(cust);
----

* The xref:refguide:applib:index/services/repository/RepositoryService.adoc[RepositoryService] is often used in conjunction with the `FactoryService`, to persist domain objects after they have been instantiated and populated.
