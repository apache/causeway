== Usage


The primary use case is to lookup domain services programmatically (as an alternative to injection).

For example:

.Service Lookup (Optional)
[source,java]
----
Optional<MyService> myServiceIfAny = serviceRegistry.lookupService(MyService.class);
----

.Service Lookup (enforced non-null)
[source,java]
----
MyService myService = serviceRegistry.lookupServiceElseFail(MyService.class);
----
