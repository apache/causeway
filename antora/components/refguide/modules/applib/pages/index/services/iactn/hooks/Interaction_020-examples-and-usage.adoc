== Usage Notes

You could also think of this interface as somewhat analogous to a (database) transaction.
However, the framework's xref:refguide:applib:index/services/xactn/TransactionService.adoc[TransactionService] allows programmatic control of underlying database transactions, including the ability to commit one transaction and start a new one (using xref:refguide:applib:index/services/xactn/TransactionService.adoc#nextTransaction[nextTransaction]).
The is therefore not an exact mapping between an `Interaction` and a (database) transaction, because the former could span multiple of the latter.
