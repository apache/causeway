== Usage Notes

Not all of the REST API exposed by the xref:vro:ROOT:about.adoc[Restful Objects viewer] is included in the Swagger schema definition files; the emphasis is those REST resources that are used to develop custom apps: domain objects, domain object collections and action invocations.

When combined with Apache Isis' own xref:vro:ROOT:simplified-representations.adoc[simplified representations], these are pretty much all that is needed  for this use case.


The service is_not_ (currently) used by the framework itself; it is provided as a convenience for developers to build REST applications.
