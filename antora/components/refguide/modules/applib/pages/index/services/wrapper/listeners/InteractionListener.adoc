== Members

[#objectTitleRead__ObjectTitleEvent]
=== objectTitleRead(ObjectTitleEvent)

The title was read.

[#objectPersisted__ObjectValidityEvent]
=== objectPersisted(ObjectValidityEvent)

The object was persisted (or an attempt to persist it was made).

[#propertyVisible__PropertyVisibilityEvent]
=== propertyVisible(PropertyVisibilityEvent)

A check was made to determine if a property was visible.

[#propertyUsable__PropertyUsabilityEvent]
=== propertyUsable(PropertyUsabilityEvent)

A check was made to determine if a property was usable.

[#propertyAccessed__PropertyAccessEvent]
=== propertyAccessed(PropertyAccessEvent)

A property was read.

Unlike most other events, a xref:refguide:applib:index/services/wrapper/events/PropertyAccessEvent.adoc[PropertyAccessEvent] will never have been vetoed (that is, _PropertyAccessEvent#isVeto()_ will always be `false` ).

[#propertyModified__PropertyModifyEvent]
=== propertyModified(PropertyModifyEvent)

A property was modified (or an attempt to modify it was made)

Use _PropertyModifyEvent#getProposed()_ to determine whether the property was being set or cleared.

[#collectionVisible__CollectionVisibilityEvent]
=== collectionVisible(CollectionVisibilityEvent)

A check was made to determine if a collection was visible.

Will be fired prior to _#collectionUsable(CollectionUsabilityEvent)_ .

[#collectionUsable__CollectionUsabilityEvent]
=== collectionUsable(CollectionUsabilityEvent)

A check was made to determine if a collection was usable.

Will be fired prior to either _#collectionAccessed(CollectionAccessEvent)_ or _#collectionAddedTo(CollectionAddToEvent)_ or _#collectionRemovedFrom(CollectionRemoveFromEvent)_ .

[#collectionAccessed__CollectionAccessEvent]
=== collectionAccessed(CollectionAccessEvent)

A collection was read.

Unlike most other events, a xref:refguide:applib:index/services/wrapper/events/CollectionAccessEvent.adoc[CollectionAccessEvent] will never have been vetoed (that is, _CollectionAccessEvent#isVeto()_ will always be `false` ).

[#collectionAddedTo__CollectionAddToEvent]
=== collectionAddedTo(CollectionAddToEvent)

An object was added to the collection (or an attempt to add it was made).

[#collectionRemovedFrom__CollectionRemoveFromEvent]
=== collectionRemovedFrom(CollectionRemoveFromEvent)

An object was removed from the collection (or an attempt to remove it was made).

[#collectionMethodInvoked__CollectionMethodEvent]
=== collectionMethodInvoked(CollectionMethodEvent)

A method of a collection (such as `isEmpty()` or `size()` ) has been invoked.

Unlike the other methods in this interface, the source of these events will be an instance of a Collection (such as `java.util.List` ) rather than the domain object. (The domain object is _CollectionMethodEvent#getDomainObject()_ still available, however).

[#actionVisible__ActionVisibilityEvent]
=== actionVisible(ActionVisibilityEvent)

A check was made to determine if an action was visible.

Will be fired prior to _#actionUsable(ActionUsabilityEvent)_ .

[#actionUsable__ActionUsabilityEvent]
=== actionUsable(ActionUsabilityEvent)

A check was made to determine if an action was usable.

Will be fired prior to _#actionArgument(ActionArgumentEvent)_ .

[#actionArgument__ActionArgumentEvent]
=== actionArgument(ActionArgumentEvent)

A check was made as to whether an argument proposed for an action was valid.

Will be fired prior to _#actionInvoked(ActionInvocationEvent)_ .

[#actionInvoked__ActionInvocationEvent]
=== actionInvoked(ActionInvocationEvent)

An action was invoked (or an attempt to invoke it was made).
