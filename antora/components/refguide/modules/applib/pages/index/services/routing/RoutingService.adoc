Provides the ability to return (and therefore have rendered) an alternative object from an action invocation.

There are two primary use cases:

* if an action returns an aggregate leaf (that is, a child object which has an owning parent), then the parent object can be * returned instead.
+
--
For example, an action returning `OrderItem` might instead render the owning `Order` object. It is the responsibility of the implementation to figure out what the "owning" object might be.
--
* if an action returns `null` or is `void`, then return some other "useful" object.
+
--
For example, return the home page (eg as defined by the _org.apache.isis.applib.annotation.HomePage_ annotation).

Currently this service is used only by the Wicket viewer; it is ignored by the Restful Objects viewer.

--
whether this implementation recognizes and can "route" the object.

The object to route to instead; this may be the same as the original object, some other object, or (indeed) `null`.
