The `addTo...()` supporting method is called whenever an object is added to a collection. Its purpose is to allow additional business logic to be performed.


[NOTE]
====
Directly mutable collections are not currently supported by the xref:vw:ROOT:about.adoc[Wicket viewer].  The suggested workaround is to simply define an action.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class LibraryMember {
    public SortedSet<Book> getBorrowed() { /* ... */ }
    public void setBorrowed(SortedSet<Book> borrowed) { /* ... */ }
    public void addToBorrowed(Book book) {
        getBorrowed().add(book);                                              // <1>
        reminderService.addReminder(this, book, clock.today().plusDays(21));  // <2>
    }
    public void removeFromBorrowed(Book book) { /* ... */ }
    ...
}
----
<1> update the collection
<2> perform some additional business logic
