link:http://www.datanucleus.org/[DataNucleus] is the reference implementation of the JDO (Java data objects) spec, and Apache Isis integrates with DataNucleus as its persistence layer.
Datanucleus is a very powerful library, allowing domain entities to be mapped not only to relational database tables, but also to NoSQL stores such as link:http://neo4j.com/[Neo4J], link:http://www.mongodb.org/[MongoDB] and link:http://cassandra.apache.org/[Apache Cassandra].

With such power comes a little bit of complexity to the development environment: all domain entities must be enhanced through the DataNucleus enhancer.

[NOTE]
====
Bytecode enhancement is actually a requirement of the JDO spec; the process is described in outline http://db.apache.org/jdo/enhancement.html[here].
====

What this means is that the enhancer -- available as both a Maven plugin and as an Eclipse plugin -- must, one way or another, be integrated into your development environment.

If working from the Maven command line, JDO enhancement is done using the `datanucleus-maven-plugin`.

Both the xref:starters:helloworld:about.adoc[HelloWorld] and xref:starters:simpleapp:about.adoc[SimpleApp] starter apps have this plugin pre-configured.



== META-INF/persistence.xml

It's also a good idea to ensure that every domain module(s) containing entities has a JDO `META-INF/persistence.xml` file:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
<persistence xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/persistence"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/persistence http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/persistence/persistence_1_0.xsd" version="1.0">

    <persistence-unit name="simple"> <!--1-->
    </persistence-unit>
</persistence>
----
<1> change as required; typically is the name of the domain module.

Again, the xref:starters:helloworld:about.adoc[HelloWorld] and xref:starters:simpleapp:about.adoc[Simpleapp] starter apps do this.


[WARNING]
====
If running on Windows, then there's a good chance you'll hit the http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa365247%28VS.85%29.aspx#maxpath[maximum path length limit].
In this case the `persistence.xml` file is mandatory rather than optional.

This file is also required if you are using developing in Eclipse and relying on the DataNucleus plugin for Eclipse rather than the DataNucleus plugin for Maven.
More information can be found xref:setupguide:ROOT:eclipse.adoc[here].
