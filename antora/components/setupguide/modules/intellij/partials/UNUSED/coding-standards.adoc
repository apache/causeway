CAUTION: seem to have mislaid this file... would need verifying/updating anyway, I think.

Next, we suggest you import settings for standard ASF/Apache Causeway coding conventions.
This file is also provided as a settings file, namely *link:{attachmentsdir}/intellij/causeway-settings-code-style.jar[causeway-settings-code-style.jar]*.
Download and import (as for the above settings JAR files).
