This section describes how to install and setup JetBrains' IntelliJ IDEA, then how to import an application into IntelliJ and run it.

NOTE: This material does not constitute an endorsement; JetBrains is not affiliated to Apache Software Foundation in any way.
JetBrains does however provide complimentary copies of the IntelliJ IDE to Apache committers.


== Installing and Importing

This section covers installation and setup.
These notes/screenshots were prepared using IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition 2019.3, but is believed to be compatible with more recent versions/other editions of the IDE.

=== Download and Install

https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/[Download] latest version of IntelliJ Community Edition, and install.


=== Import Project

In IntelliJ a project can contain multiple modules; these need not be physically located together.

Download either the xref:docs:starters:helloworld.adoc[HelloWorld] or xref:docs:starters:simpleapp.adoc[SimpleApp] starter app to your filesystem.

From the welcome screen, select "import project":

image::015-import-project/010-welcome.png[width="400px"]

Navigate to the top-level pom.xml of the starter app:

image::015-import-project/020-import-pom.png[width="300px"]

Project imported:

image::015-import-project/030-imported.png[width="800px"]
Start off by creating a new project:


Use menu:File[Project Structure] to confirm that JDK 8 is configured:

image::015-import-project/040-project-structure.png[width="600px"]



== Configuring

//include::partial$UNUSED/file-templates.adoc[leveloffset=+2]
//include::partial$UNUSED/live-templates.adoc[leveloffset=+2]
//include::partial$UNUSED/coding-standards.adoc[leveloffset=+2]

=== Compiler Settings

There are a number of compiler settings that influence the compiler.
We highly recommend you set these.

On the *Compiler* Settings page, ensure that `build automatically` is enabled (and optionally `compile independent modules in parallel`):

.IntelliJ Compiler Settings
image::040-other-settings-compiler/010-build-automatically.png[width="700px"]


On the *Annotation Processors* page, confirm that these are enabled for all of the `packaging=jar` modules (in other words, those that contain Java and have a `src/main/java` directory):

.IntelliJ Annotation Processor Settings
image::040-other-settings-compiler/020-annotation-processor.png[width="700px"]

This setting enables the generation of the `Q*` classes for DataNucleus type-safe queries, as well as being required for frameworks such as xref:setupguide:ROOT:hints-and-tips.adoc#project-lombok[Project Lombok].


=== Maven Settings

There are also some other settings for Maven that we recommend you adjust (though these are less critical):

On the Maven settings page:

.IntelliJ Maven Settings - Installation
image::042-other-settings-maven/010-maven-installation.png[width="700px"]

Still on the Maven settings page, configure as follows:

.IntelliJ Maven Settings - Configuration
image::042-other-settings-maven/020-maven-configuration.png[width="700px"]

=== Editor Settings

On the *Auto Import* settings page, check the `optimize imports on the fly` and `add unambiguous imports on the fly`

.IntelliJ Auto Import Setting
image::044-other-settings-misc/010-auto-import.png[width="700px"]

You might also want to exclude certain packages or classes from auto-import, for example:

* `java.awt.*`
* `javax.swing.*`
* `lombok.experimental.*`

== Plugins

You might want to set up some additional plugins.
You can do this using `File > Settings > Plugins` (or equivalently `File > Other Settings > Configure Plugins`).

Highly recommended are:

* link:https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7179?pr=idea[Maven Helper] plugin

* link:https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7391-asciidoc[AsciiDoctor] plugin
+
Extremely useful if you are doing any authoring of documents (plugin's git repo is link:https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-intellij-plugin[here])

* link:https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6317-lombok[Lombok] plugin
+
If you plan to use link:https://projectlombok.org[Project Lombok] to reduce boilerplate.




== Running

Let's see how to run both the app and the tests.

We run the application by creating a Run configuration, using `Run > Edit Configurations`.

There is one complication, which is the ORM.
If the app uses xref:pjpa:ROOT:about.adoc[JPA], then dynamic class weaving should be configured.
If the app uses xref:pjdo:ROOT:about.adoc[JDO], then Datanucleus enhancer should be configured.


=== Running the App (JPA)

CAUTION: TODO - to document

=== Running the App (JDO)

DataNucleus requires that all entities are bytecode enhanced.
When building from the command line using Maven, the `datanucleus:enhance` Maven plugin takes care of this.

We can just have IntelliJ run the enhance as a separate run configuration before the run configuration that runs the app itself.

First, set up the run configuration to do the enhance:

.Run Configuration to enhance the entities
image::110-running-the-app/005-datanucleus-enhance-run-configuration.png[width="700px"]

TIP: Check "work offline" (on the General tab) to speed this up slightly.

[WARNING]
====
If on Windows you encounter a "The command line is too long" error, then set '-Dfork=false' as a VM option (on the Runner tab).
====

Then, set up the run configuration for the app.
Note how it runs the enhance configuration first:

.Run Configuration to run the app
image::110-running-the-app/010-run-configuration.png[width="700px"]

You should now be able to run the app using `Run > Run Configuration`.
The same configuration can also be used to debug the app if you so need.


.Dynamic Enhancement ?
[sidebar]
****
Rather than statically enhancing the classes, an alternative -- at least in theory -- is to enhance the classes dynamically, at runtime.

This plugin (not tested) purports to support this: link:https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/11119-datanucleus-runtime-enhancement[].
****


=== Running the Unit Tests

The easiest way to run the unit tests is just to right click on the relevant package in the _Project Window_, and choose run unit tests.
Hopefully your tests will pass (!).

.Running Unit Tests from Project Explorer
image::110-running-the-app/030-running-unit-tests.png[width="300px"]

As a side-effect, this will create a run configuration, very similar to the one we manually created for the main app:

.Unit Tests Run Configuration
image::110-running-the-app/040-running-unit-tests-run-configuration.png[width="700px"]

Thereafter, you should run units by selecting this configuration (if you use the right click approach you'll end up with lots of run configurations, all similar).

=== Running the Integration Tests

Integration tests can be run in the same way as unit tests.

One approach is to initially run the tests use the right click on the `integtests` module:

.Running Integ Tests from Project Explorer
image::110-running-the-app/045-running-integ-tests.png[width="400px"]


If the app uses JDO, then the tests might fail because the entities won't have been enhanced.
However, we can then easily update the run configuration to run the datanucleus enhancer goal (same as when running the application):

.Integration Tests Run Configuration
image::110-running-the-app/050-running-integration-tests-run-configuration.png[width="700px"]


CAUTION: Make sure that the `search for tests` radio button is set to `In single module`.
If this radio button is set to one of the other options then you may obtain class loading issues.
