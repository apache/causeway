The process for merging in github pull requests (so that they can be tested locally before committing) has been scripted in the `github-pr.sh` script.

The script will merge the fork into a temporary branch, and then run a build.  Once you are happy, you can commit.





== Process and Usage

The overall process is as follows:

* locate/raise corresponding JIRA ticket, eg ISIS-1162
* checkout branch from which PR was forked (usually just 'master')
* merge PR into temporary branch using the `github-pr.sh` script
* test the change locally (run the app, rebuild, manual regression tests etc)
* if required, tidy up/refactor code as required
* merge temporary branch into mainline, and commit

This link:https://youtu.be/CKSLZBBHjME[screencast] also shows the process.


== Prerequisites

The script uses 'jq' to parse JSON.  To install:

* on Linux: +
+
[source,bash]
----
aptitude install jq
----

* on MacOS: +
+
[source,bash]
----
brew install jq
----

* on Windows: +
+
Download exe from http://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/[website]



== Syntax

The syntax is:

[source,bash]
----
github-pr.sh -j 1162 -g 31 [-s] [-p ISIS]
----

where:

* `-j 1162` +
+
is the JIRA ticket number

* `-g 31`   +
+
is the github PR issue number

* `-s` +
+
will optionally skip the build and auto-merge

* `-p ISIS` +
+
optionally overrids the JIRA project (defaults to 'ISIS')



== Example transcript

The listing below shows the steps taken by the script:

[source,bash]
----
$ sh github-pr.sh isis 1162 31

Found JIRA ticket
Found github PR
branch_name_local: master
username         : sebadiaz
repo_full_name   : sebadiaz/isis
repo_clone_url   : https://github.com/sebadiaz/isis.git
branch_name_fork : master

merging into: ISIS-1162_pr-31

Merged the PR; hit enter to build
----

The build now commences.  Once done, the script continues:

[source,bash]
----
If build successful and happy to merge, execute:

git checkout master && git merge --no-ff ISIS-1162_pr-31 && git branch -d ISIS-1162_pr-31
----

The screenshot belows shows the history we end up with:

image::committers/github-pr-history.png[link="{imagesdir}/committers/github-pr-history.png"]

This shows the fork being merged into the temporary branch ("ISIS-1162_pr-31"), then some further tidy-up, and finally the merging of the temporary branch into mainline.

Note that there is no rebasing in this model.  This is intentional: when the merged branch is pushed, github will automatically close the original pull request.
