[[__dg_building-isis_git]]
== Git

The Apache Isis source code lives in a git repo.


[[__dg_building-isis_git_installation]]
=== Installation

The easiest place to get hold of command-line git is probably the http://git-scm.com/downloads[github download page].

On Windows, this also installs the rather good mSysGit Unix shell. We recommend that you enable git for both the mSysgit and the Windows command prompt:

image::building-isis/setting-up-git.png[width="350px",link="{imagesdir}building-isis/setting-up-git.png"]

Once git is installed, the two main command line tools to note are:

* `git` command line tool
* `gitk` for viewing the commit history

If using Windows, note that github also have a dedicated https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git[Windows client]. With a little http://haacked.com/archive/2012/05/30/using-github-for-windows-with-non-github-repositories.aspx[hacking around], it can also be made to work with non-github repositories.

If using Mac, you might also want to check out Atlassian's http://www.atlassian.com/software/sourcetree/overview[Sourcetree].



[[__dg_building-isis_git_installation_cloning-the-apache-isis-repo]]
==== Cloning the Apache Isis repo

First, clone the Apache Isis repo:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/apache/isis.git
----


[[__dg_building-isis_git_installation_configuring-git]]
==== Configuring Git

Next up is to configure your user name and password:

[source,bash]
----
git config user.name "<i>My Name Here</i>"
git config user.email <i>myusername@apache.org</i>
----

Next, configure the `core.autocrlf` so that line endings are normalized to LF (Unix style) in the rep; again see https://git-wip-us.apache.org/[Apache's git] page:


* on Windows, use: +
+
[source,bash]
----
git config core.autocrlf true
----

* on Mac/Linux, use: +
+
[source,bash]
----
git config core.autocrlf input
----


The Windows setting means that files are converted back to CRLF on checkout; the Mac/Linux setting means that the file is left as LF on checkout.

We also recommend setting `core.safecrlf`, which aims to ensure that any line ending conversion is repeatable. Do this on all platforms:

[source,bash]
----
git config core.safecrlf true
----


Note that these settings are supplemented in the repo by the `.gitattributes` file and that explicitly specifies line handling treatment for most of the common file types that we have.

Next, we recommend you setup this a refspec so that you can distinguish remote tags from local ones. To do that, locate the `[remote &quot;origin&quot;]` section in your `.git/config` and add the third entry shown below:


[source,bash]
----
[remote "origin"]
    url = ... whatever ...
    fetch = ... whatever ...
    fetch = +refs/tags/*:refs/tags/origin/*
----


This will ensure that a `git fetch` or `git pull` places any remote tags under `origin/xxx.  For example, the`isis-1.0.0`tag on the origin will appear under`origin/isis-1.0.0`.


If you don't use git outside of Apache, you can add the `--global` flag so that the above settings apply for all repos managed by git on your PC.



[[__dg_building-isis_git_getting-help]]
=== Getting help

Three commands of git that in particular worth knowing:

* `git help _command_` +
+
will open the man page in your web browser

* `git gui` +
+
will open up a basic GUI client to staging changes and making commits.

* `gitk --all` +
+
will open the commit history for all branches. In particular, you should be able to see the local `master`, which branch you are working on (the `HEAD`), and also the last known position of the `master` branch from the central repo, called `origin/master`.

You might also want to explore using a freely available equivalent such as link:https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/[Atlassian SourceTree].

[[__dg_building-isis_installing-java]]
== Installing Java

Apache Isis is compatible with Java 7 and Java 8.  For every-day use, the framework is usually compiled against Java 8.

Releases however are xref:support:cgcom:cgcom.adoc#_cgcom_cutting-a-release[cut] using Java 7, leveraging the link:http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-toolchains-plugin/[Maven toolchains plugin]).

Therefore install either/both of Java 7 JDK and Java 8 JDK.  Note that the JRE is _not_ sufficient.

[TIP]
====
If you intend to contribute back patches to Apache Isis, note that while you can develop using Java 8 within your IDE,
be sure not to use any Java 8 APIs.
====

[[__dg_building-isis_configure-maven-toolchains-plugin]]
=== Configure Maven toolchains plugin

If you are a committer that will be performing releases of Apache Isis, then you _must_ configure the
link:http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-toolchains-plugin/[toolchains] plugin so that releases can be built using
Java 7.

This is done by placing the `toolchains.xml` file in `~/.m2` directory.  Use the following file as a template,
adjusting paths for your platform:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF8"?>
<toolchains>
    <toolchain>
        <type>jdk</type>
        <provides>
            <version>1.8</version>
            <vendor>oracle</vendor>
        </provides>
        <configuration>
            <jdkHome>/usr/lib64/jvm/jdk1.8.0_65</jdkHome>
            <!--
            <jdkHome>c:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_65</jdkHome>
            -->
        </configuration>
    </toolchain>
    <toolchain>
        <type>jdk</type>
        <provides>
            <version>1.7</version>   <!--1-->
            <vendor>oracle</vendor>
        </provides>
        <configuration>
            <jdkHome>/usr/lib64/jvm/jdk1.7.0_79</jdkHome>
            <!--
            <jdkHome>c:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_79</jdkHome>
            -->
        </configuration>
    </toolchain>
</toolchains>
----
<1> The Apache Isis build is configured to search for the (`1.7, oracle`) JDK toolchain.

The Apache Isis parent `pom.xml` activates this plugin whenever the `apache-release` profile is enabled.




[[__dg_building-isis_installing-maven]]
== Installing Maven

Install Maven 3.0.x, downloadable http://maven.apache.org/download.html[here].

Set `MAVEN_OPTS` environment variable:

[source,bash]
----
export MAVEN_OPTS="-Xms512m -Xmx1024m"
----




[[__dg_building-isis_building-all-of-apache-isis]]
== Building all of Apache Isis

To build the source code from the command line, simply go to the root directory and type:

[source,bash]
----
mvn clean install
----


The first time you do this, you'll find it takes a while since Maven needs to download all of the Apache Isis prerequisites.

Thereafter you can speed up the build by adding the `-o` (offline flag).  To save more time still, we also recommend that you build in parallel.  (Per this link:http://zeroturnaround.com/rebellabs/your-maven-build-is-slow-speed-it-up/[blog post]), you could also experiment with a number of JDK parameters that we've found also speed up Maven:

[source,bash]
----
export MAVEN_OPTS="-Xms512m -Xmx1024m -XX:+TieredCompilation -XX:TieredStopAtLevel=1"
mvn clean install -o -T1C
----

For the most part, though, you may want to rely on an IDE such as Eclipse to build the codebase for you. Both Eclipse and Idea (12.0+) support incremental background compilation.

When using Eclipse, a Maven profile is configured such that Eclipse compiles to `target-ide` directory rather than the usual `target` directory. You can therefore switch between Eclipse and Maven command line without one interfering with the other.



[[__dg_building-isis_checking-for-vulnerabilities]]
== Checking for Vulnerabilities

Apache Isis configures the link:https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Main_Page[OWASP] link:https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Dependency_Check[dependency check] link:http://jeremylong.github.io/DependencyCheck/dependency-check-maven/index.html[Maven plugin] to determine whether the framework uses libraries that are known to have security vulnerabilities.

To check, run:

[source,bash]
----
mvn org.owasp:dependency-check-maven:aggregate -Dowasp
----

This will generate a single report under `target/dependency-check-report.html`.


[NOTE]
====
The first time this runs can take 10~20 minutes to download the NVD data feeds.
====

To disable, either run in offline mode (add `-o` or `--offline`) or omit the `owasp` property.



[[__dg_building-isis_checking-for-use-of-internal-jdk-apis]]
== Checking for use of internal JDK APIs

Apache Isis configures the link:https://maven.apache.org/plugins-archives/maven-jdeps-plugin-3.0.0/[jdeps maven plugin] to check for any usage of internal JDK APIs.  This is in preparation for Java 9 module system (Jigsaw) which will prevent such usage of APIs.

To check, run:

[source,bash]
----
mvn clean install -Djdeps
----

This will fail the build on any module that currently uses an internal JDK API.


[WARNING]
====
At the time of writing the `isis-core-schema` module fails the build.
