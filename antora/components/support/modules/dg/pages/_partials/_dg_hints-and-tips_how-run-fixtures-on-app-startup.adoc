From this link:http://isis.markmail.org/thread/g6amfj2eyf2xfjbr[thread] on the Apache Isis users mailing list:

* _my fixtures have grown into a couple of files the application needs to read in when it starts the first time (and possibly later on when the files content change).
What is the right way to do this?
Hook up into the webapp start?
Use events?_


The standard approach is to use xref:ug:tst:fixture-scripts.adoc[fixture scripts].
These can be run in on start-up typically by being specified in the xref:rg:cms:classes/AppManifest-bootstrapping.adoc[`AppManifest`], see for example the xref:ug:fun:getting-started/simpleapp-archetype.adoc[SimpleApp archetype].

Alternatively just set `isis.fixtures` and `isis.persistor.datanucleus.install-fixtures` properties.

In terms of implementations, you might also want to check out the (non-ASF) link:http://platform.incode.org[Incode Platform^]'s excel module, by using `ExcelFixture` and overriding `ExcelFixtureRowHandler`.

An example can be found in this (non ASF) link:https://github.com/incodehq/contactapp[contactapp], see link:https://github.com/incodehq/contactapp/blob/master/backend/fixture/src/main/java/org/incode/eurocommercial/contactapp/fixture/scenarios/demo/ContactImport.java[`ContactRowHandler`].
