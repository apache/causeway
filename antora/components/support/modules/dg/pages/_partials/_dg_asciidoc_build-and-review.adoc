To (re)build the documentation locally prior to release, change into the `adocs/documentation` directory and use:

[source]
----
mvn clean compile
----

The site will be generated at `target/site/index.html`.

You could then use a web server such as Python's SimpleHTTPServer to preview (so that all Javascript works correctly). However, instead we recommend using instant preview, described next.
