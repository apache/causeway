== Headings

The number of preceding `=` signs indicates the heading level.

[cols="3a,2a", options="header"]
|===

| Syntax
| Meaning

|....
= Level 1
....

|There can only be one level 1 per .adoc (at the very top).

The paragraph immediately following the heading is the "preamble", and is rendered in a larger font.
It's therefore a good place to summarize the content of the document.

|....
== Level 2
....

|Level 2

|....
=== Level 3
....

|Level 3

|....
==== Level 4
....
|Level 4

|===


== Paragraphs

[cols="3a,2a", options="header"]
|===

| Syntax
| Example

|....
Paragraphs are separated by one or more blank lines.

So, this is a separate paragraph.
....

|Paragraphs are separated by one or more blank lines.

So, this is a separate paragraph.


|....
All consecutive sentences are rendered in the same paragraph.
This is another sentence in the para.
And another one.
Yet another.
....

|Sentences without a blank line are in the same paragraph.
Don't worry about word wrapping, just start the next sentence on the next line.

|===


In general, there's no need to indent paragraphs; keep things left-aligned.
Let the markup specify the logical indentation.

.Start each sentence on a new line
****
Don't worry about wrapping sentences at 80 characters, just start each new sentence on a new line.
Asciidoc will take care of the rendering.

This simple tip has a number of other benefits:

1. when the document is edited (eg correct a typo or insert a missing word), then only a single line in the file is changed. +
+
This will reduce change of merge conflicts, too.

2. You can easily see if a sentence is too long, and should be split

3. You can easily see if all sentences are the same length: good writing should vary the length of sentences

4. You can easily see if successive sentences start with the same phrase (that might be a good thing, or a bad thing, depending).

****


== Bulleted lists

[cols="3a,2a", options="header"]
|===

| Syntax
| Example

|....
The blank line after this para is required:

* Bullet 1 +
+
Indented paragraph (note the '+' to to chain this para with the bullet)

* Bullet 2

** Child bullets +
+
More indenting

** Another child bullet

* Bullet 3
....

|The blank line after this para is required:

* Bullet 1 +
+
Indented paragraph (note the '+' to chain this para with the bullet)

* Bullet 2

** Child bullets +
+
More indenting

** Another child bullet

* Bullet 3

|===


== Numbered lists

There's no need to keep track of numbers, just use '1' or 'a' etc:

[cols="3a,2a", options="header"]
|===

| Syntax
| Example

|....
The blank line after this para is required:

1. Bullet 1 +
+
Indented paragraph

2. Bullet 2

a. Child bullets +
+
More indenting

b. Another child bullet

3. Bullet 3
....

|The blank line after this para is required:

1. Bullet 1 +
+
Indented paragraph

2. Bullet 2

a. Child bullets +
+
More indenting

b. Another child bullet

3. Bullet 3

|===

While it isn't necessary to maintain the ordering manually (could just use '1' for all bullets), this does generate warnings when the document is built.


== Links and Cross-references

[cols="3a,2a,3a", options="header"]
|===

| Syntax
| Example
| Purpose

|....
link:http://ciserver:8080[CI Server]
....
|link:http://ciserver:8080[CI Server]
|Link to an external hyperlink

|....
link:http://ciserver:8080[CI Server^]
....
|link:http://ciserver:8080[CI Server^]
|Link to an external hyperlink, with `target=blank`

|....
xref:dg.adoc#__dg_asciidoc_links-and-xrefs#[background]
....
|xref:dg.adoc#__dg_asciidoc_links-and-xrefs[background]
|Cross-reference to section in same asciidoc document

|....
xref:ug:fun:ugfun.adoc#[Fundamentals]
....
|xref:ug:fun:ugfun.adoc#[Fundamentals]
|Cross-reference to top-level of different asciidoc document

|....
xref:ug:fun:ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_core-concepts[Core Concepts]
....
|xref:ug:fun:ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_core-concepts[Core Concepts]
|Cross-reference to section within different asciidoc document

|===



== Tables

....
.Some table
[cols="3a,2a", options="header"]
|===

| Header col 1
| Header col 2

| Row 1 col 1
| Row 1 col 2

| Row 2 col 1
| Row 2 col 2

|===
....

renders as:

.Some table
[cols="3a,2a", options="header"]
|===

| Header col 1
| Header col 2

| Row 1 col 1
| Row 1 col 2

| Row 2 col 1
| Row 2 col 2

|===

where:

* the `cols` attribute says how many columns there are and their respective widths.
* the "a" suffix indicates that the contents is parsed as Asciidoc

=== Column Attributes

Other options are (link:http://mrhaki.blogspot.co.uk/2014/11/awesome-asciidoctor-styling-columns-and.html[credit]):

* e: emphasized
* a: Asciidoc markup
* m: monospace
* h: header style, all column values are styled as header
* s: strong
* l: literal, text is shown in monospace font and line breaks are kept
* d: default
* v: verse, keeps line breaks

For example:

....
.Table with column style e,a,m
[cols="e,a,m"]
|===
| Emphasized (e) | Asciidoc (a) | Monospaced (m)

| Asciidoctor
| NOTE: *Awesome* way to write documentation
| It is just code

|===
....

renders as

.Table with column style e,a,m
[cols="e,a,m"]
|===
| Emphasized (e) | Asciidoc (a) | Monospaced (m)

| Asciidoctor
| NOTE: *Awesome* way to write documentation
| It is just code

|===

and:

....
.Table with column style h,s,l
[cols="h,s,l"]
|===
| Header (h) | Strong (s) | Literal (l)

| Asciidoctor
| Awesome way to write documentation
| It is
just code

|===
....

renders as

.Table with column style h,s,l
[cols="h,s,l"]
|===
| Header (h) | Strong (s) | Literal (l)

| Asciidoctor
| Awesome way to write documentation
| It is
just code

|===

and:

....
.Table with column style d,v
[cols="d,v"]
|===
| Default (d) | Verse (v)

| Asciidoctor
| Awesome way
to write
documentation

|===
....

renders as

.Table with column style d,v
[cols="d,v"]
|===
| Default (d) | Verse (v)

| Asciidoctor
| Awesome way
to write
documentation

|===


=== Column Alignment

This can be combined with alignment markers (link:http://mrhaki.blogspot.co.uk/2014/11/awesome-asciidoctor-table-column-and.html[credit]):

* <: top align values (default)
* >: bottom align values
* ^: center values

For example:

....
[cols="^.>,<.<,>.^", options="header"]
|===

| Name
| Description
| Version

| Asciidoctor
| Awesome way to write documentation
| 1.5.0
|===
....

renders as:

[cols="^.>,<.<,>.^", options="header"]
|===

| Name
| Description
| Version

| Asciidoctor
| Awesome way to write documentation
| 1.5.0
|===

where:

* the first column is centered and bottom aligned,
* the second column is left and top aligned and
* the third column is right aligned and centered vertically.


=== Column/Row Spanning

We can also have columns or rows spanning multiple cells (link:http://mrhaki.blogspot.co.uk/2014/12/awesome-asciidoctor-span-cell-over-rows.html[credit]):

For example:

....
.Cell spans columns
|===
| Name | Description

| Asciidoctor
| Awesome way to write documentation

2+| The statements above say it all

|===
....

renders as:


.Cell spans columns
|===
| Name | Description

| Asciidoctor
| Awesome way to write documentation

2+| The statements above say it all

|===

The `N+` sign notation tells Asciidoctor to span this cell over N columns.


while:

....
.Cell spans rows
|===
| Name | Description

.2+| Asciidoctor
| Awesome way to write documentation

| Works on the JVM

|===
....

renders as:


.Cell spans rows
|===
| Name | Description

.2+| Asciidoctor
| Awesome way to write documentation

| Works on the JVM

|===

The `.N+` notation tells Asciidoctor to span this cell over N rows.


and:

....
.Cell spans both rows and columns
|===

| Row 1, Col 1 | Row 1, Col 2 | Row 1, Col 3

2.2+| Cell spans 2 cols, 2 rows
| Row 2, Col 3
| Row 3, Col 3

|===
....

renders as:

.Cell spans both rows and columns
|===

| Row 1, Col 1 | Row 1, Col 2 | Row 1, Col 3

2.2+| Cell spans 2 cols, 2 rows
| Row 2, Col 3
| Row 3, Col 3

|===

The `N.M+` notation tells Asciidoctor to span this cell over N columns and M rows.



== Admonitions

Callout or highlight content of particular note.

[cols="3a,2a", options="header"]
|===

| Syntax
| Example

|....
NOTE: the entire note must be a single sentence.
....

|NOTE: the entire note must be a single sentence.

|....
[NOTE]
====
the note is multiple paragraphs, and can have all the usual styling,
* eg bullet points:

== Source code

Use `[source]` macro to specify source content:

....
[source,powershell]
----
get-command -module BomiArtifact
----
....

will render as:

[source,powershell]
----
get-command -module BomiArtifact
----

Some languages support syntax highlighting.
For example:

....
[source,java]
----
public class SomeClass extends SomeOtherClass {
    ...
}
----
....

will render as:

[source,java]
----
public class SomeClass extends SomeOtherClass {
    ...
}
----

Callouts can also be added using an appropriate comment syntax.
For example:

....
[source,java]
----
public class SomeClass
                extends SomeOtherClass {        // \<1>
    public static void main(String[] args) {    // \<2>
        ...
    }
}
----
<1> inherits from `SomeOtherClass`
<2> entry point into the program
....

will render as:

[source,java]
----
public class SomeClass
                extends SomeOtherClass {        //<1>
    public static void main(String[] args) {    //<2>
        ...
    }
}
----
<1> inherits from `SomeOtherClass`
<2> entry point into the program


and

....
[source,xml]
----
<a>
    <b c="foo">     \<!--1-->
</a>
----
<1> some comment
....

renders as:

[source,xml]
----
<a>
    <b c="foo">     <!--1-->
</a>
----
<1> some comment


It's also possible to include source code snippets; see the guides linked previously


== Images

Use the `image:` macro to reference images.
For example:

....
image:_images/vscode.png[]
....

To make the image clickable, add in the `link` attribute:

....
image:_images/vscode.png[link="_images/vscode.png"]
....



It's also possible to specify the width using `scaledwidth` (for PDF/HTML) or `width` and `height` (for HTML only).

For example:

....
image:_images/vscode.png[link="_images/vscode.png",width="800px"]
....



== Child Documents


Use the `include:` macro to break up a document into multiple sections.

For example, this xref:dg.adoc#[developers' guide] document is broken into several files:

....
dg.adoc
_dg_ide.adoc
_dg_hints-and-tips.adoc
_dg_building-isis.adoc
...
....

and so on.

These are included using:

[source,asciidoc]
----
\include::_dg_ide.adoc[leveloffset=+1]
\include::_dg_hints-and-tips.adoc[leveloffset=+1]
\include::_dg_building-isis.adoc[leveloffset=+1]
...
----

The `leveloffset=+1` means that each included file's heading levels are automatically adjusted.
The net effect is that all documents can and should use heading 1 as their top-level.

Child documents should have '_' as prefix.
This ensures that they are ignored by the build; only .html and PDF files are created for the top-level parent documents.

The CI/documentation platform also supports the "Improve this doc" button, allowing any document to be edited via the TFS portal; very useful for small fixes.
To make this work, it relies upon the following naming conventions:

* every document should have an id anchor for its level heading corresponding to its file name
* every child document's name should be an '_ followed by the name of its parent.

For example, `dg.adoc` is:

[source,asciidoc]
----
[[dg]]
= Developers' Guide
...
----

while its child document `_dg_ide.adoc` starts with:

[source,asciidoc]
----
= Using an IDE
...
----

In general, we use '_' to separate out the logical hierarchy:

[source]
----
xxx-xxx/xxx-xxx.adoc
        _xxx-xxx_ppp-ppp.adoc
        _xxx-xxx_qqq-qqq.adoc
        _xxx-xxx_qqq-qqq_mmm-mmm.adoc
        _xxx-xxx_qqq-qqq_nnn-nnn.adoc
----

Any referenced images should be in subdirectories of the `_images` directory:

[source]
----
xxx-xxx/_images/.
              /ppp-ppp/.
              /qqq-qqq/.
                      /mmm-mmm
                      /nnn-nnn
----



== Metadata

The top-level document must include the `_basedir` attribute; this points to the parent directory `src/main/asciidoc`.
This attribute is set immediately after the top-level heading.

In addition, the `:toc:` adds a table of contents.

For example, the `setting-up/concepts/concepts.adoc` file starts:

[source,asciidoc]
----
[[concepts]]
= Concepts
:_basedir: ../../

...
----



== UML diagrams

Asciidoctor includes support for the link:http://plantuml.com/[plantuml], allowing simple UML diagrams to be easily sketched.

For example:

....
[plantuml,images/asciidoctor/plantuml-demo,png]
--
class Car

Driver - Car : drives >
Car *- Wheel : have 4 >
Car -- Person : < owns
--
....

renders as:

[plantuml,images/asciidoctor/plantuml-demo,png]
--
class Car

Driver - Car : drives >
Car *- Wheel : have 4 >
Car -- Person : < owns
--




== Ditaa diagrams

Asciidoctor includes support for the link:http://ditaa.sourceforge.net/[ditaa], allowing boxes-and-lines diagrams to be easily sketched.

For example:

....
[ditaa,images/asciidoctor/ditaa-demo,png]
----
    +--------+   +-------+    +-------+
    |        | --+ ditaa +--> |       |
    |  Text  |   +-------+    |diagram|
    |Document|   |!magic!|    |       |
    |     {d}|   |       |    |       |
    +---+----+   +-------+    +-------+
        :                         ^
        |       Lots of work      |
        +-------------------------+
----
....

renders as:

[ditaa,images/asciidoctor/ditaa-demo,png]
----
    +--------+   +-------+    +-------+
    |        | --+ ditaa +--> |       |
    |  Text  |   +-------+    |diagram|
    |Document|   |!magic!|    |       |
    |     {d}|   |       |    |       |
    +---+----+   +-------+    +-------+
        :                         ^
        |       Lots of work      |
        +-------------------------+
----


== Graphviz diagrams


Asciidoctor includes support for the link:http://ditaa.sourceforge.net/[ditaa], allowing boxes-and-lines diagrams to be easily sketched.

For example:

....
[graphviz,images/asciidoctor/graphviz-demo,png]
----
digraph automata_0 {
  size ="8.5, 11";
  node [shape = circle];
  0 [ style = filled, color=lightgrey ];
  2 [ shape = doublecircle ];
  0 -> 2 [ label = "a " ];
  0 -> 1 [ label = "other " ];
  1 -> 2 [ label = "a " ];
  1 -> 1 [ label = "other " ];
  2 -> 2 [ label = "a " ];
  2 -> 1 [ label = "other " ];
  "Machine: a" [ shape = plaintext ];
}
----
....

renders as:

[graphviz,images/asciidoctor/graphviz-demo,png]
----
digraph automata_0 {
  size ="8.5, 11";
  node [shape = circle];
  0 [ style = filled, color=lightgrey ];
  2 [ shape = doublecircle ];
  0 -> 2 [ label = "a " ];
  0 -> 1 [ label = "other " ];
  1 -> 2 [ label = "a " ];
  1 -> 1 [ label = "other " ];
  2 -> 2 [ label = "a " ];
  2 -> 1 [ label = "other " ];
  "Machine: a" [ shape = plaintext ];
}
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
This requires graphviz to be installed and the `dot.exe` on the PATH.
Alternatively, specify the location, eg using:

....
:graphvizdot: c:\Program Files (x86)\Graphviz2.38\bin\dot.exe
....
====
