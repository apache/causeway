The ruby script, `monitor.rb` emulates the `mvn compile` command, regenerating any changed Asciidoctor files to the relevant `target/site` directory.  Moreover if any included files are changed then it rebuilds the parent (per the above naming convention).

== One-time setup

To setup:

* download and install ruby 2.0.0, from link:http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads[http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/]
* download devkit for the Ruby 2.0 installation, also from link:http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads[http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/]. Then follow the link:https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller/wiki/Development-Kit[installation instructions] on their wiki


[NOTE]
====
We use Ruby 2.0 rather than 2.1 because the wdm gem (required to monitor the filesystem if running on Windows) is not currently compatible with Ruby 2.1.
====

To download the required Ruby dependencies, use:

[source,bash]
----
gem install bundler
bundle install
----

== Instant Rebuild

To run, we typically just use:

[source,bash]
----
sh preview-html.sh
----

This script just runs `mvn compile` for HTML files only, then calls `python` to start the web browser and run a simple web server (on port 8000).

If you want to double-check the PDFs also, then use:

[source,bash]
----
sh preview-pdf.sh
----
