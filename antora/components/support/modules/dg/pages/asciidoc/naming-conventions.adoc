For documents with inclusions, use '_' to separate out the logical hierarchy:

[source]
----
xxx-xxx/xxx-xxx.adoc
        _xxx-xxx_ppp-ppp.adoc
        _xxx-xxx_qqq-qqq.adoc
        _xxx-xxx_qqq-qqq_mmm-mmm.adoc
        _xxx-xxx_qqq-qqq_nnn-nnn.adoc
----

Any referenced images should be in subdirectories of the `images` directory:

[source]
----
xxx-xxx/images/.
              /ppp-ppp/.
              /qqq-qqq/.
                      /mmm-mmm
                      /nnn-nnn
----

And similarly any resources should be in the `resources` subdirectory:

[source]
----
xxx-xxx/resources/.
                  ppp-ppp/.
                  qqq-qqq/.
                         /mmm-mmm/
                         /nnn-nnn/
----
