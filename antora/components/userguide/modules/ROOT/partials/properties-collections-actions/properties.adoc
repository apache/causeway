A property is an instance variable of a domain object, of a scalar type, that holds some state in either a xref:userguide:ROOT:domain-services.adoc#domain-entities[domain entity] or a xref:userguide:ROOT:view-models.adoc[view model].

For example, a ``Customer``'s `firstName` would be a property, as would their `accountCreationDate` that they created their account.
All properties have at least a "getter" method, and most properties have also a "setter" method (meaning that they are mutable).
Properties that do _not_ have a setter method are derived properties, and so are not persisted.

Formally speaking, a property is simply a regular JavaBean getter, returning a scalar value recognized by the framework.
Most properties (those that are editable/modifiable) will also have a setter and, if persisted, a backing instance field.
And most properties will also have a number of annotations:

* Apache Causeway defines its own xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/Property.adoc[@Property] annotation for capturing domain semantics.
It also provides a xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/PropertyLayout.adoc[@PropertyLayout] for UI hints (though the information in this annotation may instead be provided by a supplementary xref:userguide:ROOT:ui-layout-and-hints.adoc#object-layout[.layout.xml] file)

* the properties of domain entities are usually also annotated with ORM annotation(s).
+
For xref:pjpa::about.adoc[JPA/EclipseLink] this would be the `jakarta.persistence.Column` annotation.
For property references, there may be other annotations to indicate whether the reference is bidirectional.
It's also possible (using annotations) to define a link table to hold foreign key columns.

* for the properties of view models, then JAXB annotations such as  link:https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/xml/bind/annotation/XmlElement.html[@XmlElement] may be present

Apache Causeway recognises some of these annotations from the persistence layer and infers some domain semantics from them (for example, the maximum allowable length of a string property).

Since writing getter and setter methods adds quite a bit of boilerplate, it's common to use link:https://projectlombok.org/[Project Lombok] to code generate these methods at compile time (using Java's annotation processor) simply by adding the `@lombok.Getter` and `@lombok.Setter` annotations to the field.
The xref:docs:starters:simpleapp.adoc[SimpleApp] starter app uses this approach.

== Value vs Reference Types

Properties can be either a value type (strings, int, date and so on) or be a reference to another object (for example, an `Order` referencing the `Customer` that placed it).

For example, to map a string value type:

[source,java]
----
import lombok.Getter;
import lombok.Setter;

@Getter @Setter        // <.>
private String notes;
----
<1> using link:https://projectlombok.org/[Project Lombok] annotations to reduce boilerplate

You could also add the `@Property` annotation if you wished:

[source,java]
----
import lombok.Getter;
import lombok.Setter;

@Property
@Getter @Setter
private String notes;
----

Although in this case it is not required (none of its attributes have been set).

Or to map a reference type:

[source,java]
----
import lombok.Getter;
import lombok.Setter;

@Property
@Getter @Setter
private Customer customer;
----

It's ok for a xref:userguide:ROOT:view-models.adoc[view model] to reference other view models and also to reference domain entities.
However, it _isn't_ valid for a domain entity to hold a reference to view model, because the ORM will not know how to persist the view model object.


[#optional-properties]
== Optional Properties

(For domain entities) xref:pjpa:ROOT:about.adoc[JPA/Eclipselink] default is that a property is assumed to be optional, regardless of whether it is a primitive type (eg `int`, `boolean`),or a reference type (eg `String`, `BigDecimal` etc).
To override optionality, use the `@Basic(optional="...")` annotation.

Apache Causeway on the other hand assumes that all properties (and action parameters, for that matter) are mandatory, not optional.
These defaults can also be overridden using Apache Causeway' own annotations, specifically `@Property(optionality=...)`, or (because it's much less verbose) using either `@jakarta.annotation.Nullable` or `@org.jspecify.annotations.Nullable`.

These different defaults can lead to incompatibilities between the two frameworks.
To counteract that, Apache Causeway also recognizes and honours JPA's `@Column(nullable=...)`.

For example, you can write:

[source,java]
----
import jakarta.persistence.Column;
import lombok.Getter;
import lombok.Setter;

@Column(nullable=true)
@Property
@Getter @Setter
private LocalDate date;
----

rather than the more verbose:

[source,java]
----
import jakarta.persistence.Column;
import lombok.Getter;
import lombok.Setter;

@Column(nullable=true)
@Property(optionality=Optionality.OPTIONAL)
@Getter @Setter
private LocalDate date;
----

The framework will search for any incompatibilities in optionality (whether specified explicitly or defaulted implicitly) between Apache Causeway' defaults and DataNucleus, and will refuse to boot if any are found.

[#editable-properties]
== Editable Properties

Apache Causeway provides the capability to allow individual properties to be modified.
This is specified using the `@Property(editing=...)` attribute.

For example:

[source,java]
----
import lombok.Getter;
import lombok.Setter;

@Property(editing = Editing.ENABLED)
@Getter @Setter
private String notes;
----

If this is omitted then whether editing is enabled or disabled is inherited from the domain object level, xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/DomainObject.adoc#editing[@DomainObject#editing()].

If that isn't specified (or is set to "AS_CONFIGURED"), then the configuration is taken from the `application.properties` configuration file:

* xref:refguide:config:sections/causeway.applib.adoc#causeway.applib.annotation.domain-object.editing[causeway.applib.annotation.domain-object.editing]
+
for all properties in the domain object.

And, finally, if there is no configuration property set at all, then the default is for editing to be DISABLED.


For entities, editable properties are not necessarily persistable.
In such a case the setter would not write to a field, but would (presumably) mutate the object in some other way.
In such a case you will need a getter and a setter, but the property annotated for the ORM as non-persistent.
(If using xref:pjpa:ROOT:about.adoc[JPA/Eclipselink], this is done using `@jakarta.persistence.Transient`).

For example:

[source,java]
----
import jakarta.inject.Inject;
import jakarta.persistence.Column;
import jakarta.persistence.Transient;
import lombok.Getter;
import lombok.Setter;

@Transient
@Property(editing=Editing.ENABLED)
public String getAddress() {
    return addressService.toAddress( getLatLong() );                // <.>
}
public void setAddress(String address) {
    setLatLong(addressService.toLatLong(address));
}

@Column
@Programmatic
@Getter @Setter
private String latLong;                                             // <.>

@Inject
AddressService addressService;                                      // <.>
----
<.> the representation of the address, in human-readable form, eg "10 Downing Street, London, UK"
<.> the lat/long representation of the address, eg "51.503363;-0.127625".
Excluded from the Apache Causeway metamodel.
<.> an injected service that can convert to/from address and latLong.

== Ignoring Properties

By default Apache Causeway will automatically render all properties in the xref:vw:ROOT:about.adoc[Wicket UI] or in the xref:vro:ROOT:about.adoc[REST API].
To get Apache Causeway to ignore a property (exclude it from its metamodel), annotate the getter using xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/Programmatic.adoc[@Programmatic].

Similarly, for the xref:pjpa:ROOT:about.adoc[JPA/Eclipselink] ORM, ignore a property using the `@jakarta.persistence.Transient` annotation.
This is independent of Apache Causeway; in other words that property will still be rendered in the UI (unless also annotated with `@Programmatic`).

For view models, you can tell JAXB to ignore a property using the `@jakarta.xml.bind.annotation.XmlTransient` annotation.
Again, this is independent of Apache Causeway.

You can also suppress a property from the UI using xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/Property.adoc#hidden[@Property#hidden()] or indeed xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/PropertyLayout.adoc#hidden[@PropertyLayout#hidden()].
However, this doesn't exclude the property from the metamodel.

== Derived Properties

Derived properties are those with a getter but no setter.
These will still be rendered in the UI, but they will be read-only (not editable).

For entities these may or may not be persisted; that depends on whether the ORM annotations are specified on the field or on the property.


== Data types (ORM considerations)

This section shows specific considerations for various datatypes, in particular how to annotate them for the ORM.

This section covers the xref:pjpa:ROOT:about.adoc[JPA/Eclipselink] object store.

=== ``String``s (Length)

By default xref:pjpa:ROOT:about.adoc[JPA/Eclipselink] will map string properties to a `VARCHAR(255)`.
To limit the length, use the `@jakarta.persistence.Column(length=...)` annotation.

For example:

[source,java]
----
import jakarta.persistence.Column;
import lombok.Getter;
import lombok.Setter;

@Column(length=50)
@Property
@Getter @Setter
private String firstName
----

This is a good example of a case where Apache Causeway infers domain semantics from the JPA annotation.


=== ``BigDecimal``s (Precision)

Working with `java.math.BigDecimal` properties takes a little care due to scale/precision issues.

For example, suppose we have:

[source,java]
----
import lombok.Getter;
import lombok.Setter;

@Property
@Getter @Setter
private BigDecimal impact;
----

Without any constraints, the length of the corresponding column is database specific.
For example, with H2 xref:pjpa:ROOT:about.adoc[JPA/Eclipselink] maps to a column NUMERIC(19,2).

Best practice is to explicitly specify the `scale` to the field like this, and probably `precision` also:

[source,java]
----
import jakarta.persistence.Column;
import lombok.Getter;
import lombok.Setter;

@Column(precision=10, scale=2)
@Getter @Setter
private BigDecimal impact;
----

In addition, you should also set the scale of the `BigDecimal`, using `setScale(scale, roundingMode)`.

More information can be found http://www.opentaps.org/docs/index.php/How_to_Use_Java_BigDecimal:_A_Tutorial[here] and http://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/math/bigdecimal_setscale_rm_roundingmode.htm[here].

=== ``Blob``s

Apache Causeway provides the xref:refguide:persistence:index/jpa/applib/types/BlobJpaEmbeddable.adoc[] utility class to allow properties of type `org.apache.causeway.applib.value.Blob` to be persisted.

This is used as follows:

[source,java]
----
@AttributeOverrides({
    @AttributeOverride(name="name",    column=@Column(name="attachment_name")),
    @AttributeOverride(name="mimeType",column=@Column(name="attachment_mimeType")),
    @AttributeOverride(name="bytes",   column=@Column(name="attachment_bytes"))
})
@Embedded
private BlobJpaEmbeddable attachment;

@Property()
@PropertyLayout()
public Blob getPdf() {
  return BlobJpaEmbeddable.toBlob(pdf);
}
public void setPdf(final Blob pdf) {
  this.pdf = BlobJpaEmbeddable.fromBlob(pdf);
}
----

=== ``Clob``s

Mapping ``Clob``s works in a very similar way to ``Blob``s, using the xref:refguide:persistence:index/jpa/applib/types/ClobJpaEmbeddable.adoc[] utility class:

[source,java]
----
@AttributeOverrides({
    @AttributeOverride(name="name",    column=@Column(name="doc_name")),
    @AttributeOverride(name="mimeType",column=@Column(name="doc_mimeType")),
    @AttributeOverride(name="bytes",   column=@Column(name="doc_bytes"))
})
@Getter @Setter
private ClobJpaEmbeddable doc;

@Property()
@PropertyLayout()
public Clob getDoc() {
  return ClobJpaEmbeddable.toClob(doc);
}
public void setDoc(final Clob doc) {
  this.doc = ClobJpaEmbeddable.fromClob(doc);
}
----
