A collection is an instance variable of a domain object, of a collection type that holds references to other domain objects.
For example, a `Customer` may have a collection of ``Order``s).

It's ok for a xref:userguide:ROOT:view-models.adoc[view model] to reference both view model and domain entities.
However, it _isn't_ valid for a domain entity to hold a reference to view model, because the ORM will not know how to persist the view model object.

Formally speaking, a collection is simply a regular JavaBean getter, returning a collection type (subtype of `java.util.Collection`).
Most collections (those that are modifiable) will also have a setter and, if persisted, a backing instance field.
And collections properties will also have a number of annotations:

* Apache Causeway defines its own xref xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/Collection.adoc[@Collection] annotation for capturing domain semantics.
It also provides a xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/CollectionLayout.adoc[@CollectionLayout] for UI hints (though the information in this annotation may instead be provided by a supplementary xref:userguide:ROOT:ui-layout-and-hints.adoc#object-layout[.layout.xml] file)

* the collections of domain entities will typically be annotated with ORM annotation(s).
In the case of xref:pjpa:ROOT:about.adoc[JPA/Eclipselink], this is most notably `jakarta.persistence.Entity`.
The collection itself will likely have its own ORM-specific annotations, to specify for example if the association is bidirectional, supports cascading deletes, or whether to define a link table or not to hold foreign key columns.

* for the collections of view models, then JAXB annotations such as link:https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/xml/bind/annotation/XmlElementWrapper.html[@javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlElementWrapper] and link:https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/xml/bind/annotation/XmlElement.html[@javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlElement] will be present

Apache Causeway may recognise some of these annotations from the persistence layer infers some domain semantics from them.

Unlike xref:userguide:ROOT:properties-collections-actions.adoc#properties[properties], the framework does not allow collections to be "edited".
Instead, xref:userguide:ROOT:properties-collections-actions.adoc#actions[action]s can be written that will modify the contents of the collection as a side-effect.
For example, a `placeOrder(...)` action will likely add an `Order` to the `Customer#orders` collection.

Since writing getter and setter methods adds quite a bit of boilerplate, it's common to use link:https://projectlombok.org/[Project Lombok] to code generate these methods at compile time (using Java's annotation processor) simply by adding the `@lombok.Getter` and `@lombok.Setter` annotations to the field.

== Mapping bidir 1:m

Bidirectional one-to-many collections are one of the most common types of associations between two entities:

[plantuml]
.Parent has many Children, each Child has one Parent.
----
include::docs:resources:partial$plantuml-stereotypes.puml[]

class ParentObject
class ChildObject

ParentObject "1" <-d-> "0.*" ChildObject
----

In the parent object, the collection can be defined as:

[source,java]
----
import javax.jdo.annotations.Persistent;
import lombok.Getter;
import lombok.Setter;

public class ParentObject
        implements Comparable<ParentObject>{

    @Persistent(
        mappedBy = "parent",                                               // <.>
        dependentElement = "false"                                         // <.>
    )
    @Collection                                                            // <.>
    @Getter @Setter
    private SortedSet<ChildObject> children = new TreeSet<ChildObject>();  // <.>

}
----
<.> indicates a bidirectional association; the foreign key pointing back to the `Parent` will be in the table for `ChildObject`
<.> disables cascade delete
<.> (not actually required in this case, because no attributes are set, but acts as a useful reminder that this collection will be rendered in the UI by Apache Causeway)
<.> uses a `SortedSet` (as opposed to some other collection type; discussion below)

while in the child object you will have:

[source,java]
----
import javax.jdo.annotations.Column;
import lombok.Getter;
import lombok.Setter;

public class ChildObject
        implements Comparable<ChildObject> {    // <.>

    @Column(allowsNull = "false")               // <.>
    @Property(editing = Editing.DISABLED)       // <.>
    @Getter @Setter
    private ParentObject parent;
}
----
<.> implements `Comparable` because is mapped using a `SortedSet`
<.> mandatory; every child must reference its parent
<.> cannot be edited directly

Generally speaking you should use `Set` for collection types (as opposed to `List` or `Collection`).


== Maps

While ORMs support `java.util.Map` as a collection type, maps are not supported by Apache Causeway.

If you do wish to use this collection type, then annotate the getter with xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/Programmatic.adoc[@Programmatic] so that it is ignored by the Apache Causeway framework.

== Value vs Reference Types

While ORMs support collections/arrays of value types, such collections are not supported by Apache Causeway.
Apache Causeway can (currently) only provide a UI for collections of references.

If you do wish to use collections of this type, then annotate the getter with xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/Programmatic.adoc[@Programmatic] so that it is ignored by the Apache Causeway framework.

As a workaround, if you want to visualize an array of value types in Apache Causeway, then one option is to wrap the value in a view model.

== Derived Collections

A derived collection is simply a getter (no setter) that returns a `java.util.Collection` (or subtype).

While derived properties and derived collections typically "walk the graph" to associated objects, there is nothing to prevent the returned value being the result of invoking a repository (domain service) action.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {
    ...
    public List<Order> getMostRecentOrders() {
        return orderRepo.findMostRecentOrders(this, 5);
    }
}
----
