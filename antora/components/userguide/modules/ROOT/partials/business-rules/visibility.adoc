== Property or Collection

To hide a property or collection:

[source,java]
----
import lombok.Getter;
import lombok.Setter;

@Getter @Setter
private String status;

public boolean hideStatus() {   // <.>
    // ...
}
----
<.> "hide" prefix, suffix matches up with the property name, and returns a `boolean`.
Returns `true` to hide the property, `false` means it is visible


== Object Action

An object action can be hidden similarly:

[source,java]
----
public Customer placeOrder(Product p, int quantity) {
    // ...
}
public boolean hidePlaceOrder() {                         // <.>
    // ...
}
----
<.> "hide" prefix, suffix matches up with the action's name, and takes no parameters.
Returns `true` to hide the action, `false` means it is visible



== Action Parameter

It is also possible to hide an action parameter, based on the value of some other earlier parameter:
Each `hideNXxx()` method can declare parameters for the previous N-1 parameters, though it need not declare them all.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Order {
    public Order shipTo(
            boolean sameAsBillingAddress,
            String addressLine1,
            String addressLine2,
            String addressCity,
            String addressPostalCode,
            String addressCountry
    ) {
        // ...
    }
    public boolean hide1ShipTo(boolean sameAsBillingAddress) {  // <.>
        return sameAsBillingAddress;
    }
    public boolean hide2ShipTo(boolean sameAsBillingAddress) {
        return sameAsBillingAddress;
    }
    public boolean hide3ShipTo(boolean sameAsBillingAddress) {
        return sameAsBillingAddress;
    }
    public boolean hide4ShipTo(boolean sameAsBillingAddress) {
        return sameAsBillingAddress;
    }
    public boolean hide5ShipTo(boolean sameAsBillingAddress) {
        return sameAsBillingAddress;
    }
}
----
<.> "hide" prefix, N-th param, suffix matches action's name, parameters are subset up to Nth, same type.
Returns `true` to hide the action parameter, `false` means it is visible

In this case, the user can use the `shipTo(...)` action to specify where to ship the `Order` to.
However, if they check the first boolean parameter (ie, to ship the `Order` to the billing address already held on file), then the remaining parameters will all be hidden.

[TIP]
====
If the action is implemented as a xref:mixins.adoc[mixin], then the `disableXxx` supporting method can be matched to the action parameter xref:mixins.adoc#using-the-parameter-name[by name] and also using xref:mixins.adoc#using-a-parameters-class[Parameters] class.
