Having broken up a domain into multiple modules, there is still a need for higher level modules to use lower level modules, and the application must still appear as a coherent whole to the end-user.

The key features that Apache Causeway provides to support this are:

* dependency injection of services
+
Both xref:refguide:applib-svc:about.adoc[framework-defined] domain services and application-defined services (eg repositories and factories) are injected everywhere, using the `@jakarta.inject.Inject` annotation (Spring's `@Autowired` can also be used).
+
By "everywhere", we mean not just into xref:domain-services.adoc[domain services], but _also_ can be injected into xref:domain-entities.adoc[domain entities], xref:view-models.adoc[view models] and xref:mixins.adoc[mixins].
This enables us to implement behaviourally complete domain objects (if we so wish).

* xref:mixins.adoc[mixins] that allow functionality defined in one module to appear (in the UI) to be provided by some other module.
+
For example, a _Document_ module might allow `Document` objects to be attached to any arbitrary domain object (such as `Order` or `Customer`) in other modules.
A mixin would allow the UI for a `Customer` to also display these attached ``Document``s, even though the _Customer_ module would have no knowledge of/dependency on the _Workflow_ module.
(More on this example xref:modules.adoc#inverting-dependencies[below]).
+
Dependencies are also injected into mixins.
A common technique is to factor out from domain objects into mixins and then generalise.

* xref:events.adoc[events] allow modules to influence other modules.
+
A subscriber in one module can subscribe to events emitted by domain objects in another module.
These events can affect both the UI (eg hiding or disabling xref:properties-collections-actions.adoc[object members], or allowing or vetoing interactions).

Using events we can implement referential integrity constraints within the application.
For example, suppose the `customers` module has a `Customer` object and a `EmailAddress` object, with a customer having a collection of email addresses.
A `communications` module might then use those email addresses to create ``EmailCommunication``s.

[plantuml]
.`customers` module and `communications` module
----
include::docs:resources:partial$plantuml-stereotypes.puml[]

package customers {
    class Customer <<ppt>>
    class Email\nAddress <<ppt>>
}

package communications {
    class Email\nCommunication <<mi>>
    class  Sender <<service>>
}

Customer --> "0..*" Email\nAddress
Sender -.l-> "reads\n" Email\nAddress
Sender -.> "creates" Email\nCommunication
Email\nCommunication --> Email\nAddress
----



If the `customers` module wants to delete an `EmailAddress` then the `communications` module will probably want to veto this because they are "in use" by those ``EmailCommunication``s.
Or, it might conceivably perform a cascade delete of all associated communications.
Either way, the `communications` module receives an internal event representing the intention to delete the `EmailAddress`.
It can then act accordingly, either vetoing the interaction or performing the cascade delete.
The `customers` module for its part does not know anything about this other module.
