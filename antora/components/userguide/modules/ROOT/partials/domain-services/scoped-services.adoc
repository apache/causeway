By default all domain services are application-scoped, in other words singletons.
Such domain services are required to be thread-safe, usually satisfied by being intrinsically stateless.

Sometimes though a service's lifetime is applicable only to a single (http) request.
The framework has a number of such services, including a xref:refguide:applib:index/services/scratchpad/Scratchpad.adoc[Scratchpad] service (to share adhoc data between methods), and xref:refguide:applib:index/services/queryresultscache/QueryResultsCache.adoc[QueryResultsCache], which as its name suggests will cache query results.
Such services _do_ hold state, but that state is scoped per (possibly concurrent) request and should be removed afterwards.

The requirement for request-scoped services is supported using Apache Causeway' own xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/InteractionScope.adoc[@InteractionScope] annotation (named because a short-lived `CausewaySession` is created for each request).
This is used by the framework services and can also be used for user-defined services.

For example:

[source,java]
----
@Service
@InteractionScope
public class MyService {
    ...
    public void doSomething() { ... }
}
----

Unlike application-scoped services, these request-scoped services must be injected using a slightly different idiom (borrowed from CDI), using a `jakarta.inject.Provider`.
For example:

[source,java]
----
import jakarta.inject.Provider;

public class SomeClient {
    ...
    @Inject Provider<MyService> myServiceProvider;  // <.>

    public void someMethod() {
        myServiceProvider.get()                     // <.>
                         .doSomething();
}
----
<.> Inject using `Provider`
<.> Obtain an instance using `Provider#get()`


As mentioned above, the xref:refguide:applib:index/services/queryresultscache/QueryResultsCache.adoc[QueryResultsCache] (used for performance caching) is also scoped.
To use that service, the idiom would be:

[source,java]
----
import jakarta.inject.Inject;
import jakarta.inject.Provider;

public class Customer {
    ...
    @Inject OrderRepository orderRepository;
    @Inject Provider<QueryResultsCache> queryResultsCacheProvider;  // <.>

    public List<Order> getOrders() {
        Customer customer = this;
        return queryResultsCacheProvider
                .get()                                              // <.>
                .execute(
                    () -> orderRepository.findByCustomer(customer),
                    Customer.class, "getOrders",
                    customer)
        );
}
----
<.> inject a `Provider` for the service, not directly
<.> Get the cache from the provider

If you accidentally inject the service directly (without being wrapped in `Provider`), then the framework will detect this and fail-fast.
