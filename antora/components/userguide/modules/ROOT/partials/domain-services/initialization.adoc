Sometimes a domain service needs to perform initialization logic before it is ready to be used.

In many cases, such initialization can be performed within the constructor.
If the initialization has dependencies, then these can be injected using standard link:https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/using-spring-boot.html#using-boot-spring-beans-and-dependency-injection[constructor injection].

Alternatively, initialization can be moved into a `@PostConstruct` link:https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/core.html#beans-postconstruct-and-predestroy-annotations[lifecycle callback].
Shutdown is similar; the framework will call any method annotated with `jakarta.annotation.PreDestroy`.

If a domain service needs to wait until the framework is fully initialized though, it should register for the `MetamodelEvent` that is emitted by the framework itself.
One example is if the service is to seed some reference data:

[source,java]
.SimpleModule.java
----
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration

@Service
@Priority(99)
@RequiredConstructor
public class SeedCountryRefData {

    final InteractionService interactionService;
    final TransactionService transactionService;
    final FixtureScripts fixtureScripts;

    @EventListener(MetamodelEvent.class)
    public void init(MetamodelEvent ev) {                       // <.>
        if (ev.isPostMetamodel()) {
            interactionService.runAnonymous(() -> {
                transactionService.runWithinCurrentTransactionElseCreateNew(
                    () -> {
                        fixtureScripts.runFixtureScript(
                            new SeedCountryFixture(), null);    // <.>
                });
            });
        }
    }
}

<.> subscribe to the framework-emitted `MetamodelEvent`
<.> uses xref:refguide:testing:index/fixtures/applib/fixturescripts/FixtureScripts.adoc[] to seed the data using a fixture script.
