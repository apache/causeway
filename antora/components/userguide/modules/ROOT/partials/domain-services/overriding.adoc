Apache Causeway runs on top of Spring Boot, and relies on Spring Boot for dependency injection using `@jakarta.inject.Inject`.
The `@jakarta.annotation.Priority` annotation is used to prioritize multiple service implementations.
This allows any framework-provided domain service to be replaced by a user-defined one if required, simply by assigning it with an earlier precedence (= higher priority).

If this is done, then you will probably also want to implement your replacement using `@org.springframework.context.annotation.Primary`, to resolve the ambiguity of there being more than one implementation of the service on the classpath.

It's also possible to inject a `List<SomeService>`, in which case the list will be ordered with according to their `@Priority`, lowest values first.
