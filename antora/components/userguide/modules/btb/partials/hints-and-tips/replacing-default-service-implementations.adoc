The framework provides default implementations for many of the xref:refguide:applib-svc:about.adoc[domain services].
This is convenient, but sometimes you will want to replace the default implementation with your own service implementation.

For example, suppose you wanted to provide your own implementation of xref:refguide:applib:index/services/i18n/LanguageProvider.adoc[LanguageProvider].
The trick is to use the `@jakarta.annotation.Priority` annotation.

Here's how:

[source,java]
----
@Service
@Priority(PriorityPrecedence.EARLY)                                // <.>
public class MyLanguageProvider implements LanguageProvider { ... }
----
<.> `PriorityPrecedence` (in the Apache Causeway applib) provides some standard values.


== Decorating existing implementations

It's sometimes useful to decorate the existing implementation (ie have your own implementation delegate to the default); this is quite easy to imlpement:

[source,java]
----
@Service
@Priority(PriorityPrecedence.FIRST)                             // <.>
public class MyLanguageProvider implements LanguageProvider {

    @Inject List<LocaleProvider> localeProviders;               // <.>

    @Override
    public Optional<Locale> getPreferredLanguage() {
        return localeProviders.stream()                         // <.>
                .filter(x -> x != this)                         // <.>
                .findFirst()                                    // <.>
                .map(LanguageProvider::getPreferredLanguage)    // <.>
                .orElseThrow(RuntimeException::new);            // <.>
    }
}
----
<.> takes precedence over the default implementation when injected elsewhere.
<.> injects all implementations, including this implementation
<.> streams over all implementations...
<.> \...ignoring this one...
<.> \...uses the next one...
<.> \...and delegate to it.
<.> Fails fast if no other implementations available (should not happen if framework provides a default implementation).

[TIP]
====
None of the default implementations provided by the framework use `PriorityPrecedence(PriorityPrecedence.HIGHEST)`, so all can be overridden if required.
