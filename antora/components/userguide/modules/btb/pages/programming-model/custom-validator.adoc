Apache Causeway' programming model includes a validator component that detects and prevents (by failing fast) a number of situations where the domain model is logically inconsistent.

For example, the validator will detect any orphaned supporting methods (eg `hideXxx()`) if the corresponding property or action has been renamed or deleted but the supporting method was not also updated.
Another example is that a class cannot have a title specified both using `title()` method and also using `@Title` annotation.

You can also impose your own application-specific rules by installing your own metamodel validator.
To give just one example, you could impose naming standards such as ensuring that a domain-specific abbreviation such as "ISBN" is always consistently capitalized wherever it appears in a class member.


== API and Implementation

There are several ways to go about implementing a validator.

=== `MetaModelValidator`

Any custom validator must implement Apache Causeway' internal `MetaModelValidator` interface, so the simplest option is just to implement `MetaModelValidator` directly:

[source,java]
----
package org.apache.causeway.core.metamodel.specloader.validator;

public interface MetaModelValidator {

    default void onFailure(
            @NonNull FacetHolder facetHolder,                       // <.>
            @NonNull Identifier deficiencyOrigin,                   // <.>
            @NonNull String deficiencyMessageFormat,
            Object ...args) {

        val deficiencyMessage =
            String.format(deficiencyMessageFormat, args);

        DeficiencyFacet.appendTo(                                   // <.>
                facetHolder, deficiencyOrigin, deficiencyMessage);
    }
}
----
<.> represents an element of the metamodel, either an `ObjectSpecification` (domain class or mixin), or an `ObjectMember` (property, collection or action), or an `ObjectActionParameter`.
<.> identifier of the element
<.> appends the message into the `DeficiencyFacet` associated with the element.

If the `onFailure` is called, then a message explaining the deficiency is stored.

The framework also provides a `MetaModelValidatorAbstract` that implements this interface.
However, it is the responsibility of the validator itself to figure out how to iterate over the entire model.

Since this is a common use case, the framework provides a more convenient and fine-grained "Visitor" API, discussed next.

=== `Visitor`

More often than not, you'll want to visit every element in the metamodel, and so for this you can instead subclass from `MetaModelValidatorVisiting.Visitor`:

[source,java]
----
package org.apache.causeway.core.metamodel.specloader.validator;

public final class MetaModelValidatorVisiting
                        extends MetaModelValidatorAbstract {

    public interface Visitor {
        public boolean visit(                       // <.>
            ObjectSpecification objectSpec,         // <.>
            ValidationFailures validationFailures); // <.>
    }

    // ...
}
----
<.> return `true` continue visiting specs.
<.> `ObjectSpecification` is the internal API representing a class
<.> add any metamodel violations to the `ValidationFailures` parameter

If you have more than one rule then each can live in its own visitor.

=== `SummarizingVisitor`

As a slight refinement, you can also subclass from `MetaModelValidatorVisiting.SummarizingVisitor`:

[source,java]
----
package org.apache.causeway.core.metamodel.specloader.validator;

public final class MetaModelValidatorVisiting
                        extends MetaModelValidatorAbstract {

    public interface SummarizingVisitor extends Visitor {
        public void summarize(ValidationFailures validationFailures);
    }

    // ...
}
----

A `SummarizingVisitor` will be called once after every element in the metamodel has been visited.
This is great for performing checks on the metamodel as a whole.

== Configuration

Once you have implemented your validator, you must register it with the framework.
This is most easily done by implementing service that implements  `MetaModelRefiner` service.

For example, some folk advocate that pattern names such as "Repository" or "Factory" should not appear in class names because they are not part of the xref:userguide:fun:concepts-patterns.adoc#ubiquitous-language[ubiquitous language].
Such a rule could be verified using this implementation:

[source,java]
----
@Service
public static class NoRepositorySuffixRefiner implements MetaModelRefiner {
    @Override
    public void refineProgrammingModel(ProgrammingModel programmingModel) {
        programmingModel.addValidator(new MetaModelValidatorVisiting.Visitor() {
            @Override
            public boolean visit(ObjectSpecification objectSpec, MetaModelValidator validator) {
                if(objectSpec.getSingularName().endsWith("Repository")) {
                    validator.onFailure(objectSpec, objectSpec.getIdentifier(), "Domain services may not have the suffix 'Repository'");
                }
                return true;
            }
        });
    }
}
----
