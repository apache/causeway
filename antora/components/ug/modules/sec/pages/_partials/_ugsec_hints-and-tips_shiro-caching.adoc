We don't want to repeat the entire link:http://shiro.apache.org/documentation.html[Shiro documentation set] here, but we should flag a number of other features that are worth checking out.




== Caching

To ensure that security operations does not impede performance, Shiro supports caching.  For example, this sets up a simple memory-based cache manager:

[source,ini]
----
memoryCacheManager = org.apache.shiro.cache.MemoryConstrainedCacheManager
securityManager.cacheManager = $memoryCacheManager
----

Other implementations can be plugged in; see the Shiro link:http://shiro.apache.org/caching.html[documentation] for further details.
