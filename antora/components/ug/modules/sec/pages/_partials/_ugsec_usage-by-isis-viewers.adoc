By and large the security mechanisms within Isis are transparent to the rest of the framework (the xref:../ugvw/ugvw.adoc#[Wicket Viewer] and xref:../ugvro/ugvro.adoc#[Restful Objects viewer], and the overall xref:../rgcfg/rgcfg.adoc#_rgcfg[runtime]).

That said, it is the responsibility of the viewers to ensure that for each request there is a valid user session present.  The sections below explain how this works.




== Wicket Viewer

The xref:../ugvw/ugvw.adoc#[Wicket viewer] defines a relatively small number of pages (by which we mean subclasses of link:http://ci.apache.org/projects/wicket/apidocs/6.0.x/org/apache/wicket/markup/html/WebPage.html[`org.apache.wicket.markup.html.WebPage`]):

* about page
* action prompt page
* entity page
* error page
* home page
* standalone collection page
* value page
* void return page

All of these (except about page) are annotated with the Wicket annotation:

[source,java]
----
@AuthorizeInstantiation("org.apache.isis.viewer.wicket.roles.USER")
----

which means that they can only be accessed by a user with an authenticated session that has this special, reserved role.  If not, Wicket will automatically redirect the user to the sign-in page.

[TIP]
====
The sign-in page to render is pluggable; see xref:../ugvw/ugvw.adoc#_ugvw_extending_custom-pages[extensions chapter] for details.
====

In the sign-in page the viewer calls to the Isis Authenticator API, and obtains back a user/role.  It also adds in its special reserved role (per the annotation above) and then continues on to whichever page the user was attempting to access (usually the home page).

And that's really all there is to it.  When the viewer renders a domain object it queries the Apache Isis metamodel, and suppresses from the view any object members (properties, actions etc) that are invisible.  These may be invisible because the user has no (read ) permission, or they may be invisible because of domain object logic (eg a `hideXxx()` method).  The viewer neither knows nor cares.

Similarly, for those object members that _are_ visible, the viewer also checks if they are enabled or disabled.  Again, an object member will be disabled if the user does not have (write) permission, or it could be disabled because of domain object logic (eg a `disableXxx()` method).


=== User-registration

As well as providing a sign-in screen, the Wicket viewer also provides the ability for users to self-register.
By and large this operates outside of Apache Isis' security mechanisms; indeed the various pages (sign-up, sign-up verification, password reset) are all rendered _without_ there being any current user session.
These pages all "reach inside" Apache Isis framework using a mechanism similar to xref:../ugbtb/ugbtb.adoc#_ugbtb_headless-access[Headless access] in order to actually do their stuff.

[TIP]
====
The sign-in verification page to render is pluggable; see xref:../ugvw/ugvw.adoc#_ugvw_extending_custom-pages[extensions chapter] for details.
====

User registration is only available if the xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_persistence-layer-spi_UserRegistrationService[`UserRegistrationService`] is configured; this is used by the framework to actually create new instances of the user as accessed by the corresponding (Shiro) realm.

Because Shiro realms are pluggable, the Apache Isis framework does not provide default implementations of this service.  However, if you are using the (non-ASF) link:http://platform.incode.org[Incode Platform^]'s security module, then this module _does_ provide an implementation (that, as you might expect, creates new "user" domain entities).

If you are using an LDAP realm and want to enable user-self registration then you'll need to write your own implementation of this service.



== Restful Objects Viewer

Unlike the Wicket viewer, the xref:../ugvro/ugvro.adoc#[Restful Objects viewer] does *not* provide any sort of login page; rather it provides a pluggable authentication strategy, delegated to by the `IsisSessionFilter` filter (set up by the framework's web bootstrapping).
The authentication strategy is responsible for ensuring that a session is available for the REST resource.

The API of `AuthenticationSessionStrategy` is simply:

[source,java]
----
package org.apache.isis.core.webapp.auth;
...
public interface AuthenticationSessionStrategy {
    AuthenticationSession lookupValid(     // <1>
        ServletRequest servletRequest,
        ServletResponse servletResponse);
    void bind(                             // <2>
        ServletRequest servletRequest,
        ServletResponse servletResponse,
        AuthenticationSession authSession);
}

----
<1> returns a valid `AuthenticationSession` for the specified request, response
<2> binds (associates the provided `AuthenticationSession`) to the request and response

Here `AuthenticationSession` is Apache Isis' internal API that represents a signed-on user.

The framework provides a number of simple strategies:

* `AuthenticationSessionStrategyBasicAuth` implements the HTTP basic auth protocol (the pop-up dialog box shown by the web browser)
* `AuthenticationSessionStrategyHeader` that simply reads the user identity from an HTTP header
* `AuthenticationSessionStrategyTrusted` that always logs in with a special "exploration" user

As you can see, none of these should be considered production-quality.

The strategy is configured in `web.xml`; for example:

TODO: v2: this has changed, I think, because we now use `WebModule_Xxx` instead of `web.xml`, ie set this stuff up programmatically.

[source,xml]
----
<filter>
    <filter-name>IsisSessionFilterForRestfulObjects</filter-name>
    <filter-class>org.apache.isis.core.webapp.IsisSessionFilter</filter-class>
    <init-param>
        <param-name>authenticationSessionStrategy</param-name>
        <param-value>                                           <!--1-->
    org.apache.isis.viewer.restfulobjects.server.authentication.AuthenticationSessionStrategyBasicAuth
        </param-value>
    </init-param>
    <init-param>
        <param-name>whenNoSession</param-name>
        <param-value>auto</param-value>                         <!--2-->
    </init-param>
    <init-param>
        <param-name>passThru</param-name>
        <param-value>/restful/swagger</param-value>             <!--3-->
    </init-param>
</filter>
----
<1> configure basic auth strategy
<2> what to do if no session was found; we use `auto` so as to issue a 401 status code with basic authentication challenge if the request originated from a web browser.  (Prior to `1.11.0` this parameter was set either to `basicAuthChallenge` (which works when requested from web browser) or to `unauthorized` (which works when requested from a suitably coded custom Javascript app).
<3> which paths are allowed to be accessed directly, without a session.  The `/restful/swagger` path provides access to the SwaggerResource that dynamically generates swagger schema definition files from the Apache Isis metamodel.



The above filter must then be chained before the servlet that actually handles the REST requests:

TODO: v2: this has changed, I think, because we now use `WebModule_Xxx` instead of `web.xml`, ie set this stuff up programmatically.

[source,xml]
----
<filter-mapping>
    <filter-name>IsisSessionFilterForRestfulObjects</filter-name>
    <servlet-name>RestfulObjectsRestEasyDispatcher</servlet-name>
</filter-mapping>
...
<servlet>
    <servlet-name>RestfulObjectsRestEasyDispatcher</servlet-name>
    <servlet-class>org.jboss.resteasy.plugins.server.servlet.HttpServletDispatcher</servlet-class>
</servlet>
----

[NOTE]
====
The above `web.xml` fragments do _not_ constitute the full configuration for the Restful Objects viewer, just those parts that pertain to security.

=== User-registration

Isis currently does not have any out-of-the-box support for user-registration for applications using only the Restful viewer.  However, in principal the pieces do exist to put together a solution.

The general idea is similar to the design of the Wicket viewer; define some subsidiary resources that can operate _without_ a user session in place, and which "reach into" the framework using headless access in order to setup the user.

[TIP]
====
An alternative approach, possibly less work and overall of more value, would be to implement `AuthenticationSessionStrategy` for oAuth, in other words allow users to use their existing Google or Facebook account.
====

The following steps sketch out the solution in a little more detail:

* Define some new Restful resources (cf link:https://github.com/apache/isis/blob/master/core/viewer-restfulobjects-server/src/main/java/org/apache/isis/viewer/restfulobjects/server/resources/DomainObjectResourceServerside.java[`DomainServiceResourceServerside`] that correspond to sign-up/register page, eg `SignupResource` +
+
[source,java]
----
@Path("/signup")
public class SignupResource {
    ...
}
----

* Create a new subclass of `RestfulObjectsApplication`, eg "CustomRestfulObjectsApplication" and register your resources +
+
[source,java]
----
public class CustomRestfulObjectsApplication extends RestfulObjectsApplication {
    public CustomRestfulObjectsApplication() {
        addClass(SignupResource.class);
    }
}
----

* Register your application class in `web.xml` instead of the default: +
+
TODO: v2: this may have changed, because we now use `WebModule_Xxx` instead of `web.xml`, ie set this stuff up programmatically.
+
[source,xml]
----
<context-param>
    <param-name>javax.ws.rs.Application</param-name>
    <param-value>com.mycompany.myapp.CustomRestfulObjectsApplication</param-value>
</context-param>
----

So far this is just standard javax.rs stuff.

Next, we need to ensure that a client can hit your new resource *with* the Apache Isis runtime in place, but without there being an Apache Isis session.  For that....

* create a subclass of the `AuthenticationSessionStrategy` that automatically returns a dummy session if the resource being accessed is "/restful/signup", say.  +
+
You could do this by subclassing `AuthenticationSessionStrategyBasicAuth`, but then using code from `AuthenticationSessionStrategyBasicAuth` to return an "exploration" (or better, "signup") session if accessing the "/restful/signup" resource.

* in the `SignUpResource` resource, you can then do a lookup of the `UserRegistrationService` in order to allow the user to be created: +
+
[source,java]
----
final UserRegistrationService userRegistrationService =
    IsisContext.getPersistenceSession().getServicesInjector().lookupService(UserRegistrationService.class);
userRegistrationService.registerUser(userDetails);
----

Obviously the methods exposed by the `SignupResource` are up to you; ultimately they need to be able to gather information to populate the `UserDetails` object as passed to the `UserRegistrationService`.
