The bypass security component consists of an implementation of both the `AuthenticationManager` and `AuthorizationManager` APIs, and are intended for prototyping use only.

The authentication manager allows access with any credentials (in a sense, "bypassing" authentication), while the authorization manager provides access to all class members (in a sense, "bypassing" authorization).


To tell Apache Isis to bypass security, just update the `WEB-INF/isis.properties` file:

[source,ini]
----
isis.authentication=bypass
isis.authorization=bypass
----

This installs the appropriate no-op implementations for both authentication and authorization:
