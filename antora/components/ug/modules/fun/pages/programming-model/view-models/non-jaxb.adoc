Instead of using JAXB to specify a view model, it is also possible to use Apache Isis-specific annotations.

[WARNING]
====
As was explained xref:ug:fun:programming-model/view-models.adoc[earlier], the approach is described here is neither as flexible nor as powerful as using the JAXB-style of view models.
As such, it may be deprecated in the future.
====

While the underlying technique is the same irrespective of use case, the programming model provides various ways of defining a view model so that the original intent is not lost.
They are:

.View model programming model
[cols="1a,4a,2a", options="header"]

| Use case
| Code
| Description


| External entity
|[source,java]
----
@DomainObject(nature=Nature.EXTERNAL_ENTITY)
public class CustomerRecordOnSAP { ... }
----
|Annotated with xref:rg:ant:DomainObject/nature.adoc[`@DomainObject#nature()`] and a nature of `EXTERNAL_ENTITY`, with memento derived automatically from the properties of the domain object.  Collections are ignored, as are any properties annotated as xref:rg:ant:Property/notPersisted.adoc[not persisted].

| In-memory entity
|[source,java]
----
@DomainObject(nature=Nature.INMEMORY_ENTITY)
public class Log4JAppender { ... }
----
|As preceding, but using a nature of `INMEMORY_ENTITY`.

|Application view model
|[source,java]
----
@DomainObject(nature=Nature.VIEW_MODEL)
public class Dashboard { ... }
----
|As preceding, but using a nature of `VIEW_MODEL`.

|Application view model
|
[source,java]
----
@ViewModel
public class Dashboard { ... }
----

|Annotated with xref:rg:ant:ViewModel.adoc[`@ViewModel`] annotation (effectively just an alias)' memento is as preceding: from "persisted" properties, collections ignored

|Application view model
|
[source,java]
----
public class ExcelUploadManager implements ViewModel {
  public String viewModelMemento() { ... }
  public void viewModelInit(String memento) { ... }
}
----
|Implement xref:rg:cms:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_super_ViewModel[`ViewModel`] interface.  The memento is as defined by the
interface's methods: the programmer has full control (but also full responsibility) for the string memento.
