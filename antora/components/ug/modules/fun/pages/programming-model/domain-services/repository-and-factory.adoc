The repository/factory uses an injected xref:rg:svc:persistence-layer-api/RepositoryService.adoc[`RepositoryService`] to both instantiate new objects and to query the database for existing objects of a given entity type.
It is not visible in UI, rather other services delegate to it.

We suggest naming such classes `XxxRepository`, eg:


[source,java]
----
@DomainService(
    nature=NatureOfService.DOMAIN                               // <1>
)
public CustomerRepository {
    public List<Customer> findByName(String name) {
        return repositoryService.allMatches(                    // <2>
                new QueryDefault<>(Customer.class,
                            "findByName", "name", name);
    }
    public Customer newCustomer(...) {
        Customer Customer =
            repositoryService.instantiate(Customer.class);      // <3>
        ...
        repositoryService.persist(Customer);                    // <3>
        return Customer;
    }
    public List<Customer> allCustomers() {
        return repositoryService.allInstances(Customer.class);
    }
    @Inject
    RepositoryService repositoryService;
}
----
<1> interacted with only programmatically by other objects in the domain layer.
<2> uses injected `RepositoryService` to query via JDOQL.
<3> uses injected `RepositoryService` to first instantiate and then save into the database a new `Customer` instance.

There is no need to annotate the actions; they are implicitly hidden because of the domain service's nature.
