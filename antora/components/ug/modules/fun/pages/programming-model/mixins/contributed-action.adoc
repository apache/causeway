@Mixin(method="act")
public class DocumentHolder_addDocument {

    private final DocumentHolder holder;
    public DocumentHolderDocuments(DocumentHolder holder) { this.holder = holder; }

    @Action()
    @ActionLayout(contributed = Contributed.AS_ACTION)          // <1>
    public Document> act(Document doc) {
        ...
    }
    public boolean hideAct() { ... }                            // <2>
