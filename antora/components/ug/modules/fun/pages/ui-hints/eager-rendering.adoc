By default, parented collections all rendered lazily, in other words in a "collapsed" table view.

For the more commonly used collections we want to show the table expanded:

image::programming-model/todoapp-Dashboard.png[width="px",link="{imagesdir}programming-model/todoapp-Dashboard.png"]

For this we annotate the collection using xref:rg:ant:CollectionLayout/defaultView.adoc[`@CollectionLayout#defaultView()`]; for example

[source,java]
----
@javax.jdo.annotations.Persistent(table="ToDoItemDependencies")
private Set<ToDoItem> dependencies = new TreeSet<>();
@Collection
@CollectionLayout(
    defaultView = "table"
)
public Set<ToDoItem> getDependencies() {
    return dependencies;
}
----


Alternatively, it can be specified the `Xxx.layout.xml` file:

[source,javascript]
----
<bs3:col span="5" cssClass="custom-padding-top-20">
    <cpt:collection id="notYetComplete" defaultView="table" />
    <cpt:collection id="complete" defaultView="table"/>
</bs3col>
----


It might be thought that collections that are eagerly rendered should also be eagerly loaded from the database by enabling the `defaultFetchGroup` attribute:

[source,java]
----
@javax.jdo.annotations.Persistent(table="ToDoItemDependencies", defaultFetchGroup="true")
private Set<ToDoItem> dependencies = new TreeSet<>();
...
----

While this can be done, it's likely to be a bad idea, because doing so will cause DataNucleus to query for more data irrespective of how the object is used/rendered.

Of course, your mileage may vary, so do experiment.
