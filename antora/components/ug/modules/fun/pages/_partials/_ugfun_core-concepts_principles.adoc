Apache Isis is primarily aimed at custom-built "enterprise" applications.
The UI provided by the xref:ug:vw:ugvw.adoc#[Wicket viewer] is intended to be usable by domain experts, typically end-users within the organization.
The REST API exposed by the xref:ug:vro:ugvro.adoc#[RestfulObjects viewer] allows custom apps to be developed -- eg using Angular or similar -- for use by those requiring more guidance; typically end-users outside of the organization.
This section describes some of the core principles and values that the framework aims to honour and support.
