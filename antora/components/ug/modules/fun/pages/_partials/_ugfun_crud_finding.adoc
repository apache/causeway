Retrieving domain entities typically requires a JDOQL query defined on the domain entity, and a corresponding repository service for that domain entity type.
This repository calls the framework-provided xref:rg:svc:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_persistence-layer-api_RepositoryService[`RepositoryService`] to actually submit the query.

For example:

[source,java]
----
@javax.jdo.annotations.Queries({
    @javax.jdo.annotations.Query(                       // <1>
        name = "findByName",                            // <2>
        value = "SELECT "                               // <3>
                + "FROM com.mydomain.myapp.Customer "   // <4>
                + "WHERE name.indexOf(:name) >= 0 ")    // <5>
})
...
public class Customer { ... }
----
<1> There may be several `@Query` annotations, nested within a `@Queries` annotation) defines queries using JDOQL.
<2> Defines the name of the query.
<3> The definition of the query, using JDOQL syntax.
<4> The fully-qualified class name.
Must correspond to the class on which the annotation is defined (the framework checks this automatically on bootstrapping).
<5> In this particular query, is an implementation of a LIKE "name%" query.

and

[source,java]
----
@DomainService(nature=NatureOfService.DOMAIN)
public class CustomerRepository {

    public List<Customer> findByName(String name) {
        return repositoryService.allMatches(            // <1>
                new QueryDefault<>(Customer.class,      // <2>
                            "findByName",               // <3>
                            "name",                     // <4>
                            name);
    }

    @javax.inject.Inject
    RepositoryService repositoryService;
}
----
<1>	The xref:rg:svc:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_persistence-layer-api_RepositoryService[`RepositoryService`] is a generic facade over the JDO/DataNucleus API.
<2> Specifies the class that is annotated with @Query
<3> Corresponds to the `@Query#name()` attribute
<4> Corresponds to the `:name` parameter in the query JDOQL string

Whenever a query is submitted, the framework will automatically "flush" any pending changes.
This ensures that the database query runs against an up-to-date table so that all matching instances (with respect to the current transaction) are correctly retrieved.


When an object is loaded from the database the framework will emit `ObjectLoadedEvent` xref:ug:fun:ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_building-blocks_events_lifecycle-events[lifecycle event].


== Type-safe queries

DataNucleus also supports type-safe queries; see xref:rg:svc:rgsvc.adoc#__rgsvc_persistence-layer-api_IsisJdoSupport_type-safe-jdoql-queries[here] for further details.
