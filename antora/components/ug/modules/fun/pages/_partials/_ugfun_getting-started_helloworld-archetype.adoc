The quickest way to start learning about Apache Isis is to run the `helloworld` archetype.
This will generate a tiny Apache Isis app, consisting of a simple one-class domain model, called `HelloWorldObject`, and a supporting `HelloWorldObjects` domain service.
Both the business logic and supporting bootstrapping classes are in a single Maven module (in different Java packages).

[TIP]
====
We don't recommend that you use the helloworld archetype as the basis for your own applications.
Instead, use the xref:ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_getting-started_simpleapp-archetype[simpleapp archetype].
This also creates a minimal application, but provides more structure and example tests, useful as you build out your own app.

[[__ugfun_getting-started_helloworld-archetype_generating-the-app]]
== Generating the App

Create a new directory, and `cd` into that directory.

To build the app from the latest stable release, then run the following command:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
mvn archetype:generate  \
    -D archetypeGroupId=org.apache.isis.archetype \
    -D archetypeArtifactId=helloworld-archetype \
    -D archetypeVersion={isiscurr} \
    -D groupId=com.mycompany \
    -D artifactId=myapp \
    -D version=1.0-SNAPSHOT \
    -B
----

where:

- `groupId` represents your own organization, and
- `artifactId` is a unique identifier for this app within your organization.
- `version` is the initial (snapshot) version of your app

The archetype generation process will then run; it only takes a few seconds.



[[__ugfun_getting-started_helloworld-archetype_structure-of-the-app]]
== Structure of the App

As noted above, the application generated by the helloworld archetype is deliberately simplified, with everything contained within a single Maven module.

Under `src/main/java` we have:

[monotree]
----
> src/
>> main/
>>> java/
>>>> domainapp/
>>>>> application/
>>>>>> HelloWorldAppManifest.java
>>>>>> isis-non-changing.properties
>>>>>> menubars.layout.xml
>>>>> dom/
>>>>>> HelloWorldModule.java
>>>>>> impl/
>>>>>>> HelloWorldObject.java
>>>>>>> HelloWorldObject.layout.xml
>>>>>>> HelloWorldObject.png
>>>>>>> HelloWorldObjects.java
>>>> META-INF/
>>>>> persistence.xml
----


For simplicity, all the Java source files generated by the archetype are placed in a `domainapp` top-level package.

[NOTE]
====
While it's more conventional to use the inverse domain name for package (eg `com.mycompany.myapp`, that's only really appropriate for library code that will be released for reuse by multiple applications in different orgnisations (eg open source).

For internal application though this is less of a concern; indeed, avoiding using the domain name means that if the company rebrands or is taken over then nothing needs be changed.

Of course, you are always free to move the classes to a different package if you wish.
====

In `domainapp.application` package is `HelloWorldAppManifest`, which implements the `AppManifest` interface defined by the Apache Isis applib.
The class is only small, so is worth showing here in its entirety:

[source,java]
----
public class HelloWorldAppManifest extends AppManifestAbstract {
    public static final Builder BUILDER = Builder
            .forModules(HelloWorldModule.class)
            .withConfigurationPropertiesFile(
                HelloWorldAppManifest.class, "isis-non-changing.properties")
            .withAuthMechanism("shiro");

    public HelloWorldAppManifest() {
        super(BUILDER);
    }
}
----

Rather than implement `AppManifest` directly, `HelloWorldAppManifest` uses the builder provided by the convenience `AppManifestAbstract2`); as you'll find when you work on bigger applications, it's common to have variations around the app manifest, so the builder makes it easy to create these variations without lots of boilerplate.

For now, we see that (using the builder) the app manifest defines three things:

* a list of modules - there's just one, `HelloWorldModule` for this class
* the location of a configuration file, `isis-non-changing.properties`, read in as a resource from the classpath
* specifying an authentication/authorisation mechanism, in this case Apache Shiro integration.

In Apache Isis a module has various responsibilities, but the most important is simply its location.
The framework uses classpath scanning to find certain classes; rather than scan the entire classpath it limits its search to the package(s) of the application's module(s).

The packages are scanned to identify three types of classes:

* all entities.
+
These are entities that are annotated with `@javax.jdo.annotations.PersistenceCapable`.
These are passed through to the JDO (DataNucleus) object store, in order to create database mappings from the entities to relational tables
+
In the helloworld application, the only entity is `HelloWorldObject`.

* all domain services
+
These are classes that are annotated with the framework's `@DomainService` annotation.
Depending on their nature, services are used to build up the menu, or are available to call programmatically, eg repositories.
The framework instantiates an instance of each and will automatically inject the services into other domain objects and services.
+
In the helloworld application, the only domain service  is `HelloWorldObjects`.
This appears in the menu, and also acts as a repository for the `HelloWorldObject` entity.

* all fixture scripts
+
These are classes that extend from the applib `FixtureScript` class, and are used to setup the database when running in prototype mode (against an in-memory database).
+
The helloworld application doesn't provide any examples of these.

The app manifest also identifies the `isis-non-changing.properties` file (in the same package as `HelloWorldAppManifest`) as containing various configuration options.
The helloworld application uses these for settings that are unlikely to change and so are loaded as a static resource from the classpath.

You'll find that there's also a similar file called `isis.properties`, which resides at `WEB-INF/isis.properties`.
This also provides configuration options (the framework simply combines them) but those in `WEB-INF/isis.properties` are restricted to settings that are likely to change from environment to environment, most notably JDBC URL connection strings.
Separating these out makes it easy to reconfigure the application to run against different databases in different environments (dev, test, production etc).

Finally, the app manifest identifies Apache Shiro for authentication and authorisation.
Shiro in turn is configured using the `WEB-INF/shiro.ini` file.

[TIP]
====
The security integration provided by Apache Isis and Shiro is quite sophisticated; to get started though you can just login using username: `sven`, password: `pass`.
====

The `menubars.layout.xml` file also resides in the same package as the manifest; this defines the menubar structure.

In the `domainapp.dom` module ("dom" stands for "domain object model") is the `HelloWorldModule`:

[source,java]
----
package domainapp.dom;
public final class HelloWorldModule {
    private HelloWorldModule(){}
}
----

As already explained, this is simply used by the app manifest to identify "domainapp.dom" as the package to scan to locate entities (`HelloWorldObject`), services (`HelloWorldObjects`) and fixture scripts (none provided).

In the `domainapp.dom.impl` we have the classes that actually comprise our domain object.
These are a little large to list here in their entirety, but it's worth calling out:

* `HelloWorldObject`:

** is annotated with a bunch of JDO annotations, `@PersistenceCapable` being the most important.
+
This annotation is what identifies the class as an entity, so that Apache Isis passes through to JDO/DataNucleus during bootstrapping (to create the ORM mappings).

** is also annotated with Isis' own `@DomainObject`.
+
This isn't mandatory, but since entities are the real building blocks on which Apache Isis applications are built, it's very common to use this annotation.

* `HelloWorldObject.layout.xml` defines the layout of the members (properties and actions) of the `HelloWorldObject`.
+
Layout files are optional - Apache Isis is an implementation of the naked objects pattern, after all - but in most cases you'll find it easiest to use one

* `HelloWorldObject.png` is used as an icon for any instances of the domain object shown in the (Wicket) viewer

* `HelloWorldObjects` is a domain service by virtue of the fact that it is annotated with Isis' `@DomainService`.
+
This acts as both a menu (the `@DomainService#nature` attribute) and also a repository to find/create instances of `HelloWorldObject`.

The `META-INF/persistence.xml` also relates to domain entities.
JDO/DataNucleus allows metadata mapping information to be specified using either XML or annotations.
In the Apache Isis community we generally prefer to use annotations, but nevertheless this file is required, even though it is basically empty:

[source,xml]
----
<persistence xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/persistence"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/persistence http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/persistence/persistence_1_0.xsd" version="1.0">

    <persistence-unit name="helloworld"/>
</persistence>
----

[NOTE]
====
In previous versions of Apache Isis the simple app defined its own subclass of `IsisWicketApplication` in `src/main/java`.
This is generally no longer required because configuration properties now exist that can be set instead.
====

Under `src/main/webapp` we have various resources that are used to configure the webapp, or that are served up by the running webapp:

[monotree]
----
> src/
>> main/
>>> webapp/
>>> welcome.html
>>>> about/
>>>>> index.html
>>>> css/
>>>>> application.css
>>>> scripts/
>>>>> application.js
>>>> swagger-ui/
>>>> WEB-INF/
>>>>> isis.properties
>>>>> logging.properties
>>>>> shiro.ini
>>>>> web.xml
----

Most important of these is `WEB-INF/web.xml`, which bootstraps both the Wicket viewer and the Restful Objects viewer (the REST API derived from the domain object model).

The text of the welcome page shown by the Wicket viewer can be found in `welcome.html`.
This is shown in the absence of a home page action/view model.

The `about/index.html` is the page shown at the root of the package, providing links to either the Wicket viewer or to the Swagger UI.
In a production application this is usually replaced with a page that does an HTTP 302 redirect to the Wicket viewer.

In `css/application.css` you can use to customise CSS, typically to highlight certain fields or states.
The pages generated by the Wicket viewer have plenty of CSS classes to target.
You can also implement the `cssClass()` method in each domain object to provide additional CSS classes to target.

Similarly, in `scripts/application.js` you have the option to add arbitrary Javascript.
JQuery is available by default.

In `swagger-ui` is a copy of the Swagger 2.x UI classes, preconfigured to run against the REST API exposed by the Restful Objects viewer.
This can be useful for developing custom applications, and is accessible from the initial page (served up by `about/index.html`).

Finally in `WEB-INF` we have the standard `web.xml` (already briefly discussed) along with several other files:

* `isis.properties` contains further configuration settings for Apache Isis itself.
+
(As already discussed), these are in addition to the configuration properties found in the `isis.properties` that lives alongside and that is loaded by the `HelloWorldAppManifest` class.
Those in the WEB-INF/isis.properties file are those that are likely to change when running the application in different environments.

* `logging.properties` configures log4j.
+
The framework is configured to use slf4j running against log4j.

* `shiro.ini` configures Apache Shiro, used for security (authentication and authorisation)

* `web.xml` configures the Wicket viewer and Restful Objects viewer.
It also sets up various filters for serving up static resources with caching HTTP headers.

Under `src/test/java` we have:

[monotree]
----
> src/
>> test/
>>> java/
>>>> domainapp/
>>>>> dom/
>>>>>> impl/
>>>>>>> HelloWorldObjectTest_delete.java
>>>>>>> HelloWorldObjectTest_updateName.java
----

These are very simple unit tests of `HelloWorldObject`.
They use JMock as the mocking library (with some minor extensions provided by Apache Isis itself).

Finally, at the root directory we of course have the `pom.xml`.
Some notable points:

* since this module generates a WAR file, the `pom.xml` uses `<packaging>war</packaging>`

* maven mixins are used to remove boilerplate configuration of standard plugins (resources, compile, jar etc), for the DataNucleus enhancer, for surefire (tests), and for running the application using jetty plugin

Now you know your way around the code generated by the archetype, lets see how to build the app and run it.



[[__ugfun_getting-started_helloworld-archetype_building-the-app]]
== Building the App

Switch into the root directory of your newly generated app, and build your app:

[source,bash]
----
cd myapp
mvn clean install
----

where `myapp` is the `artifactId` entered above.


[[__ugfun_getting-started_helloworld-archetype_running-the-app]]
== Running the App

The `helloworld` archetype generates a single WAR file, configured to run both the xref:../ugvw/ugvw.adoc#[Wicket viewer] and the xref:../ugvro/ugvro.adoc#[Restful Objects viewer].
The archetype also configures the DataNucleus/JDO Objectstore to use an in-memory HSQLDB connection.

Once you've built the app, you can run the WAR in a variety of ways.


=== Using mvn Jetty plugin

First, you could run the WAR in a Maven-hosted Jetty instance, though you need to `cd` into the `webapp` module:
(using maven 3.5.0 / isis 1.15 there is no webapp module and there is no need to `cd`into a `webapp` module. just run mvn jetty:run to fire up the app )

[source,bash]
----
mvn jetty:run
----


You can also provide a system property to change the port:

[source,bash]
----
mvn jetty:run -D jetty.port=9090
----


=== Using a regular servlet container

You can also take the built WAR file and deploy it into a standalone servlet container such as [Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org).
The default configuration does not require any configuration of the servlet container; just drop the WAR file into the `webapps` directory.



=== From within the IDE

Most of the time, though, you'll probably want to run the app from within your IDE.
The mechanics of doing this will vary by IDE; see the xref:../dg/dg.adoc#_dg_ide[Developers' Guide] for details of setting up Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA.
Basically, though, it amounts to running `org.apache.isis.WebServer`, and ensuring that the xref:../dg/dg.adoc#_dg_hints-and-tips_datanucleus-enhancer[DataNucleus enhancer] has properly processed all domain entities.

Here's what the setup looks like in IntelliJ IDEA:

image::getting-started/helloworld.png[width="600px",link="{_imagesdir}getting-started/helloworld.png"]

with the maven goal to run the DataNucleus enhancer (discussed in more detail xref:../dg/dg.adoc#_dg_hints-and-tips_datanucleus-enhancer[here]) before launch defined as:

image::getting-started/helloworld-before-launch.png[width="600px",link="{_imagesdir}getting-started/helloworld-before-launch.png"]



[[__ugfun_getting-started_helloworld-archetype_using-the-app]]
== Using the App

When you start the app, you'll be presented with a welcome page from which you can access the webapp using either the xref:../ugvw/ugvw.adoc#[Wicket viewer] or the xref:../ugvro/ugvro.adoc#[Restful Objects viewer]:

image::getting-started/using-hello-world/010-root-page.png[width="600px",link="{_imagesdir}getting-started/using-hello-world/010-root-page.png"]

The Wicket viewer provides a human usable web UI (implemented, as you might have guessed from its name, using link:http://wicket.apache.org[Apache Wicket]), so choose that and navigate to the login page:

image::getting-started/using-hello-world/020-login-to-wicket-viewer.png[width="600px",link="{_imagesdir}getting-started/using-hello-world/020-login-to-wicket-viewer.png"]

The app itself is configured to run using xref:../ugsec/ugsec.adoc#[shiro security], as configured in the `WEB-INF/shiro.ini` config file.  You can login with:

* username: _sven_
* password: _pass_


Once you've logged in you'll see the default home page:

image::getting-started/using-hello-world/030-home-page.png[width="600px",link="{_imagesdir}getting-started/using-hello-world/030-home-page.png"]


The application is configured to run with an in-memory database, so initially there is no data.
Create an object using the menu:

image::getting-started/using-hello-world/040-create-object-from-menu.png[width="600px",link="{_imagesdir}getting-started/using-hello-world/040-create-object-from-menu.png"]

which brings up a modal dialog:

image::getting-started/using-hello-world/050-create-object-from-menu-prompt.png[width="600px",link="{_imagesdir}getting-started/using-hello-world/050-create-object-from-menu-prompt.png"]

hitting OK returns the created object:

image::getting-started/using-hello-world/060-created-object.png[width="600px",link="{_imagesdir}getting-started/using-hello-world/060-created-object.png"]

The above functionality is implemented by link:https://github.com/apache/isis/blob/master/example/application/helloworld/src/main/java/domainapp/dom/impl/HelloWorldObjects.java#L43[this code]:

[source,java]
----
@Action(semantics = SemanticsOf.NON_IDEMPOTENT)
@MemberOrder(sequence = "1")
public HelloWorldObject create(
        @Parameter(maxLength = 40)
        @ParameterLayout(named = "Name")
        final String name) {
    final HelloWorldObject object = new HelloWorldObject(name);
    serviceRegistry.injectServicesInto(object);
    repositoryService.persist(object);
    return object;
}
----

The `HelloWorldObject` contains a couple of properties, and a single action to update that property.

* The `name` property is read-only, and can only be modified using the `updateName` action. +
+
For example:
+
image::getting-started/using-hello-world/070-update-name.png[width="600px",link="{_imagesdir}getting-started/using-hello-world/070-update-name.png"]
+
The above functionality is implemented by link:https://github.com/apache/isis/blob/master/example/application/helloworld/src/main/java/domainapp/dom/impl/HelloWorldObject.java#L73[this code]: +
+
[source,java]
----
@Action(
    semantics = SemanticsOf.IDEMPOTENT,
    command = CommandReification.ENABLED,
    publishing = Publishing.ENABLED
)
public HelloWorldObject updateName(
        @Parameter(maxLength = 40)
        @ParameterLayout(named = "Name")
        final String name) {
    setName(name);
    return this;
}
----

* The `notes` property is editable, and can be edited in-place. +
+
For example:
+
image::getting-started/using-hello-world/080-edit-notes.png[width="600px",link="{_imagesdir}getting-started/using-hello-world/080-edit-notes.png"]

It's also possible to delete an object:

image::getting-started/using-hello-world/090-delete-object.png[width="600px",link="{_imagesdir}getting-started/using-hello-world/090-delete-object.png"]

The viewer displays a message confirming that the object has been deleted:


image::getting-started/using-hello-world/100-object-deleted.png[width="600px",link="{_imagesdir}getting-started/using-hello-world/100-object-deleted.png"]

The above functionality is implemented by link:https://github.com/apache/isis/blob/master/example/application/helloworld/src/main/java/domainapp/dom/impl/HelloWorldObject.java#L87[this code]:

[source,java]
----
@Action(semantics = SemanticsOf.NON_IDEMPOTENT_ARE_YOU_SURE)
public void delete() {
    final String title = titleService.titleOf(this);
    messageService.informUser(String.format("'%s' deleted", title));
    repositoryService.removeAndFlush(this);
}
----

This uses three services provided by the framework; these are injected into the domain object automatically.


Going back to the home page (link:http://localhost:8080[localhost:8080]) we can use link:https://swagger.io/[Swagger UI] as a front-end to the REST API provided by the Restful Objects viewer.

image::getting-started/using-hello-world/200-swagger-ui-before-reload.png[width="600px",link="{_imagesdir}getting-started/using-hello-world/200-swagger-ui-before-reload.png"]

The Swagger UI is created dynamically from a Swagger schema definition (the schema definition file itself can be downloaded from the Wicket viewer's "Prototyping" menu).
 This Swagger schema definition groups resources according to Apache Isis metadata:

image::getting-started/using-hello-world/210-helloworld-resources.png[width="600px",link="{_imagesdir}getting-started/using-hello-world/210-helloworld-resources.png"]

For example, an object can be created using the resource that represents the `HelloWorldObjects#create` action:

image::getting-started/using-hello-world/220-create-object-thru-rest-api.png[width="600px",link="{_imagesdir}getting-started/using-hello-world/220-create-object-thru-rest-api.png"]

The response indicates that the object was successfully created:

image::getting-started/using-hello-world/230-create-object-thru-rest-api-response.png[width="600px",link="{_imagesdir}getting-started/using-hello-world/230-create-object-thru-rest-api-response.png"]

The Swagger UI also provides a resource to retrieve any object:

image::getting-started/using-hello-world/240-retrieve-object-using-rest-api.png[width="600px",link="{_imagesdir}getting-started/using-hello-world/240-retrieve-object-using-rest-api.png"]

This results in a representation of the domain object (as per the requested `Response Content Type`, ie `ACCEPT` header):

image::getting-started/using-hello-world/250-retrieve-object-using-rest-api-response.png[width="600px",link="{_imagesdir}getting-started/using-hello-world/250-retrieve-object-using-rest-api-response.png"]


The Swagger UI is provided as a convenience; the REST API is actually a complete hypermedia API (in other words you can follow the links to access all the behaviour exposed in the regular Wicket app).
The REST API implemented by Apache Isis is specified in the link:http://www.restfulobjects.org[Restful Object spec].


[[__ugfun_getting-started_helloworld-archetype_experimenting]]
== Experimenting with the App

Once you are familiar with the generated app, try modifying it.
There is plenty more guidance on this site; start with this guide (fundamentals) and then look at the other guides available the main xref:../../documentation.adoc#[documentation] page.

If you use IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse, do also install the xref:../dg/dg.adoc#__dg_ide_intellij_live-templates[live templates (for IntelliJ)] / xref:../dg/dg.adoc#__dg_ide_eclipse_editor-templates[editor templates (for Eclipse)]; these will help you follow the Apache Isis naming conventions.

If you run into issues, please don't hesitate to ask for help on the link:http://isis.apache.org/help.html[users mailing list].


[[__ugfun_getting-started_helloworld-archetype_moving-on]]
== Moving on

When you are ready to start working on your own app, we _don't_ recommend building on top of the helloworld app.

Instead, we suggest that you start with the xref:ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_getting-started_simpleapp-archetype[simpleapp archetype] instead.
Although a little more complex, it provides more structure and tests, all of which will help you as your application grows.
