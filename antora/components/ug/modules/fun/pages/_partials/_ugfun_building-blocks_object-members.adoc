Every domain object in Apache Isis consists of (at most) three types of members:

* properties, such as a ``Customer``'s `firstName`

* collections, such as a ``Customer``'s `orders` collection of ``Order``s

* actions, such as a ``Customer'``s `placeOrder(...)` method.

Some domain objects -- specifically domain services and mixins -- only have actions.
In the case of contributing services and mixins these actions can (depending upon their semantics and signatures) be represented as derived properties or collections on the entity/view model to which they contribute/mix-in.


== Properties

Properties follow the standard getter/setter pattern, with the return type being a scalar (a value object or another entity or view model).

For example, with:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer
    private String firstName;
    public String getFirstName() { return firstName; }
    public void setFirstName(String firstName) { this.firstName = firstName; }
    ...
}
----

the framework infers the `Customer` domain entity, which in turn has a `firstName` string _property_.


== Collections

Collections are also represented by a getter and setter, however the return type is a `Collection` or subtype.

For example, with:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer
    private SortedSet<Order> orders = new TreeSet<Order>();
    public SortedSet<Order> getOrders() { return orders; }
    public void setOrders(SortedSet<Order> orders) { this.orders = orders; }
    ...
}
----

the framework infers the `orders` _collection_.

[TIP]
====
The most commonly used collection type is `java.util.SortedSet`; entities are most commonly mapped to a relational database (ie a datastore with set semantics) and we recommend that all entities define a natural ordering so that when rendered in the UI they will be ordered "meaningfully" to the end-user.
====


== Actions

The third type of object member is actions.
(To a first approximation), actions are all public methods that do not represent properties or collections.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer
    public Customer placeOrder(Product p, int quantity) { ... }
    ...
}
----

corresponds to the `placeOrder` _action_.

[NOTE]
====
The above _is_ a simplification; the Apache Isis programming model also recognizes a number of other supporting methods each of which has its own prefix such as `hide`, `disable` or `validate`.
These can be considered as "reserved words" in Apache Isis, and do _not_ correspond to actions even though they have public visibility.
