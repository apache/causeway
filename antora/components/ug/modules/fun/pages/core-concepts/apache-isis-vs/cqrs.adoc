The link:https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html[CQRS architectural pattern] (it stands for "Command Query Responsibility Separation") is the idea that the domain objects that mutate the state of the system - to which commands are sent and which then execute - should be separated from the mechanism by which the state of the system is queried (rendered).
The former are sometimes called the "write (domain) model", the latter the "read model".

In the canonical version of this pattern there are separate datastores.
The commands act upon a command/write datastore.
The data in this datastore is then replicated in some way to the query/read datastore, usually denormalized or otherwise such that it is easy to query.

CQRS advocates recommend using very simple (almost naive) technology for the query/read model; it should be a simple projection of the query datastore.
Complexity instead lives elsewhere: business logic in the command/write model, and in the transformation logic betweeen the command/write and read/query datastores.
In particular, there is no requirement for the two datastores to use the same technology: one might be an RDBMS while the other a NoSQL datastore or even datawarehouse.

In most implementations the command and query datastores are _not_ updated in the same transaction; instead there is some sort of replication mechanism.
This also means that the query datastore is eventually consistent rather than always consistent; there could be a lag of a few seconds before it is updated.
This means in turn that CQRS implementations require mechanisms to cater for offline query datastores; usually some sort of event bus.

The CQRS architecture's extreme separation of responsibilities can result in a lot of boilerplate.
Any given domain concept, eg `Customer`, must be represented both in the command/write model and also in the query/read model.
Each business operation upon the command model is reified as a command object, for example `PlaceOrderCommand`.

Comparing CQRS to Apache Isis, the most obvious difference is that Apache Isis does not separate out a command/write model from a query/read model, and there is usually just a single datastore.
But then again, having a separate read model just so that the querying is very straightforward is pointless with Apache Isis because, of course, Isis provides the UI "for free".

There are other reasons though why a separate read model might make sense, such as to precompute particular queries, or against denormalized data.
In these cases Apache Isis can often provide a reasonable alternative, namely to map domain entities against RDBMS views, either materialized views or dynamic.
In such cases there is still only a single physical datastore, and so transactional integrity is retained.

Or, the CQRS architecture can be more fully implemented with Apache Isis by introducing a separate read model, synchronized using the xref:rg:svc:persistence-layer-spi/PublisherService.adoc[`PublisherService`], or using xref:rg:cms:classes/super/AbstractSubscriber.adoc[subscribers]  on the xref:rg:svc:core-domain-api/EventBusService.adoc[`EventBusService`].
One can then use xref:ug:fun:building-blocks/types-of-domain-objects/view-models.adoc[view models] to surface the data in the external read datastore.

With respect to commands, Apache Isis does of course support the xref:rg:svc:application-layer-spi/CommandService.adoc[`CommandService`] which allows each business action to be reified into a `Command`.
However, names are misleading here: Apache Isis' commands are relatively passive, merely recording the intent of the user to invoke some operation.
In a CQRS architecture, though, commands take a more active role, locating and acting upon the domain objects.
More significantly, in CQRS each command has its own class, such as `PlaceOrderCommand`, instantiated by the client and then executed.
With Apache Isis, though, the end-user merely invokes the `placeOrder(...)` action upon the domain object; the framework itself creates the `Command` as a side-effect of this.

In CQRS the commands correspond to the business logic that mutates the system.
Whether this logic is part of the command class (`PlaceOrderCommand`) or whether that command delegates to methods on the domain object is an implementation detail; but it certainly is common for the business logic to be wholly within the command object and for the domain object to be merely a data holder of the data within the command/write datastore.

In Apache Isis this same separation of business logic from the underlying data can be accomplished most straightforwardly using xref:ug:fun:building-blocks/types-of-domain-objects/mixins.adoc[mixins].
In the UI (surfaced by the xref:vw:ROOT::about.adoc[Wicket viewer]) or in the REST API (surfaced by the xref:vro:ROOT::about.adoc[RestfulObjects viewer]) the behaviour appears to reside on the domain object; however the behaviour actually resides on separate classes and is mixed in (like a trait) only at runtime.
