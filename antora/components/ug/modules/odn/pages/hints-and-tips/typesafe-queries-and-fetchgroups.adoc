Fetch groups provide a means to hint to DataNucleus that it should perform a SQL join when querying.
A common use case is to avoid the xref:ugodn.adoc#_ugodn_hints-and-tips_diagnosing-n-plus-1[n+1] issue.

(So far as I could ascertain) it isn't possible to specify fetch group hints using JDOQL, but it is possible to specify them using the programmatic API or using typesafe queries.

For example, here's a JDOQL query:

[source,java]
----
@Query(
		name = "findCompletedOrLaterWithItemsByReportedDate", language = "JDOQL",
		value = "SELECT "
				+ "FROM org.estatio.capex.dom.invoice.IncomingInvoice "
				+ "WHERE items.contains(ii) "
				+ "   && (ii.reportedDate == :reportedDate) "
				+ "   && (approvalState != 'NEW' && approvalState != 'DISCARDED') "
				+ "VARIABLES org.estatio.capex.dom.invoice.IncomingInvoiceItem ii "
),
public class IncomingInvoice ... { ... }
----

which normally would be used from a repository:


[source,java]
----
public List<IncomingInvoice> findCompletedOrLaterWithItemsByReportedDate(
        final LocalDate reportedDate) {
    return repositoryService.allMatches(
            new QueryDefault<>(
                    IncomingInvoice.class,
                    "findCompletedOrLaterWithItemsByReportedDate",
                    "reportedDate", reportedDate));
}
----


This can be re-written as a type-safe query as follows:

[source,java]
----
public List<IncomingInvoice> findCompletedOrLaterWithItemsByReportedDate(final LocalDate reportedDate) {

    final QIncomingInvoice ii = QIncomingInvoice.candidate();
    final QIncomingInvoiceItem iii = QIncomingInvoiceItem.variable("iii");

    final TypesafeQuery<IncomingInvoice> q =
        isisJdoSupport.newTypesafeQuery(IncomingInvoice.class);

    q.filter(
            ii.items.contains(iii)
        .and(iii.reportedDate.eq(reportedDate))
        .and(ii.approvalState.ne(IncomingInvoiceApprovalState.NEW))
        .and(ii.approvalState.ne(IncomingInvoiceApprovalState.DISCARDED)));
    final List<IncomingInvoice> incomingInvoices = Lists.newArrayList(q.executeList());
    q.closeAll();
    return incomingInvoices;
}
----

Now the `IncomingInvoice` has four fields that require eager loading.
This can be specified by defining a named fetch group:

[source,java]
----
@FetchGroup(
        name="seller_buyer_property_bankAccount",
        members={
                @Persistent(name="seller"),
                @Persistent(name="buyer"),
                @Persistent(name="property"),
                @Persistent(name="bankAccount")
        })
public class IncomingInvoice ... { ... }
----


This fetch group can then be used in the query using `q.getFetchPlan().addGroup(...)`.
Putting this all together, we get:

[source,java]
----
public List<IncomingInvoice> findCompletedOrLaterWithItemsByReportedDate(final LocalDate reportedDate) {

    final QIncomingInvoice ii = QIncomingInvoice.candidate();
    final QIncomingInvoiceItem iii = QIncomingInvoiceItem.variable("iii");

    final TypesafeQuery<IncomingInvoice> q =
        isisJdoSupport.newTypesafeQuery(IncomingInvoice.class);

    q.getFetchPlan().addGroup("seller_buyer_property_bankAccount");     // <1>

    q.filter(
            ii.items.contains(iii)
        .and(iii.reportedDate.eq(reportedDate))
        .and(ii.approvalState.ne(IncomingInvoiceApprovalState.NEW))
        .and(ii.approvalState.ne(IncomingInvoiceApprovalState.DISCARDED)));
    final List<IncomingInvoice> incomingInvoices = Lists.newArrayList(q.executeList());
    q.closeAll();
    return incomingInvoices;
}
----
<1> specify the fetch group to use.
