These configuration properties are typically stored in `WEB-INF/persistor_datanucleus.properties`.  However, you can place all configuration properties into `WEB-INF/isis.properties` if you wish (the configuration properties from all config files are merged together).

== Configuration Properties for Apache Isis itself

.JDO/DataNucleus Objectstore Configuration Properties
[cols="2a,2a,2a", options="header"]

|Property
|Value +
(_default value_)
|Description

|`isis.persistor.` +
`datanucleus.` +
`standaloneCollection.` +
`bulkLoad`
|`true`, `false` +
(`false`)
|Enables bulk load of standalone collections.

Further xref:ug:odn:configuring/bulk-load.adoc[discussion below].

|`isis.persistor.` +
`datanucleus.` +
`classMetadataLoadedListener`
|fully qualified class name +
(`o.a.i.os.` +
`jdo.dn.` +
`CreateSchemaObject` +
`FromClassMetadata`)
|The default implementation creates a DB schema object.

There generally is no need to change this from its default.

|`isis.persistor.` +
`datanucleus.` +
`RegisterEntities.` +
`packagePrefix`
|fully qualified package names, CSV
|This property is derived automatically derived from the set of modules provided in the xref:rg:cms:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_super_AppManifest[`AppManifest`], and so does not need to be specified explicitly.

It holds the set of packages to search so that DataNucleus builds its metamodel eagerly rather than lazily.

Only intended for "emergency use" as a workaround while pending fix/patch to Apache Isis itself.  (Note that there is no "datanucleus" in the property).
