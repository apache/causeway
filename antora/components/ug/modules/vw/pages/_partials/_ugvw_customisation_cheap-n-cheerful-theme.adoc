The application name (as defined by `isis.viewer.wicket.application.name` configuration property) is also used (in sanitized form) as the CSS class in a `<div>` that wraps all the rendered content of every page.

For example, if the application name is "ToDo App", then the `<div>` generated is:

[source,html]
----
<div class="todo-app">
    ...
</div>
----

You can therefore use this CSS class as a way of building your own "theme" for the various elements of the wicket viewer pages.
