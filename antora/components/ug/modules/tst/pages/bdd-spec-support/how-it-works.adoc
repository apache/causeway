At a high level, here's how Cucumber works

* specifications are written in the https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Gherkin[Gherkin] DSL, following the https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Given-When-Then["given/when/then"] format.

* Cucumber-JVM itself is a JUnit runner, and searches for https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Feature-Introduction[feature files] on the classpath.

* These in turn are matched to link:https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Step-Definitions[step definition]s through regular expressions. +

It is the step definitions (the "glue") that exercise the system.

The code that goes in step definitions is broadly the same as the code that goes in an integration test method.  One benefit of using step definitions (rather than integration tests) is that the step definitions are reusable across scenarios, so there may be less code overall to maintain.  For example, if you have a step definition that maps to "given an uncompleted todo item", then this can be used for all the scenarios that start with that as their precondition.
