As discussed in the introductory overview of this chapter, Apache Isis allows you to integration test your domain objects from within JUnit.  There are several parts to this:

* configuring the Apache Isis runtime so it can be bootstrapped (mostly boilerplate)
* defining a base class to perform said bootstrapping
* using fixture scripts to set up the app
* using `WrapperFactory` so that the UI can be simulated.

We'll get to all that shortly, but let's start by taking a look at what a typical integration test looks like.
