The `BackgroundCommandExecution` class (a subclass of xref:ug:btb:headless-access/AbstractIsisSessionTemplate.adoc[AbstractIsisSessionTemplate]) is intended to simplify the execution of background ``Command``s persisted by way of the xref:rg:svc:application-layer-spi/CommandService.adoc[`CommandService`] and the xref:rg:svc:application-layer-spi/BackgroundCommandService.adoc[`BackgroundCommandService`].

Its signature is:

[source,java]
----
public abstract class BackgroundCommandExecution extends AbstractIsisSessionTemplate {
    protected void doExecute(Object context) { /* ... */ }
    protected abstract List<? extends Command> findBackgroundCommandsToExecute(); // <1>
}
----
<1> `findBackgroundCommandsToExecute()` is a mandatory hook method for subclasses to implement.

This allows for different implementations of the `CommandService` and `BackgroundCommandService` to persist to wherever.

The diagram below (http://yuml.me/edit/363b335f[yuml.me/363b335f]) shows the dependencies between these various classes:

== Background Execution

The `BackgroundCommandExecutionFromBackgroundCommandServiceJdo` is a concrete subclass of `BackgroundCommandExecution` (see the xref:rg:svc:application-layer-api/BackgroundService.adoc[`BackgroundCommandService`]), the intended use being for the class to be instantiated regularly (eg every 10 seconds) by a scheduler such as http://quartz-scheduler.org[Quartz]) to poll for ``Command``s to be executed, and then execute them.

This implementation queries for ``Command``s persisted by the (non-ASF) link:http://platform.incode.org[Incode Platform^]'s command module's  implementations of xref:rg:svc:application-layer-spi/CommandService.adoc[`CommandService`] and xref:rg:svc:application-layer-spi/BackgroundCommandService.adoc[`BackgroundCommandService`] using the `BackgroundCommandServiceJdoRepository`.

The diagram below (link:http://yuml.me/edit/25343da1[yuml.me/25343da1]) shows the inheritance hierarchy for this class:
