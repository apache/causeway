From this link:http://isis.markmail.org/thread/yf7qdeiu3vrvk2ei[thread] on the Apache Isis users mailing list:

* _When using a `void` action, let's say a remove action, the user is redirected to a
page "no results".
When clicking the back button in the browser the user sees "Object not found" (since you've just deleted this object)._

* _You can return a list for example to prevent the user from being redirect to a
  "No results" page, but I think it's not the responsibility of the controllers in
  the domain model._

* _A solution could be that wicket viewer goes back one page when
  encountering a deleted object.
And refresh the current page when receiving a null response or invoking a void action.
But how to implement this?_

One way to implement this idea is to provide a custom implementation of the xref:rg:svc:rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_presentation-layer-spi_RoutingService[`RoutingService`] SPI domain service.
The default implementation will either return the current object (if not null), else the home page (as defined by xref:rg:ant:rgant.adoc#_rgant-HomePage[`@HomePage`]) if one exists.

The following custom implementation refines this to use the breadcrumbs (available in the Wicket viewer) to return the first non-deleted domain object found in the list of breadcrumbs:

[source,java]

@DomainService(nature = NatureOfService.DOMAIN)
@DomainServiceLayout(menuOrder = "1")                                           // <1>
public class RoutingServiceUsingBreadcrumbs extends RoutingServiceDefault {
    @Override
    public Object route(final Object original) {
        if(original != null) {                                                  // <2>
            return original;
        }
        repositoryService.flush();                                              // <3>

        final BreadcrumbModelProvider wicketSession =                           // <4>
            (BreadcrumbModelProvider) AuthenticatedWebSession.get();
        final BreadcrumbModel breadcrumbModel =
            wicketSession.getBreadcrumbModel();
        final List<EntityModel> breadcrumbs = breadcrumbModel.getList();

        final Optional<Object> firstViewModelOrNonDeletedPojoIfAny =
                breadcrumbs.stream()                                            // <5>
                .filter(entityModel -> entityModel != null)
                .map(EntityModel::getObject)                                    // <6>
                .filter(objectAdapter -> objectAdapter != null)
                .map(ObjectAdapter::getObject)                                  // <7>
                .filter(pojo -> !(pojo instanceof Persistable) ||
                                !((Persistable)pojo).dnIsDeleted())             // <8>
                .findFirst();

        return firstViewModelOrNonDeletedPojoIfAny.orElse(homePage());          // <9>
    }
    private Object homePage() {
        return homePageProviderService.homePage();
    }
    @Inject
    HomePageProviderService homePageProviderService;
    @Inject
    RepositoryService repositoryService;
}
----
<1> override the default imlpementation
<2> if a non-null object was returned, then return this
<3> ensure that any persisted objects have been deleted.
<4> reach inside the Wicket viewer's internals to obtain the list of breadcrumbs.
<5> loop over all breadcrumbs
<6> unwrap the Wicket viewer's serializable representation of each domain object (`EntityModel`) to the Isis runtime's
representation (`ObjectAdapter`)
<7> unwrap the Isis runtime's representation of each domain object (`ObjectAdapter`) to the domain object pojo itself
<8> if object is persistable (not a view model) then make sure it is not deleted
<9> return the first object if any, otherwise the home page object (if any).

Note that the above implementation uses Java 8, so if you are using Java 7 then you'll need to backport accordingly.
