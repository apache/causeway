== Changes to the Wrapper Factory API

Control classes `SynControl` and `AsyncControl` have been slightly modified, 
those are immutable now but do support 'withers' to setup the desired control.

Factories `SynControl.control()` and `AsyncControl.control()` were 
renamed to `#defaults()`.

`WrapperFactory.asyncWrap` and other `async*` sibling methods no longer return a `Future<T>` 
but an `AsyncProxy<T>` which allows interaction with the proxied domain
in a more type safe manner.

[source,java]
.Example usage
----
// transaction scoped call to retrieve an attached counter entity
var counter = bookmarkService
    .lookup(bookmark, Counter.class).orElseThrow();

// returns a Future<Counter>
var proxy = wrapperFactory.asyncWrap(counter)
    .applyAsync(Counter::bumpUsingDeclaredAction);
          
// then later ...

// returns the detached counter entity
var counter2 = proxy
    .tryGet(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS) // blocking
    .valueAsNonNullElseFail(); 

assertThat(counter2.getNum()).isEqualTo(2L);
