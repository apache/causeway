In link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAUSEWAY-3896[CAUSEWAY-3896] we made a small change to the API for the xref:refguide:applib:index/services/wrapper/WrapperFactory.adoc[WrapperFactor]'s async programming model.

For example:

[source,java]
----
var counter = bookmarkService.lookup(bookmark, Counter.class).orElseThrow();

var counter = wrapperFactory.asyncWrap(counter)                 // <.>
          .applyAsync(Counter::bumpUsingDeclaredAction)
          .tryGet(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS)                          // <.>
          .valueAsNonNullElseFail();

assertThat(counter.getNum()).isEqualTo(2L);
----
<.> returns the detached counter entity
<.> wait max 5 sec to allow executor to complete before continuing
