Apache Causeeway v4 is based on Spring Boot v4.
In this milestone release, much of the porting has been done, now based on Spring Boot 4.0.0-M3.

Significant other changes in this release:

* JDO support has now been removed.
Instead use JPA (EclipseLink)

* RestEasy has been removed as a dependency, instead Spring's support for REST is used instead.

* logging has moved from log4j2 to slf4j.
