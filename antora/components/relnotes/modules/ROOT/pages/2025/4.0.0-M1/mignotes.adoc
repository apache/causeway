== RestEasy Integration Removed

The Restful Objects viewer no longer has a dependency on JBoss RestEasy, instead using Spring REST APIs.
As a consequence, the name of the Maven artifact and Spring configuration module have changed, as well as some configurations.

* In your Maven `pom.xml`
+
remove:
+
[source,xml]
.Maven
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.causeway.viewer</groupId>
    <artifactId>causeway-viewer-restfulobjects-jaxrsresteasy</artifactId>
</dependency>
----
+
and use instead:
+
[source,xml]
.Maven
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.causeway.viewer</groupId>
    <artifactId>causeway-viewer-restfulobjects-viewer</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

* in your `AppManifest` (`@Import` staatements):
+
replace:
+
[source,java]
.Spring bean import
----
@Import({
    //..
    CausewayModuleViewerRestfulObjectsJaxrsResteasy.class,
    // ...
})
----
+
instead with:
+
[source,java]
.Spring bean import
----
@Import({
    //..
    CausewayModuleViewerRestfulObjectsViewer.class,
    // ...
})
----

* in your `application.yaml` configuration properties, change the config properties that configures the servlet-context relative path prefix for the _Restful Objects Viewer_
+
replace:
+
[source,yaml]
.application.yaml (Spring configuration properties)
----
resteasy:
  jaxrs:
    defaultPath: /restful
----
+
replace with:
+
[source,yaml]
.application.yaml (Spring configuration properties)
----
causeway:
  viewer:
    restfulobjects:
      basePath: /restful
----
+


== Immutable Configuration

`CausewayConfiguration` was refactored using Java records over regular classes,
in effect all accessors have been renamed, stripping any `get` or `is` prefixes.
`CausewayConfiguration` is now immutable.

== ErrorDetails

`ErrorDetails` as used by the `ErrorReportingService` has been converted from a class to a record.
(In effect all accessors have been renamed, stripping any `get` or `is` prefixes)

== Object Icon Support

Object support method `FontAwesomeLayers iconFaLayers()` has been replaced by `IconResource icon(IconWhere iconWhere)`,
which also supports image data embedding and supersedes `String iconName()`.
However, the latter is still supported for backward compatibility.

With `TitleService` method
`String iconNameOf(final Object domainObject)` was replaced by
    `IconResource iconOf(Object domainObject, IconWhere iconWhere)`.

Likewise `IconUiEvent` was updated to reflect the new programming model.
