This is primarily a security release to address CVE-2025-64408, which was a Java deserialization vulnerability to authenticated attackers.

The vulnerability applied to view models, not entities.
The fix involves encrypting the view model memento using HMAC 256 encryption key.
By default, a new key is created each time the application is restarted, which means that any bookmark of a view model will become invalid in subsequent runs.

If you require stable (but still secure) bookmarks across runs, then this can be done by providing a custom implementation of the `HmacAuthority` bean (to override the default provided by the framework).

See the xref:2025/3.5.0/mignotes.adoc[Migration notes] for further details.
