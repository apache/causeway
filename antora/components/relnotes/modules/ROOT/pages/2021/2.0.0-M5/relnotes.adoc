The main new feature in this release is to add support for JPA persistence as an alternative to JDO.
This included support for Spring Data.

In order to keep the two persistence implementations as consistent as possible, the JDO integration was substantially reworked.
Data source URLs are now configured using Spring configuration properties (for either JPA or JDO).

The xref:security:secman:about.adoc[SecMan] integration was extended to also provide a JPA implementation, and was also reworked to use logical type names rather than physical package names.
The notion of xref:refguide:applib:index/id/LogicalType.adoc[LogicalType] was also formally added into the applib.

One notable breaking change: the XSDs for schemas were changed, with `transactionId` being renamed to `interactionId`.

Documentation tooling was also developed to automate large parts of the xref:refguide::about.adoc[Reference Guide], as well as to provide a xref:core:_overview:about.adoc[System Overview].
