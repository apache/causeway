This release adds plenty of new features, along with numerous improvements and bugfixes.

Highlights are:

* full support for the `CommandPublisher`,`ExecutionPublisher` and `EntityPropertyChangePublisher` SPIs for both JPA and JDO.
* support for keycloak authentication (leveraging Spring security)
* view models for serializable classes now view models;
* a library of architecture tests to detect possible programming issues with your domain apps
* `InteractionFactory` now part of the applib, allowing full control of the framework session

Also, the minimum version of Java was bumped to JDK11.
