== Changes to the Programming Model

=== Removed (Programming Model)

[cols="2a,3a", options="header"]

|===

| was
| now what?

| `@Action(associateWithSequence=...)` removed
| use `@ActionLayout(sequence=...)` instead

| `@MemberOrder(name=...)` removed
| instead on a _Property_ use `@PropertyLayout(fieldSetId=..., fieldSetName=...)` 
or on an _Action_ use `@Action(associateWith=...)`; 
there is no counterpart for _Collection_ 

| `@MemberOrder(sequence=...)` removed
| use `@ActionLayout/@PropertyLayout/@CollectionLayout(sequence=...)` instead

| `@Model` (from extensions) removed
| use `@MemberSupport`  (Applib) instead

|===

== Configuration

Following configuration options changed:
[source,java]
----
isis.core.meta-model.validator.ensure-unique-object-types // removed

isis.core.meta-model.validator.explicit-object-type // renamed to ...
isis.core.meta-model.validator.explicit-logical-type-names 
----

== Other Changes

Module `IsisModuleExtCorsImpl` was renamed to `IsisModuleExtCors`. 

Module `IsisModuleExtModelAnnotation` was removed and is no longer required.

Service `BookmarkService` has been improved, such that its methods return `Optional<?>` instead of nullable objects. 

Service `RepositoryService.isPersistent(Object domainObject)` has been removed. Use `getEntityState(Object domainObject)` instead.

Service `RepositoryService.isDeleted(Object domainObject)` has been removed. Use `getEntityState(Object domainObject)` instead.

Enum `EntityState.PERSISTABLE_DESTROYED` and `isDestroyed()` were renamed to `PERSISTABLE_REMOVED` and `isRemoved()`. Also note: the `removed` entity life-cycle state is only supported by _JDO_, 
whereas _JPA_ is indifferent to whether an entity instance was `removed` or is `detached`. The framework's JPA integration will always report `detached`.    


The _Wicket Viewer_ was migrated from using _Bootstrap 3_ to _Bootstrap 4_, which might have more or less severe implications on (your) customized _CSS_ and _JavaScript_ and _Wicket_ components.
