This is a further milestone release, consolidating the "re-platforming" of Apache Isis on top of Spring Boot.

Much of the emphasis in this release has been on stabilisation and regression testing.
That said, there are some new features.
The release includes support for a new (additional) link:https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/ISIS/ActionParameters?focusedCommentId=158867933#comment-158867933[programming model for action parameters], allowing for more sophisticated management of parameters that interact with each other.
On the flip side, support for contributed actions from domain services has been removed; use xref:refguide:applib-classes:mixins.adoc[Mixins]instead.

This release also has a reworking/simplification of the command service and background commands.
This includes new extension modules to persist commands (xref:extensions:command-log:about.adoc[Command Log] and xref:extensions:command-replay:about.adoc[Command Replay], to assist regression testing.

Also in this release, the xref:incubator:kroviz:about.adoc[Kroviz client] has been brought into the incubator.
This is a single-page app that runs within the browser to provide a UI similar to that of the xref:vw:ROOT:about.adoc[Wicket Viewer], but interacting with the domain application exclusively through the REST API provided by the xref:vro:ROOT:about.adoc[Restful Objects Viewer].

The release also includes some preliminary work preparing the way for support for JPA (as an alternative to xref:pjdo:ROOT:about.adoc[JDO/DataNucleus].
This support is expected to be in the next milestone release.

Other work done in this release includes an experimental porting of the build system from Maven to gradle (though Maven is for now still the official build system of the framework).

The example demo app has also been fleshed out considerably as both a regression tests and to provide living documentation; the docker image can be downloaded from link:https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/apacheisis/demo-wicket[docker hub].
