After almost six years effort (!), v2.0.0 and v3.0.0 are the first official releases of Apache Causeway, now re-platformed to run on Spring Boot.
The two versions are being released at the same time.


The v3.0.0 release is broadly equivalent to the v2.0.0 release.
As such, see the xref:2024/2.0.0/relnotes.adoc[2.0.0] release notes for full details of the features available in this release.

However, 3.0.0:

* targets Spring Boot 3.x (instead of Spring Boot 2.x)
* targets Java 17 (instead of Java 11)

It also uses the `jakarta` namespace rather than `javax`.


There is one functional change, namely that support for xref:security:shiro:about.adoc[Shiro security] module has been dropped (for now).
See the xref:relnotes:ROOT:2024/3.0.0/mignotes.adoc#simple-security-replacement-for-shiro[migration notes] for options.
