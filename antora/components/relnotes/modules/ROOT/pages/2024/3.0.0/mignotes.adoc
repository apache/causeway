To upgrade from v2.0 to v3.0:

* move up to Java 17 (minimum)
* update namespaces from `javax` to `jakarta`
* if you are using the xref:security:shiro:about.adoc[Shiro security] module, this will need to choose a different security implementation.

This last point is discussed xref:#simple-security-replacement-for-shiro[below].

[#simple-security-replacement-for-shiro]
== Simple Security, Replacement for Shiro (link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAUSEWAY-3698[CAUSEWAY-3698])

In 3.0.0, the Shiro modules are no longer distributed because Apache Shiro have not yet released a `jakarta` namespaced version of their framework.


There are several migration options:

* first is to leverage xref:security:spring:about.adoc[Spring Security].
+
This can be extended in various ways, eg for xref:security:spring-oauth2:about.adoc[OAuth2] support.
It is commonly paired with xref:security:secman:about.adoc[SecMan] for authorization

* or, use xref:security:secman:about.adoc[SecMan] for both authentication and authorization

* or, use xref:security:simple:about.adoc[Simple Security] which provides a programmatic approach for implementing an `Authenticator` and/or `Authorizor`.
+
It is broadly equivalent to the Shiro `.ini` realm.

We will revisit this as and when Apache Shiro release a suitable version of their framework.
