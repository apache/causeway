Apache Isis automatically scans for certain classes on the classpath in order to configure itself.  Specifically these are:

* searching for classes annotated with link:https://isis.apache.org/versions/1.9.0/guides/rgant/rgant.html#_rgant-DomainService[`@DomainService`].

* searching for classes extending link:https://isis.apache.org/versions/1.9.0/guides/rgcms/rgcms.html#_rgcms_classes_super_FixtureScript[`FixtureScript`]

* searching for classes annotated with link:https://isis.apache.org/versions/1.9.0/guides/rgant/rgant.html#_rgant-PersistenceCapable[`@PersistenceCapable`].

For the last of these we have tightened up the validation, to ensure that each package specified in the `isis.persistor.datanucleus.RegisterEntities.packagePrefix` key does indeed include at least one annotated entity.  This should include any domain classes for addon modules.

For example, the http://github.com/apache/isis-app-todoapp[TodoApp]'s configuration now reads:

[source,ini]
----
isis.persistor.datanucleus.RegisterEntities.packagePrefix=\
                todoapp.dom.module,\
                org.isisaddons.module.security.dom,\
                org.isisaddons.module.settings.dom,\
                org.isisaddons.module.sessionlogger.dom,\
                org.isisaddons.module.command.dom,\
                org.isisaddons.module.audit.dom,\
                org.isisaddons.module.publishing.dom
----

[TIP]
====
Alternatively, could have just specified `org.isisaddons.module` instead of enumerating every addon.  This would be a bit slower, but more maintainable.
====

If you fail to do specify all packages things may still work, however DataNucleus will build up its metamodel lazily.  This can call issues: we've seen malformed SQL being submitted when DN wasn't aware of subclasses of a superclass, and we've also seen deadlocks when running against HSQLDB as it attempts to perform a DDL statement intermixed with DML statements.
