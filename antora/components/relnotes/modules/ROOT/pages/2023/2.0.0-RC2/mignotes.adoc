This page will be added to as development progresses.

== Programming Model

=== Removed
* `ActionLayout#bookmarking` ... had conflicting semantics with `DomainObjectLayout#bookmarking`,
that is, if the latter was present on an Action's return type, hence removed.
+
(Also, originally the intent was for action prompts to be bookmarked, but this was never implemented).

* The `causeway-extensions-shiro-realm-ldap` extension has been removed.
+
This extension extended Shiro's own `DefaultLdapRealm` realm to provide support for authorisation (statically defined in the `shiro.ini` file).
Instead, use Shiro's own `DefaultLdapRealm` but configure with some other authorisation mechanism, eg Secman.

=== Marked Deprecated for Removal
* `Action#hidden` ... use `ActionLayout#hidden` instead
* `Collection#hidden` ... use `CollectionLayout#hidden` instead
* `Property#hidden` ... use `PropertyLayout#hidden` instead

Parameter support method `validateNXxx(...)` is now supported to only have a single argument,
namely the parameter, that is subject to validation.

[WARNING]
====
This may potentially change behavior
for cases when the action's first and the n-th parameter
are the same type and
given a single argument parameter support method with same type also,
then previously it interpreted the support to be associated with
the first parameter, while now it will interpret the support to be
associated with the n-th parameter. (using _n_ as 1-based here)
====

== Maven Artifacts

Incubator projects `viewer-vaadin` and `viewer-javafx` were discontinued in version 2.x,
but these are continued in version 3.x.

=== v1 schemas

The v1 versions of the schemas for `common`, `chg`, `cmd` and `ixn` have been made available (again) under link:https://causeway.apache.org/schema-v1[].
