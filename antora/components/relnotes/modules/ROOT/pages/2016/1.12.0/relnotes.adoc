The main feature in 1.12.0 is much enhanced support for custom layouts, using an optional separate XML layout file `Xxx.layout.xml` (where `Xxx` is the class of the object being rendered).  This is similar in concept to the earlier support we have had for custom layouts through a `.layout.json` file, but introduces the ability to position object members anywhere using bootstrap columns and rows.  It also brings in
support for tabgroups, and allows object members to be included in the page more than once (eg a table view and also a (non-ASF) link:https://platform.incode.org[Incode Platform^]`'s fullcalendar2 view).

As a result of this change, the support for editing objects has been modified; rather than an 'edit' button which toggles the entire
page into edit mode, instead each property is edited individually.  The current implementation of this is using a prompt dialog (very
similar to the action prompt dialogs; in a future release we hope to support "in-place" edits instead.

Another notable change in this release include various new domain services.
Some of these are in support of the file-based layouts functionality, others including new access into Apache Isis' metamodel.
(Some of these new services were originally part of the (non-ASF) link:http://www.isisaddons.org[Isis Addons]).
In addition, the link:https://isis.apache.org/versions/1.12.0/guides/rgsvc/rgsvc.html#_rgsvc_core-domain-api_DomainObjectContainer[`DomainObjectContainer`] service has been deprecated, replaced by a number of fine-grained services (such as link:https://isis.apache.org/versions/1.12.0/guides/rgsvc/rgsvc.html#_rgsvc_persistence-layer-api_RepositoryService[`RepositoryService`] and link:https://isis.apache.org/versions/1.12.0/guides/rgsvc/rgsvc.html#_rgsvc_application-layer-api_MessageService[`MessageService`]).

The release also includes a number of new mixins, to automatically surface in the UI an entity's id, version (if any), and to download the layout XML and rebuild the metamodel for a given domain entity.
There is also a mixin to clear any UI hints (part of the file-based layouts functionality).
In all cases these mixins can be hidden using either security or by writing a link:https://isis.apache.org/versions/1.12.0/guides/rgcms/rgcms.html#_rgcms_classes_super_AbstractSubscriber[subscriber] to veto the visibility of the corresponding domain event.
