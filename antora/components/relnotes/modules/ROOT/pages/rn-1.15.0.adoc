The main new feature of `1.15.0` is inline prompts: the ability to edit a property or invoke an action (associated with a property) without requiring a modal dialog box.
There have also been several improvements in the ability to tab around the UI.

The version of Apache Wicket has also been upgraded from `6.x` to `7.x`.

Most applications written against v1.14.x should run against v1.15.0 with few if any changes.
That said, we do recommend that you read and keep in mind the link:https://isis.apache.org/versions/1.15.0/migration-notes/migration-notes.html#_migration-notes_1.14.0-to-1.15.0[migration notes] when you upgrade your app.

[NOTE]
====
The supporting (non-ASF) link:http://isisaddons.org[Isis Addons] and link:http://catalog.incode.org[Incode Catalog] have also been combined into a single link:https://platform.incode.org["Incode Platform"].

While each module can still be consumed individually, the new platform versions consistently (a change in any one module will result in a re-release of all).
This should make these modules easier to consume, and easier to maintain/develop.

All the modules remain open source, still licensed under the ASF v2.0 license.
