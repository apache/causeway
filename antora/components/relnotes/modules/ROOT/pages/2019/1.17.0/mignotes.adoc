== Sidebar Dialogs

In this release sidebar dialogs vs modal dialogs is configured globally, and they are enabled by default.

To revert to previous behaviour, set the configuration property:

[source,ini]
.isis.properties
----
isis.viewer.wicket.dialogMode=modal
----


== MetaModelService

To export the metamodel as XML, use `MetaModelService6#exportMetaModel(Config)`.

Why would you want to do this?
The main reason is as a regression test when moving up to new versions of the framework; you can check that the metamodel built up by the next version is the same as the previous.


== Introspection

A number of new configuration properties are available to control how introspection (the building of the framework's internal metamodel) is performed:

* parallelized introspection
** specify `isis.reflector.introspector.parallelize`
** is enabled by default

* lazy introspection
** specify `isis.reflector.introspector.mode`
** is set to `lazy_unless_production` by default, can switch to `lazy` or `full`
