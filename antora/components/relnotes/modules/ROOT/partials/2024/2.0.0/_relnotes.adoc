Other highlights

* xref:pjpa:ROOT:about.adoc[Persistence using JPA] has been added through an integration of EclipseLink.
+
xref:pjdo::about.adoc[Persistence using JDO] continues to be supported through the integration with DataNucleus.
+
[NOTE]
====
We use EclipseLink rather than Hibernate because the latter is licensed using LGPL, which is incompatible with ASF licensing.
In addition, EclipseLink is the reference implementation for JPA.
====

+
Spring Data is supported for both persistence mechanisms.

* multiple mechanisms of implementing view models (JAXB, programmatic, serializable).
This is pluggable.

* added a generic xref:gqlv:ROOT:about.adoc[GraphQL] API.

* multiple improvements to the programming model, including:

** support for meta-annotations

** support for different introspection modes.
+
In particular, "encapsulated" mode mean that the properties and collections of entities and view models do _not_ have to have `public` visibility; their programmatic API can be kept to a minimum.

** supported custom scalar value types and composite types
+
This includes xref:valuetypes:asciidoc:about.adoc[AsciiDoc], xref:valuetypes:markdown:about.adoc[Markdown], xref:valuetypes:jodatime:about.adoc[Jodatime] and xref:valuetypes:vega:about.adoc[Vega]
(link:https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/[Vega-lite], "a grammar of interactive graphics").


** mixin classes annotated as `@Action`, `@Property` or `@Collection`

** logical type name aliases

* integration extensions, including xref:userguide:commandlog:about.adoc[], xref:userguide:executionlog:about.adoc[] and xref:userguide:executionoutbox:about.adoc[]

* xref:vw:ROOT:about.adoc[] extensions including xref:vw:fullcalendar:about.adoc[], xref:vw:pdfjs:about.adoc[], xref:vw:tabular:about.adoc[Tabular Extension] (Excel).
+
Also tree view and client-side filtering using datatables.net JS.

* security extensions including  xref:security:secman:about.adoc[secman] ( authorization and/or authentication implemented as Causeway entities), xref:security:audittrail:about.adoc[Audit Trail] and xref:security:sessionlog:about.adoc[Session Log]

* dependency/library upgrades:

** Spring event bus replaces guava or axon; removes guice

** ByteBuddy replaces cglib or javassist for implementation of xref:refguide:applib:index/services/wrapper/WrapperFactory.adoc[]

** switch from hsqldb to h2

* other extensions such as a xref:refguide:extensions:index/commandlog/applib/dom/BackgroundService.adoc[BackgroundService] for executing commands asynchronously, and xref:userguide:flyway:about.adoc[] integration.

Apart from dependencies and the `javax`/`jakarta` namespace, in most regards v2.0.0 and v3.0 are functionally equivalent.
The only feature not available in 3.0 is the Shiro module, because (at the time of release) Apache Shiro have not released `jakarta` support.
However, either the xref:security:spring:about.adoc[Spring Security] integration or even the xref:security:simple:about.adoc[Simple Security] implementation can be used instead.
