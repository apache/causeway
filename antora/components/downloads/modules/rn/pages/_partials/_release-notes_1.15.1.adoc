This is primarily a bug fix release.
Notable fixes include upgrading to Wicket 7.9.0 (to address a link:https://www.mail-archive.com/dev@wicket.apache.org/msg16967.html[major page store issue]), and a fix for the Wicket viewer's reference panel with choices.

The release also has some minor new features: a new Markup value type that allows arbitrary HTML to be rendered in the Wicket viewer, an extension to Restful Objects to provide a new "layout" resource, and a new "logout" page for Wicket viewer to support monitoring tools.


== New Feature

* link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ISIS-1696[ISIS-1696] - Extend RO viewer so that services indicate their menuBar (primary/secondary) as an extension
* link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ISIS-1616[ISIS-1616] - Support URLs as a link / "As-is" HTML rendering
* link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ISIS-571[ISIS-571] - [WON'T FIX] To (hopefully) improve performance, use Render.EAGERLY as a hint to instruct JDO to eagerly load the collection (using a dynamic fetch group).
