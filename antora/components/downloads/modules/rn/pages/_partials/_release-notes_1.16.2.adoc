This release is primarily a bug fix release fixing one severe error relating to parented checkboxes (link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ISIS-1874[ISIS-1874]).
It does however introduce one new feature for the REST API (RO viewer) to support generic RO clients.
There is also one notable performance improvement through the caching of ``JAXBContext``s.

* link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ISIS-1879[ISIS-1879] - Date header returned by RO resuts should be the Clock time, not the system time.
