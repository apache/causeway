== Filter classes/interfaces

Also, all classes and interfaces in `org.apache.isis.applib.filter` have been removed.
Instead, the `java.util.Predicate<T>` interface is used.

For example, `RepositoryService#allMatches(...)` method, which allows client-side filtering of results (typically during prototyping), now has the signature:

[source,java]
----
public interface RepositoryService {
    ...
    <T> List<T> allMatches(
                    final Class<T> ofType,
                    final Predicate<? super T> predicate,
                    long... range);

}
