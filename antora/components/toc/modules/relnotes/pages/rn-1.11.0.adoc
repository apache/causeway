The main focus for Apache Isis 1.11.0 is on the REST API and on view models using JAXB:

* the link:https://isis.apache.org/versions/1.11.0/guides/ugvro/ugvro.html#[Restful Objects viewer] now supports simplified
representations intended to make it easier to write custom Javascript (and other) clients that consume the REST API;
these are obtained using the HTTP Accept header.  There is also support for link:http://swagger.io[Swagger] spec files
so that the REST API can be more easily explored and tested. +
+
In addition, the `x-ro-follow-links` capability for RO spec representations is now supported.

* JAXB-annotated classes are now recognised as view models; these also enable the contents
collections to be part of the view model's state (previously only view model properties were recognised).  The new
UrlEncodingService allows long URLs (for view models) to be converted into shorter URLs; this also allows the URL
to optionally be encrypted.

The release also includes improved control for domain events (these can now be suppressed if required) , and a new
category of UI events (so that titles, icons and CSS classes can be provided by event bus subscribers).
