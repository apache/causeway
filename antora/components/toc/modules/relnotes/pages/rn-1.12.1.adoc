Apache Isis 1.12.1 is a bug fix release for Apache Isis 1.12.0.  The primary issue it addresses are spurious concurrency exceptions that can be thrown when editing an object.  It also addresses a subtle issue where the new support in JAXB view models for auto-edit can cause some dirty objects not to be updated.
