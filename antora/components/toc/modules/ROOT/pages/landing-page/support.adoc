== Releases

It's usually easiest to work with the xref:starters:ROOT:about.adoc[starter apps].
But you can also download the framework and built it yourself:

* xref:toc:ROOT:downloads/how-to.adoc[Downloads]

Each new version of the framework updates the release notes (which includes migration notes):

* xref:relnotes:ROOT:about.adoc[Release Notes]

If you want to live on the bleeding edge, you can also use the nightly builds (not ASF):

* link:https://github.com/apache-isis-committers/isis-nightly[CI]
* link:https://repo.incode.cloud/[Maven Repo]
* link:https://apache-isis-committers.github.io/isis-nightly/toc/about.html[Website preview]
