To get started with a new application, use one of the two git repos on Github that provide a starter app.

* link:https://github.com/apache/isis-app-helloworld[HelloWorld]
+
This is a very minimal app, intended just as a starting point to learn what the framework is all about.

* link:https://github.com/apache/isis-app-simpleapp[Simple App]
+
This app has the same functionality as _HelloWorld_, but is structured so it can be used as a starting point for developing your own applications.
+
It also includes some xref:testing:integ-test-support[integration tests], xref:testing:fixtures:about.adoc[fixtures], and xref:testing:spec-support[BDD (Cucumber)] specs.
