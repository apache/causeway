// TODO: V2: need to update these, they are getting stale.

link:http://www.gesconsultor.com[GESCONSULTOR] GRC (currently SandaS GRC) is an IT Governance, Risk and Compliance
platform to help companies be compliant with IT-related ISO Standards, laws, regulations and best practices.  Its scope
includes:

* ISO 27001 for Information Security Management Systems,
* ISO 22301 for Business Continuity Management Systems,
* ISO 20000 for IT Service Management Systems,
* PCI-DSS regulation for Information Systems accessing electronic media payment Information,
* COBIT standard from ISACA,
* Critical Infrastructure Protection laws,
* Data Privacy laws of many countries.

With thousands of customers of some of its modules, the application needed to support many business requirements
derived from previous requisite sources and also from many Authoritative Sources loaded by users.

In 2011 a major rearchitecting was begun, and Apache Isis was selected as the best solution - among all Java frameworks
and platforms evaluated - for supporting those business rules in a domain-focused way.

Following the principles of Domain-Driven Design for the domain layer, and with the infrastructure layer isolated by
the Apache Isis framework, the new system started to grow in a highly structured and maintainable way.  New modules
were created really quickly, with functionality not available on competing solutions.

The application also leveraged the flexibility of the framework, replacing the provided Wicket viewer with a custom
viewer.  More on this below.


== Key features

=== Enterprise Architecture

Allows a company to model its _Business_, __IT Asset__s and their dependencies.  The custom viewer in this case exposes a
classical form-like interface:

Alternatively, a custom drag-n-drop visual interface can be used:

This is implemented with the Dojo javascript library, interfacing to Apache Isis-managed domain objects.



=== Risk Management

Allows a company to manage __Risk Scenario__s through a _Risk Register_, and execute a full ISO 31000 compliant _Risk Assessment_.
A custom UI visualizes these risks as a heatmap:

=== Project Management

Allows users to visually manage their projects and tasks through a KanBan-like interface.
Again, the viewer provides drag-n-drop capabilities:

=== Dashboard and Indicators

Being a "world-first", the GRC platform's implementation of the Information Security measurement standard (ISO 27004) allows companies to access real-time information available in the GRC platform and External Systems, associate _Decision Criteria_ to them and create beautiful __Dashboard__s and __Indicator__s.

All the business rules are on a Domain fully implemented in Apache Isis.


== Implementation details

The GRC application require a more sophisticating and customizable viewer than is provided "out-of-the-box" by Apache Isis.
We chose http://wavemaker.com[Wavemaker] for implementing the viewer, also leveraging and integrating with various Wavemaker services.

Even so, while GRC does (as the figures above show) include custom views, the majority of the views exposed by GRC are automatically generated from the underlying domain entities; the GRC viewer is a proprietary version of Isis' own xref:vw:ROOT:about.adoc[Wicket viewer].
At the last count more than 400 domain entities, across 6 different Bounded Contexts, are surfaced in the UI in this this way.

At the Domain level, we also extensively use the xref:userguide:fun:building-blocks.adoc#domain-events[domain events] functionality available in Apache Isis, along with many of the (non-ASF) link:https://platform.incode.org[Incode Platform^] (such as audit, security and excel modules).

The GRC platform currently has more than 5600 automated tests, about 2000 being xref:testing:specsupport:about.adoc[BDD tests] and 3600 xref:testing:integtestsupport:about.adoc[integration tests], all leveraging Apache Isis' extensive testing capabilities.


== Summing up

Three years after this major refactoring, the GRC platform was acquired by Telefonica to be used as its top-level Security Governance platform; a breakthrough in the Managed Security Services sector.

The original development team currently work on Telefonica offices; the Product Management is co-directed by the link:http://www.govertis.com[GOVERTIS company] that originally developed it, and Telefonica.

All this could not have been achieved as quickly nor as effectively without the Apache Isis platform.
