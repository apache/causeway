Represents the location in the user interface where a class member is to be rendered.

Used to control visibility (eg using the _Property#hidden()_ annotation) and enablement (eg using the _Property#editing()_ annotation) in different regions of the user interface.

The application programmer may use any of the values of this enum. Some represent concrete locations (eg _#OBJECT_FORMS_ , _#PARENTED_TABLES_ ), whereas some represent a combination of locations (eg _#ALL_TABLES_ , _#ANYWHERE_ ).

== Members

[#EVERYWHERE]
=== EVERYWHERE

The member should be disabled/hidden everywhere.

Synonym for _#ANYWHERE_ .

[#ANYWHERE]
=== ANYWHERE

The member should be disabled/hidden everywhere.

Synonym for _#EVERYWHERE_ .

[#OBJECT_FORMS]
=== OBJECT_FORMS

The member should be disabled/hidden when displayed within an object form.

For most viewers, this applies to property and collection members, not actions.

[#REFERENCES_PARENT]
=== REFERENCES_PARENT

The (property) member should be hidden when displayed as a column of a table within parent object's collection, and when it references that parent.

[#PARENTED_TABLES]
=== PARENTED_TABLES

The member should be hidden when displayed as a column of a table within a parent object's collection.

An alternative to using annotations is using to use file based layout, which can be reloaded dynamically. One implementation that supports this is `TableColumnOrderServiceUsingTxtFile` service, that reads from files named _ParentClass#collectionId.columnOrder.txt_ .

[#STANDALONE_TABLES]
=== STANDALONE_TABLES

The member should be hidden when displayed as a column of a table showing a standalone list of objects, for example as returned by a repository query.

An alternative to using annotations is using to use file based layout, which can be reloaded dynamically. One implementation that supports this is `TableColumnOrderServiceUsingTxtFile` service, that reads from files named _ClassName.columnOrder.txt_ .

[#ALL_TABLES]
=== ALL_TABLES

The member should be disabled/hidden when displayed as a column of a table, either an object's collection or a standalone list.

This combines _#PARENTED_TABLES_ and _#STANDALONE_TABLES_ .

An alternative to using annotations is using to use file based layout, which can be reloaded dynamically. One implementation that supports this is `TableColumnOrderServiceUsingTxtFile` service, that reads from files named _ParentClass#collectionId.columnOrder.txt_ (parented collections) and _ClassName.columnOrder.txt_ (standalone collections).

[#ALL_EXCEPT_STANDALONE_TABLES]
=== ALL_EXCEPT_STANDALONE_TABLES

The member should be disabled/hidden except when displayed as a column of a standalone table.

This is the inverse of _#STANDALONE_TABLES_ .

[#NOWHERE]
=== NOWHERE

To act as an override if a member would normally be hidden as a result of some other convention.

For example, if a property is annotated with `@Title` , then normally this should be hidden from all tables. Additionally annotating with `@Hidden(where=Where.NOWHERE)` overrides this.

[#NOT_SPECIFIED]
=== NOT_SPECIFIED

Acts as the default no-op value for _PropertyLayout#hidden()_ , _CollectionLayout#hidden()_ and _ActionLayout#hidden()_ .

[#includes__Where]
=== includes(Where)

Whether this `Where` is a superset of the context `Where` provided.

For example, _#ALL_TABLES_ includes _#STANDALONE_TABLES_ ; _#ANYWHERE_ includes all others.
