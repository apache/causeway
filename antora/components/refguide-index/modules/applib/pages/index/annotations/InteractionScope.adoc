_@InteractionScope_ is a specialization of _Scope @Scope_ for a component whose lifecycle is bound to the current top-level Interaction, in other words that it is private to the "current user".

Specifically, _@InteractionScope_ is a *composed annotation* that acts as a shortcut for _@Scope("interaction")_ .

_@InteractionScope_ may be used as a meta-annotation to create custom composed annotations.
