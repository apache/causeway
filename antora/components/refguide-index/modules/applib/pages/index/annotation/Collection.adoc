[#domainEvent]
=== domainEvent

Indicates that changes to the collection that should be posted to the _org.apache.causeway.applib.services.eventbus.EventBusService event bus_ using a custom (subclass of) xref:refguide:applib:index/events/domain/CollectionDomainEvent.adoc[CollectionDomainEvent] .

Subscribers of this event can interact with the business rule checking (hide, disable, validate) and its modification (before and after).

For example:

----

public class Order {
  public static class OrderLineItems extends CollectionDomainEvent { ... }

  @CollectionInteraction(OrderLineItems.class)
  public SortedSet<OrderLine> getLineItems() { ...}
}
----

This subclass must provide a no-arg constructor; the fields are set reflectively.

[#typeOf]
=== typeOf

The type-of the elements held within the collection.

This is only provided as a fallback; usually the framework can infer the element type of the collection from the collection method's generic type.
