The xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/PropertyLayout.adoc#typicalLength[typicalLength()] element indicates the typical length of a string property.
It is ignored for properties of other types.

The information is intended as a hint to the UI to determine the space that should be given to render a particular string property.


For example:

[source,java]
----
import jakarta.persistence.Column;
import lombok.Getter;
import lombok.Setter;

public class Customer {

    @Column(length=30)
    @ParameterLayout(typicalLength=20)
    @Getter @Setter
    private String firstName;

    // ...
}
----

NOTE: All that said, the xref:vw:ROOT:about.adoc[Web UI (Wicket viewer)] uses the maximum space available for all fields, so in effect ignores this element.
