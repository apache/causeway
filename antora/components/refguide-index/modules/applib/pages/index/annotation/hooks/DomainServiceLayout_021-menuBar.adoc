The xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/DomainServiceLayout.adoc#menuBar[menuBar()] element is a hint to specify where on the application menu a domain service's actions should be rendered.

For example:

[source,java]
----
@DomainService
@DomainServiceLayout(menuBar=MenuBar.PRIMARY)
public class ToDoItems {
    ...
}
----

In the xref:vw:ROOT:about.adoc[Web UI (Wicket viewer)], domain services placed:

* on the `PRIMARY` menu bar appears to the left.
* on the `SECONDARY` menu bar appear to the right:
* on the `TERTIARY` appear in the menu bar associated with the user's name (far top-right)

The grouping of multiple domain services actions within a single drop-down is managed by the `@jakarta.annotation.Priority` annotation.

NOTE: The xref:vro:ROOT:about.adoc[RestfulObjects viewer] does not support this attribute.

==== Alternatives

Alternatively, use `menubars.layout.xml` layout file to organize menu action items arbitrarily.
