=== logicalTypeName

The logical name of this object's type, that uniquely and fully qualifies it. The logical name is analogous to - but independent of - the actual fully qualified class name. eg. _sales.CustomerService_ for a class 'org.mycompany.services.CustomerService'

This value, if specified, is used in the serialized form of the object's xref:refguide:applib:index/services/bookmark/Bookmark.adoc[Bookmark] . A xref:refguide:applib:index/services/bookmark/Bookmark.adoc[Bookmark] is used by the framework to uniquely identify an object over time (same concept as a URN). Otherwise, if not specified, the fully qualified class name is used instead.
