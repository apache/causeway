[#NOT_SPECIFIED]
=== NOT_SPECIFIED

The default; allows the programmer to combine `@DomainObject` annotation with the xref:refguide:applib:index/ViewModel.adoc[ViewModel] annotation, or the _XmlRootElement_ annotation, or by implementing the xref:refguide:applib:index/ViewModel.adoc[ViewModel] interface.

[#ENTITY]
=== ENTITY

A domain entity whose persistence is managed by Causeway using the configured object store, eg JPA/EclipseLink.

Domain entities are considered to be part of the domain model layer.

Currently implies no additional semantics other than documentation.

[#VIEW_MODEL]
=== VIEW_MODEL

An object that is conceptually part of the application layer, and which surfaces behavior and/or state that is aggregate of one or more domain entity.

The identity of a view model is determined solely by the state of object's properties. Using this nature should be considered exactly equivalent to annotating with xref:refguide:applib:index/ViewModel.adoc[ViewModel] .

Note that collections are ignored; if their state is required to fully identify the view model, define the view model using the JAXB _XmlRootElement_ annotation instead (where the object's state is serialized to an arbitrarily deep graph of data, with references to persistent entities transparently resolved to `<oid-dto>` elements).

[#MIXIN]
=== MIXIN

An object that acts as a mix-in to some other object, contributing behavior and/or derived state based on the domain object.

[#BEAN]
=== BEAN

An object that is entirely managed by the underlying IoC container.

Some possible use cases for this are:

* As a helper service that is used to emit messages through _Action#executionPublishing()_ .
+
--
The service itself isn't rendered anywhere, but its actions can be invoked through the _org.apache.causeway.applib.services.wrapper.WrapperFactory_ . (Or as a variant, it might expose a xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/Programmatic.adoc[Programmatic] API and then delegate to its own action via the _org.apache.causeway.applib.services.wrapper.WrapperFactory_ .
--
* As a service representing a facade to a module, so that code in another (untrusted) module can only execute through xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/Action.adoc[Action] s
+
--
Again, either the calling module is expected to use the _org.apache.causeway.applib.services.wrapper.WrapperFactory_ when invoking the facade service, or - since the calling code is treated untrusted - then the same self-delegation approach as for the previous example could be used, whereby the facade service exposes a xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/Programmatic.adoc[Programmatic] API and then delegates to its own action via the _org.apache.causeway.applib.services.wrapper.WrapperFactory_ .
--

 *IMPORTANT* the class must _also_ be annotated with an appropriate _org.springframework.context.annotation.Scope_ , eg `@Scope("singleton")` or `@Scope("prototype")`
