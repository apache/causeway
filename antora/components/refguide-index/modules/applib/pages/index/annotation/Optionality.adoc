== Members

[#DEFAULT]
=== DEFAULT

Default, usually meaning mandatory for properties and always meaning mandatory for parameters.

For properties, will be false unless JPA _Column_ has also specified with _Column#nullable()_ set to `true` .

[#OPTIONAL]
=== OPTIONAL

Indicates that the property or parameter is not required.

[#MANDATORY]
=== MANDATORY

Indicates that the property is required (even if the JPA _jakarta.persistence.Column_ annotation says otherwise).

When using the JPA/EclipseLink objectstore, it is sometimes necessary to annotate a property as optional (using _Column#nullable()_ set to `true` ), even if the property is logically mandatory. For example, this can occur when the property is in a subtype class that has been "rolled up" to the superclass table using _jakarta.persistence.Inheritance_ strategy of _jakarta.persistence.InheritanceType#SINGLE_TABLE_

This annotation, therefore, is intended to override any objectstore-specific annotation, so that Causeway can apply the constraint even though the objectstore is unable to do so.

[#NOT_SPECIFIED]
=== NOT_SPECIFIED

Ignore the value provided by this annotation (meaning that the framework will keep searching, in meta annotations or superclasses/interfaces).
