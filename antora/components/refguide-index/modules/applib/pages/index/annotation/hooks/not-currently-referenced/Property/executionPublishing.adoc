CAUTION: TODO: v2 - publishing/auditing got a complete overhaul

The `executionPublishing` attribute determines whether and how a property edit is published via the registered implementation of xref:refguide:applib:index/services/publishing/spi/ExecutionSubscriber.adoc[`ExecutionSubscriber`].

A common use case is to notify external "downstream" systems of changes in the state of the Apache Isis application.
The default value for the attribute is `AS_CONFIGURED`, meaning that the xref:refguide:config:sections/isis.applib.adoc#isis.applib.annotation.property.executionPublishing[`isis.applib.annotation.property.executionPublishing`] configuration property is used to determine the whether the property edits are published:

* `all`
+
all property edits are published

* `none`
+
no property edits are published

If there is no configuration property in `application.properties` then publishing is automatically enabled.

This default can be overridden on an property-by-property basis; if `executionPublishing()` is set to `ENABLED` then the property edit is published irrespective of the configured value; if set to `DISABLED` then the property edit is _not_ published, again irrespective of the configured value.

For example:

[source,java]
----
import lombok.Getter;
import lombok.Setter;

public class Order {

    @Property(executionPublishing=Publishing.ENABLED)    // <.>
    @Getter @Setter
    private int quantity;

    // ...
}
----
<.> because set to enabled, will be published irrespective of the configured value.

This attribute can also be specified for:

* xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/DomainObject.adoc#publishing[domain objects]
+
where it controls whether changed objects are published as events, and for

* xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/Action.adoc#executionPublishing[actions]
+
where it controls whether action invocations are published as events.
