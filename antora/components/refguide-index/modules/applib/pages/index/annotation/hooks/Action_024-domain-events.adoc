=== Domain events

Whenever a domain object (or list of domain objects) is to be rendered, the framework fires off multiple domain events for every property, collection and action of the domain object.
In the cases of the domain object's actions, the events that are fired are:

* hide phase: to check that the action is visible (has not been hidden)
* disable phase: to check that the action is usable (has not been disabled)
* validate phase: to check that the action's arguments are valid
* pre-execute phase: before the invocation of the action
* post-execute: after the invocation of the action

Subscribers subscribe through the xref:refguide:applib:index/services/eventbus/EventBusService.adoc[`EventBusService`] and can influence each of these phases.

By default the event raised is `ActionDomainEvent.Default`.
For example:

[source,java]
----
public class ToDoItem {

    @Action()
    public ToDoItem completed() {
        // ...
    }
    ...
}
----

The xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/Action.adoc#domainEvent[domainEvent()] element allows a custom subclass to be emitted allowing more precise subscriptions (to those subclasses) to be defined instead.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class ToDoItem {
    public static class CompletedEvent extends ActionDomainEvent<ToDoItem> { }  // <1>
    @Action(domainEvent=CompletedEvent.class)
    public ToDoItem completed() { /* ... */ }
}
----

The benefit is that subscribers can be more targeted as to the events that they subscribe to.

[NOTE]
====
The framework provides a no-arg constructor and will initialize the domain event using (non-API) setters rather than through the constructor.
This substantially reduces the boilerplate required in subclasses because no explicit constructor is required.
====

==== Subscribers

Subscribers (which must be domain services) subscribe to events posted through the xref:refguide:applib:index/services/eventbus/EventBusService.adoc[`EventBusService`].

Subscribers can be either coarse-grained (if they subscribe to the top-level event type):

[source,java]
----
import org.springframework.context.event.EventListener;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class SomeSubscriber {
    @EventListener(ActionDomainEvent.class)
    public void on(ActionDomainEvent ev) {
        ...
    }
}
----

or can be fine-grained (by subscribing to specific event subtypes):

[source,java]
----
import org.springframework.context.event.EventListener;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class SomeSubscriber {
    @EventListener(ToDoItem.CompletedEvent.class)
    public void on(ToDoItem.CompletedEvent ev) {
        ...
    }
}
----

The subscriber's method is called (up to) 5 times:

* whether to veto visibility (hide)
* whether to veto usability (disable)
* whether to veto execution (validate)
* steps to perform prior to the action being invoked
* steps to perform after the action has been invoked

The subscriber can distinguish these by calling `ev.getEventPhase()`.
Thus the general form is:

[source,java]
----
import org.springframework.context.event.EventListener;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class SomeSubscriber {

    @EventListener(ActionDomainEvent.class)
    public void on(ActionDomainEvent ev) {
        switch(ev.getEventPhase()) {

            case HIDE:                      // <.>
                break;
            case DISABLE:                   // <.>
                break;
            case VALIDATE:                  // <.>
                break;

            case EXECUTING:
                break;
            case EXECUTED:
                break;
        }
    }
}
----

<.> call `ev.hide()` or `ev.veto("")` to hide the action
<.> call `ev.disable("...")` or `ev.veto("...")` to disable the action
<.> call ev.invalidate("...") or ev.veto("...") if action arguments are invalid

It is also possible to abort the transaction during the executing or executed phases by throwing an exception.
If the exception is a subtype of `RecoverableException` then the exception will be rendered as a user-friendly warning (eg Growl/toast) rather than an error.

==== Default, Doop and Noop events

If the xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/Action.adoc#domainEvent[domainEvent()] element is not explicitly specified (is left as its default value, `ActionDomainEvent.Default`), then the framework will, by default, post an event.

If this is not required, then the xref:config:sections/isis.applib.adoc#isis.applib.annotation.action.domain-event.post-for-default[isis.applib.annotation.action.domain-event.post-for-default] configuration property can be set to "false"; this will disable posting.

On the other hand, if the `domainEvent` has been explicitly specified to some subclass, then an event will be posted.
The framework provides `ActionDomainEvent.Doop` as such a subclass, so setting the `domainEvent` element to this class will ensure that the event to be posted, irrespective of the configuration property setting.

And, conversely, the framework also provides `ActionDomainEvent.Noop`; if `domainEvent` element is set to this class, then no event will be posted.

==== Class-level default

Sometimes a subscriber is interested in all of the actions of a given class, though not any individual action.
A common use case is to hide or disable all actions for some particular object for some particular user group.

For this use, the default action domain event can be annotated using `@DomainObject`:

[source,java]
----
@DomainObject(
    actionDomainEvent=ToDoItem.ActionDomainEvent.class
)
public class ToDoItem {
    public static class ActionDomainEvent extends
        org.apache.isis.applib.events.domain.ActionDomainEvent<Object> { }
    // ...

    public void updateDescription(final String description) {
        this.description = description;
    }
}
----


==== Raising events programmatically

Normally events are only raised for interactions through the UI.
However, events can be raised programmatically either by calling the xref:refguide:applib:index/services/eventbus/EventBusService.adoc[EventBusService] API directly, or by emulating the UI by wrapping the target object using the xref:refguide:applib:index/services/wrapper/WrapperFactory.adoc[WrapperFactory] domain service.
