The xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/CollectionLayout.adoc#describedAs[describedAs()] element is used to provide a short description of the collection to the user.
In the xref:vw:ROOT:about.adoc[Web UI (Wicket viewer)] it is displayed as a 'tool tip'.

For example:

[source,java]
----
import lombok.Getter;
import lombok.Setter;

public class ToDoItem {

    @CollectionLayout(
        describedAs = "Todo items to be completed before this one"
    )
    @Getter @Setter
    private SortedSet<ToDoItem> dependencies = ...

}
