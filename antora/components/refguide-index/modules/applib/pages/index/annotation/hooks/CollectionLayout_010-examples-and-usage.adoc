== Examples

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class ToDoItem {
    @CollectionLayout(
        cssClass="x-key",
        named="Todo items that are <i>dependencies</i> of this item.",
        namedEscaped=false,
        describedAs="Other todo items that must be completed before this one",
        labelPosition=LabelPosition.LEFT,
        render=EAGERLY)
    public SortedSet<ToDoItem> getDependencies() { /* ... */ }
    ...
}
----

[TIP]
====
As an alternative to using the `@CollectionLayout` annotation, a xref:userguide:fun:ui.adoc#object-layout[file-based layout] can be used (and is generally to be preferred since it is more flexible/powerful).
====

[TIP]
====
The annotation is one of a handful (others including xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/Collection.adoc[`@Collection`], xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/Property.adoc[`@Property`] and xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/PropertyLayout.adoc[`@PropertyLayout`]) that can also be applied to the field, rather than the getter method.
This is specifically so that boilerplate-busting tools such as link:https://projectlombok.org/[Project Lombok] can be used.
