The `named` attribute explicitly specifies the action parameter's name.

In most cases -- so long as the `--parameters` compile flag is passed to javac -- then this attribute is not required.

[TIP]
====
We recommend that you only use this attribute when the desired name cannot be used in Java source code.
Examples of that include a name that would be a reserved Java keyword (eg "package"), or a name that has punctuation, eg apostrophes.
====

By default the name is HTML escaped.
To allow HTML markup, set the related `namedEscaped` attribute to `false`.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {
    public Order placeOrder(
            final Product product,
            @ParameterLayout(named="Package ?")
            final boolean packageUp) {
        Order order = Order.forCustomer(this)
                           .ofProduct(product)
                           .withPackage(packageUp);
        return repository.persistAndFlush(order);
    }
    ...
}

[TIP]
====
The framework also provides a separate, powerful mechanism for xref:userguide:btb:i18n.adoc[internationalization].
