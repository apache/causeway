The xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/Parameter.adoc#maxLength[maxLength] ellement applies only to `String` parameters, indicating the maximum number of characters that the user may enter (for example in a text field in the UI).
It is ignored if applied to parameters of any other type.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class CustomerRepository {
    public Customer newCustomer(
        @Parameter(maxLength=30)
        final String firstName,
        @Parameter(maxLength=50)
        final String lastName) {
        ...
    }
}
