The xref:applib:index/annotation/Property.adoc#editing[editing()] element can be used to prevent a property from being modified or cleared, ie to make it read-only.

The related xref:applib:index/annotation/Property.adoc#editingDisabledReason[editingDisabledReason()] element specifies a hard-coded reason why the property cannot be modified directly.

Whether a property is enabled or disabled depends upon these factors:

* whether the domain object has been configured as immutable through the xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/DomainObject.adoc#editing[@DomainObject#editing()] element

* else (that is, if the domain object's editability is specified as being `AS_CONFIGURED`), then the value of the xref:refguide:config:sections/isis.applib.adoc#isis.applib.annotation.domain-object.editing['isis.applib.annotation.domain-object.editing'] configuration property.
+
If set to `false`, then the object's properties (and collections) are __not__ editable

* else, the value of the `@Property(editing=...)` attribute itself

* else, the result of invoking any supporting xref:refguide:applib-methods:prefixes.adoc#disable[`disable...()`] supporting methods


Thus, to make a property read-only even if the object would otherwise be editable, use:
