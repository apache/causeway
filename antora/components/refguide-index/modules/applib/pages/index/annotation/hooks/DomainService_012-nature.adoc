The xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/DomainService.adoc#nature[nature] element indicates the intent of the actions defined within the domain service:

* `VIEW`
+
The default; the service's actions appear on menu bars, can be contributed, appear in the REST API

* `REST`
+
The service's actions are intended only to be listed in the REST API exposed by the xref:vro:ROOT:about.adoc[RestfulObjects viewer].

The actual class name of the domain service is only rendered for the `VIEW` natures.

For example:

[source,java]
----
@DomainService( nature=NatureOfService.VIEW )
@RequiredArgsConstructor(onConstructor_ = {@Inject} )
public class Loans {                                   // <.>

    private final LoanRepository loanRepository;       // <.>

    @Action(semantics=SemanticsOf.SAFE)
    public List<Loan> findOverdueLoans() {
        // ...
    }
}
----
<.> name is intended to be rendered in the UI
<.> it's common for domain-layer domain services to be injected into presentation layer services.


For services that do not need to appear in the UI and do not need to be invoked using xref:refguide:applib:index/services/wrapper/WrapperFactory.adoc[WrapperFactory] (in other words, do not need to be part of the metamodel), you can declare the service using Spring's `@Service`, `@Repository` or `@Component` annotations.

For example:

[source,java]
----
@Repository
public class LoanRepository {
    public List<Loan> findLoansFor(Borrower borrower) {
        // ...
    }
}
----
