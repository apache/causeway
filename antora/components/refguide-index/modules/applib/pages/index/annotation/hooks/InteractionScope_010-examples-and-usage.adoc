// TODO: v2 - this may no longer be true.

//A number of the built-in domain services uses this annotation, including xref:refguide:applib:index/services/scratchpad/Scratchpad.adoc[`Scratchpad`] and
//xref:refguide:applib:index/services/queryresultscache/QueryResultsCache.adoc[`QueryResultsCache`].
//
//One small wrinkle: these session-scoped services must be injected using the `Provider` idiom, not directly.
//For example:
//
//[source,java]
//----
//@DomainService
//public class SomeRepository {
//    // ...
//    @Inject
//    Provider<QueryResultsCache> queryResultsCacheProvider;
//}
//----
//
//If the session-scoped service is accidentally injected directly, then the framework will fail-fast with a suitable error message.
//
