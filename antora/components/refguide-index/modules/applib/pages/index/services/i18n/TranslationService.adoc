Provides translated versions of the various elements within the framework's metamodel: service and object classes, properties, collections, actions, action parameters; and also to translate business rule (disable/valid) messages, and exceptions. These translations provide for both singular and plural forms.

As such, this domain service is the cornerstone of the framework's i18n support.

[#translate__TranslationContext_String]
=== translate(TranslationContext, String)

Return a translation of the text, in the locale of the "current user".

The mechanism to determine the locale is implementation-specific.

[#translate__TranslationContext_String_String_int]
=== translate(TranslationContext, String, String, int)

Return a translation of either the singular or the plural text, dependent on the `num` parameter, in the locale of the "current user".

The mechanism to determine the locale is implementation-specific.

[#getMode__]
=== getMode()

Whether this implementation is operating in read or in write mode.

If in read mode, then the translations are expected to be present. In such cases, the _#translate(TranslationContext, String) translate_ _#translate(TranslationContext, String, String, int) method_ s should be _lazily_ called, if only because there will (most likely) need to be a session in progress (such that the locale of the current user can be determined).

If in write mode, then the implementation is saving translation keys, and will always return the untranslated translation. In such cases, the _#translate(TranslationContext, String) translate_ _#translate(TranslationContext, String, String, int) method_ s should be _eagerly_ called such that all pathways are exercised..
