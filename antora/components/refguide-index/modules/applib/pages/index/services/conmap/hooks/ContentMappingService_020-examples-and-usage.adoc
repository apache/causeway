== Usage

The `ContentMappingService` supports the (default implementation of the) internal xref:refguide:viewer:index/restfulobjects/rendering/service/conneg/ContentNegotiationService.adoc[ContentNegotiationService] SPI enabling the xref:vro:ROOT:about.adoc[RestfulObjects viewer] to represent domain objects in some other format as specified by the HTTP `Accept` header.

For its part, the (default implementation of the) `ContentNegotiationService` will check _all_ available implementations of `ContentMappingService` to convert the domain object to the requested media type, rather than merely the first implementation found; in other words it uses the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain-of-responsibility_pattern[chain-of-responsibility] pattern.
Services are checked in the ordering defined by the `@jakarta.annotation.Priority` annotation.
The mapped object used will be the first (= earlies encountered) non-`null` result returned by an implementation.


== Related Services

This service is a companion to the default implementation of the xref:refguide:viewer:index/restfulobjects/rendering/service/conneg/ContentNegotiationService.adoc[ContentNegotiationService].

The framework implementations of `ContentMappingService` use the xref:refguide:applib:index/services/metamodel/MetaModelService.adoc[MetaModelService] to lookup any custom implementations of `CommandDtoProcessor`.
