Optional SPI to provide an equivalent identifier using only ASCII character set, for the specified feature (a property, collection, action or action parameter).

The GraphQL API (viewer) may require this SPI to be implemented if any of the features use non-ASCII characters, because feature Ids are used as GraphQL (field) names.
