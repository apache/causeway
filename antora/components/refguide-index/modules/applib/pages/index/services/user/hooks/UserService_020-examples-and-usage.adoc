== Usage by Framework

The roles associated with the `UserMemento` will be based on the configured xref:security:ROOT:about.adoc[security] (typically Shiro).

In addition, when using the xref:vw:ROOT:about.adoc[Web UI (Wicket viewer)] there will be an additional "org.apache.isis.viewer.wicket.roles.USER" role; this is used internally to restrict access to web pages without authenticating.
