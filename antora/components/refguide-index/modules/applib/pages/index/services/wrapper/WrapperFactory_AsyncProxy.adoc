The result of an async proxy instantiation, that allows to submit an async invocation on the wrapped domain object.

The framework takes care, that an async invocation is scoped within both an interaction-context and a transaction. Further more, _TryFuture_ 's success values are unwrapped and detached.

Terminology:

* interaction-context: who/how/when xref:refguide:applib:index/services/iactnlayer/InteractionContext.adoc[InteractionContext]
* unwrapped: plain object, not proxied _WrapperFactory#unwrap_
* detached: object not attached to a persistence session (applicable to entities only) _RepositoryService#detach(Object)_
