=== process(Object, CommandDto)

Converts the domain object (acting as the source) into a _CommandDto_ .

The _CommandDto_ that is also passed into the method will be from a default implementation provided by the framework. Most implementations will typically refine this provided DTO and return, for example adding additional user metadata to _CommandDto#getUserData()_ .
