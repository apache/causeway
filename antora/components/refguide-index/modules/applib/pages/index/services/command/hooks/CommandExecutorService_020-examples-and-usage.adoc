== Usage

The `CommandExecutorService` domain service is provides the ability to execute a specified `Command`, optionally running the command with the identity of the user captured in that `Command`.


// TODO - v2 this is out of date; reference the command-replay service, now part of framework.

//In fact, the service requires that the implementation of the `Command` being executed implements the `CommandWithDto` sub-interface.
//This allows the xref:refguide:schema:cmd.adoc[CommandDto] memento to be extracted, from which the action can be invoked/property edited.
//
//The primary use case for this service is to allow the replay of commands, eg for regression testing.
//This is implemented by the (non-ASF) link:https://platform.incode.org/modules/spi/command/spi-command-replay.html[command replay module].
//(The command replay module also provides a decorator implementation of this service that allows the command to be re-executed at the same _time_ as the original command, leveraging the `TickingClock` implementation provided by the framework).
