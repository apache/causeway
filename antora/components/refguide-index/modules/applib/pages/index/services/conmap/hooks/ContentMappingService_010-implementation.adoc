== Implementation

The framework provides two implementations of this service, both to allow objects implementing `HasCommandDto` to be converted into serializable ``CommandDto``s, in other words XML.
This is used by the xref:userguide:command-log:about.adoc[Command Log] and xref:userguide:command-replay:about.adoc[Command Replay] extensions to allow commands to be replicated from a primary to secondary system, for regression testing.

The implementations are:

* `o.a.i.applib.services.commanddto.conmap.ContentMappingServiceForCommandDto` will map any single instance of a `HasCommandDto` into a `CommandDto` XML document
* `o.a.i.applib.services.commanddto.conmap.ContentMappingServiceForCommandsDto` will map a list of ``HasCommandDto``s into a `CommandsDto` XML document, and will wrap any single instance of a `CommandWithDto` into a singleton list and thence into a `CommandsDto` XML document.

If the action invocation or property edit represent provides an implementation of a `CommandDtoProcessor` (by way of xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/Action.adoc#commandDtoProcessor[@Action#commandDtoProcessor()] or xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/Property.adoc#commandDtoProcessor[@Property#commandDtoProcessor()]) then this is also called to post-process the persisted `CommandDto` if required.
A typical use case for this is to dynamically add in serialized ``Blob``s or ``Clob``s, the values of which are not captured by default in `CommandDto`.

To support the writing of custom implementations of this interface, the framework also provides `ContentMappingService.Util` which includes a couple of convenience utilities:

[source,java]

public static class Util {
    public static String determineDomainType(
        final List<MediaType> acceptableMediaTypes) { /* ... */ }
    public static boolean isSupported(
            final Class<?> clazz,
            final List<MediaType> acceptableMediaTypes) { /* ... */ }
}
