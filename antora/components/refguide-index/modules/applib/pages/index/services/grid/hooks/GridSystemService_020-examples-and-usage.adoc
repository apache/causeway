== Usage Notes

The framework will check _all_ available implementations of `GridSystemService` to obtain available grid systems, rather than merely the first implementation found, to determine if a grid is available for the domain object to be rendered; in other words it uses the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain-of-responsibility_pattern[chain-of-responsibility] pattern.
Services are called in the order defined by the `@javax.annotation.Priority` annotation.

Note though that each concrete implementation must also provide corresponding Wicket viewer components capable of interpreting the grid layout.
This is therefore a highly specialized and very deep customisation of the framework.
