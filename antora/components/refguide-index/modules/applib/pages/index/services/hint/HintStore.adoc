Defines a mechanism for viewers to store arbitrary UI hints on a per-object basis.

This store _is_ used by the Wicket viewer. For example, the viewer remembers which tabs are selected, and for collections which view is selected (eg table or hidden), which page of a table to render, or whether "show all" (rows) is toggled.

== Members

[#get__Bookmark_String]
=== get(Bookmark, String)

Obtain a hint (eg which tab to open) for a particular object.

Object identity is represented by xref:refguide:applib:index/services/bookmark/Bookmark.adoc[Bookmark] so that alternative implementations can easily serialize this state to a string.

[#set__Bookmark_String_String]
=== set(Bookmark, String, String)

Set the state of a hint for the domain object

[#remove__Bookmark_String]
=== remove(Bookmark, String)

Removes hint for the domain object.

[#removeAll__Bookmark]
=== removeAll(Bookmark)

Remotes all hints for the domain object.

[#findHintKeys__Bookmark]
=== findHintKeys(Bookmark)

The keys of all available hints for the domain object.
