Provides a lookup by logicalTypeName of a domain class' object type, as defined by _DomainObject#logicalTypeName()_ (or any other mechanism that corresponds to Isis' `ObjectTypeFacet` ). Will return an empty result if there is no such non-abstract class registered. (interfaces and abstract types are never added to the lookup table).

== Members

[#lookupLogicalTypeByName__String]
=== lookupLogicalTypeByName(String)

Provides a lookup by logicalTypeName of a domain class' object type, as defined by _DomainObject#logicalTypeName()_ (or any other mechanism that corresponds to Isis' `ObjectTypeFacet` ). Will return an empty result if there is no such non-abstract class registered. (interfaces and abstract types are never added to the lookup table).

[#lookupLogicalTypeByClass__Class]
=== lookupLogicalTypeByClass(Class)

Provides a lookup by class of a domain class' object type, as defined by _DomainObject#logicalTypeName()_ (or any other mechanism that corresponds to Isis' `ObjectTypeFacet` ).

[#rebuild__Class]
=== rebuild(Class)

Invalidates and rebuilds the internal metadata for the specified domain type.

[#getDomainModel__]
=== getDomainModel()

Returns a list of representations of each of member of each domain class.

Used by xref:refguide:applib:index/services/metamodel/MetaModelServiceMenu.adoc[MetaModelServiceMenu] to return a downloadable CSV.

Note that _MetaModelService#exportMetaModel(Config)_ provides a superset of the functionality provided by this method.

[#sortOf__Class_Mode]
=== sortOf(Class, Mode)

What sort of object the domain type represents.

[#sortOf__Bookmark_Mode]
=== sortOf(Bookmark, Mode)

Override of _#sortOf(Class, Mode)_ , extracting the domain type from the provided xref:refguide:applib:index/services/bookmark/Bookmark.adoc[Bookmark] of a domain object instance.

[#commandDtoProcessorFor__String]
=== commandDtoProcessorFor(String)

Obtains the implementation of xref:refguide:applib:index/services/commanddto/processor/CommandDtoProcessor.adoc[CommandDtoProcessor] (if any) as per _Action#commandDtoProcessor()_ or _Property#commandDtoProcessor()_ .

This is used by framework-provided implementations of _org.apache.isis.applib.services.conmap.ContentMappingService_ .

[#exportMetaModel__Config]
=== exportMetaModel(Config)

Exports the entire metamodel as a DTO, serializable into XML using JAXB.

The xref:refguide:applib:index/services/metamodel/Config.adoc[Config] parameter can be used to restrict/filter the export to some subset of the metamodel; in particular to specific _Config#getNamespacePrefixes() namespace prefixes_ .
