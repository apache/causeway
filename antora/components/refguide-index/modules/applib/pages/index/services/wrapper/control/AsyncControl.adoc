Modifies the way in which an asynchronous action initiated through the _org.apache.isis.applib.services.wrapper.WrapperFactory_ is actually executed.

Executing in a separate thread means that the target and arguments are used in a new _org.apache.isis.applib.services.iactn.Interaction_ (and transaction). If any of these are entities, they are retrieved from the database afresh; it isn't possible to pass domain entity references from the foreground calling thread to the background threads.

== Members

[#returningVoid__]
=== returningVoid()

Factory method to instantiate a control instance for a void action or a property edit (where there is no need or intention to provide a return value through the `Future`).

[#returning__Class]
=== returning(Class)

Factory method to instantiate for a control instance for an action returning a value of `` (where this value will be returned through the `Future`).

[#withSkipRules__]
=== withSkipRules()

Skip checking business rules (hide/disable/validate) before executing the underlying property or action

[#with__ExceptionHandler]
=== with(ExceptionHandler)

How to handle exceptions if they occur, using the provided xref:refguide:applib:index/services/wrapper/control/ExceptionHandler.adoc[ExceptionHandler] .

The default behaviour is to rethrow the exception.

[#with__ExecutorService]
=== with(ExecutorService)

Specifies the _ExecutorService_ to use to obtain the thread to invoke the action.

The default executor service is the common pool.

[#withUser__UserMemento]
=== withUser(UserMemento)

Specifies the user for the session used to execute the command asynchronously, in the background.

If not specified, then the user of the current foreground session is used.

[#setFuture__Future]
=== setFuture(Future)

For framework use only.
