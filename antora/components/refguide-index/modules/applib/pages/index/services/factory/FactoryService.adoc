== Members

[#getOrCreate_Class]
=== getOrCreate(Class)

Gets or creates an instance of _requiredType_ , with injection points resolved and any life-cycle callback processed.

Maps onto one of the specialized factory methods _#get(Class)_ or _#create(Class)_ based on the type's meta-data.

[#get_Class]
=== get(Class)

Gets a _Spring_ managed bean of _requiredType_ .

[#detachedEntity_Class]
=== detachedEntity(Class)

Creates a new detached entity instance, with injection points resolved and defaults applied.

The entity will not yet be persisted, in other words: its not yet known to the persistence layer.

[#detachedEntity_T]
=== detachedEntity(T)

Creates a new detached entity instance, with injection points resolved.

The entity will not yet be persisted, in other words: its not yet known to the persistence layer.

[#mixin_Class_Object]
=== mixin(Class, Object)

Creates a new Mixin instance, with injection points resolved.

[#viewModel_Class_Bookmark]
=== viewModel(Class, Bookmark)

Creates a new ViewModel instance, initialized with given _bookmark_ (if any) then resolves any injection points and calls post-construct (if any).

[#viewModel_Class]
=== viewModel(Class)

Creates a new ViewModel instance, with injection points resolved, post-construct called and defaults applied.

[#viewModel_T]
=== viewModel(T)

Resolves injection points for and calls post-construct on given view-model instance.

[#create_Class]
=== create(Class)

Creates a new instance of the specified class, with injection points resolved, post-construct called and defaults applied.
