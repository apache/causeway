== Members

[#NOT_PERSISTABLE]
=== NOT_PERSISTABLE

Object with this state is not an entity (for example it might be a view model, value type or a domain service).

[#SNAPSHOT]
=== SNAPSHOT

Object with this state is an entity that has no session.

[#SNAPSHOT_NO_OID]
=== SNAPSHOT_NO_OID

Object with this state is an entity that has no session and has no OID yet. On pre-store.

[#ATTACHED]
=== ATTACHED

Object with this state is an entity that is attached to a persistence session, in other words changes to the entity will be flushed back to the database.

[#ATTACHED_NO_OID]
=== ATTACHED_NO_OID

Is attached, has no OID yet. On pre-store.

[#DETACHED]
=== DETACHED

Is detached, hence (per definition) has an OID.

Supported by both JDO and JPA. However, historically never used by the framework for JDO.

[#HOLLOW]
=== HOLLOW

JDO specificObject with this state is an entity that no longer attached to a persistence session and cannot be re-attached. In other words: changes to the entity will _not_ be tracked nor flushed back to the database.

JDO distinguishes between DETACHED and HOLLOW, by virtue of _javax.jdo.option.detachAllOnCommit=false_ .

(Unfortunately, we have not found a way to recover _OIDs_ from _hollow_ entities, as used for serialization post commit. We have instead implemented a workaround using the `DnStateManagerForHollow` class).

[#TRANSIENT_OR_REMOVED]
=== TRANSIENT_OR_REMOVED

Object with this state is an entity that is transient or has been removed from the database. Objects in this state may no longer be interacted with.

[#REMOVED]
=== REMOVED

JDO specificNot supported by JPA. (Cannot distinguish between TRANSIENT and REMOVED.)

[#isPersistable_]
=== isPersistable()

Object is an entity, hence is persistable to the database.

[#isAttached_]
=== isAttached()

[#isAttachedNoOid_]
=== isAttachedNoOid()

[#isDetached_]
=== isDetached()

[#isHollow_]
=== isHollow()

[#isTransientOrRemoved_]
=== isTransientOrRemoved()

[#isRemoved_]
=== isRemoved()
