== Implementation

The core framework itself defines only an SPI for this service; there is no default implementation.
Rather, the implementation will depend on the security mechanism being used.

=== SecMan

If you have configured your app to use the xref:security:ROOT:about.adoc[SecMan extension] then note that it _does_ provide an implementation (`UserRegistrationServiceForSecman`) of this `UserRegistrationService`.
This can be configured to set up initial roles; see xref:security:secman:setting-up.adoc#user-registration-aka-sign-up[secman docs] for details.
