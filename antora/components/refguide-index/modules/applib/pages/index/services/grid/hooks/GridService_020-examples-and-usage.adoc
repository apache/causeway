== Caching

Once a grid has been loaded for a domain class, this is cached internally by Apache Isis' internal meta model (in the `GridFacet` facet).

If running in prototype mode, any subsequent changes to the XML will be detected and the grid rebuilt.
This allows for dynamic reloading of layouts, providing a far faster feedback (eg if tweaking the UI while working with end-users).
Dynamic reloading is disabled in production mode.

This service is called by xref:refguide:applib:index/services/layout/LayoutService.adoc[LayoutService], exposed in the UI through `LayoutServiceMenu` (to download the layout XML as a zip file for all domain objects) and the xref:applib-classes:mixins.adoc#java-lang-object[downloadLayoutXml()] mixin (to download the layout XML for a single domain
object).

This service delegates to:

* to xref:refguide:applib:index/services/grid/GridLoaderService.adoc[GridLoaderService] to load a pre-existing layout for the domain class, if possible

* to xref:refguide:applib:index/services/grid/GridSystemService.adoc[GridSystemService] to normalize the grid with respect to Apache Isis' internal metamodel, in other words to ensure that all of the domain objects' properties, collections and actions are associated with regions of the grid.
