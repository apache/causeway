Domain service to (attempt) to recognize certain exceptions, and return user-friendly messages instead.

Rather than redirecting to a general-purpose error page, the message (corresponding to the recognized exception) is rendered as a regular validation message.

For example, a set of recognizers are provided for the JPA object store in order to recognize and handle SQL constraint exceptions such as uniqueness violations. These can then be rendered back to the user as expected errors, rather than fatal stacktraces.

More than one implementation of xref:refguide:applib:index/services/exceprecog/ExceptionRecognizer.adoc[ExceptionRecognizer] can be registered; they will all be consulted (in the order as specified by Spring's _org.springframework.core.annotation.Order_ annotation) to determine if they recognize the exception. The message returned by the first service recognizing the exception is used.

The framework also provides a default implementation of this service that recognizes any _org.apache.causeway.applib.exceptions.RecoverableException_ , simply returning the exception's _org.apache.causeway.applib.exceptions.RecoverableException#getMessage() message_ . This allows any component or domain object to throw this exception with the knowledge that it will be handled appropriately.

Initially introduced for the Wicket viewer; check the documentation of other viewers to determine whether they also support this service.
