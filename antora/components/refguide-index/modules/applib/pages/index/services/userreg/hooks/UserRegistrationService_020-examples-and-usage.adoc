== Usage by the framework

The xref:vw:ROOT:about.adoc[Wicket viewer] supports user registration, relying on
both the xref:refguide:applib:index/services/userreg/EmailNotificationService.adoc[EmailNotificationService] and xref:refguide:applib:index/services/email/EmailService.adoc[EmailService].

The framework provides default implementations of both of these services.
The notification service requires no further configuration.
The email service (`EmailServiceDefault`) _does_ require a couple of configuration properties to be set (specifying the SMTP mail server/accounts/password).

=== User sign-up

For user sign-up, the xref:vw:ROOT:about.adoc[Wicket viewer] will check whether an implementation of this service (and also the xref:refguide:applib:index/services/userreg/EmailNotificationService.adoc[EmailNotificationService]) is available, and if so will render a sign-up page where the user enters their email address.
A verification email is sent (using the aforementioned `EmailNotificationService`) which includes a link back to the running application; this allows the user then to complete their registration process (choose user name, password and so on).
When the user has provided the additional details, the Wicket viewer calls _this_ service in order to create an account for them, and then logs the user on.


=== Password reset

For the password reset feature, the Wicket viewer will render a password reset page, and use the `EmailNotificationService` to send a "password forgotten" email.
This service provides the ability to reset a password based on the user's email address.


Further details on the user registration feature (as supported by the Wicket viewer) are discussed  xref:vw:ROOT:features.adoc#user-registration[here].

=== Other usages

It is of course possible for domain objects to use this service; it will be injected into domain object or other domain services in the usual way.
That said, we expect that such use cases will be comparatively rare; the primary use case is for the Wicket viewer's sign-up page.
