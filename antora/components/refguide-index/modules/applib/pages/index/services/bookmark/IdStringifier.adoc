SPI to convert the identifier (primary key) of an entity, of a given type (eg Integer) into a string, and to convert back again into the key object used to actually look up the target entity instance.

This is ultimately used by xref:refguide:applib:index/services/bookmark/BookmarkService.adoc[BookmarkService] where we hold a persistent reference to an entity. The resultant string also appears in URLs of the Wicket viewer and Restful Objects viewers, and in mementos eg in _org.apache.causeway.schema.cmd.v2.CommandDto_ and _org.apache.causeway.schema.ixn.v2.InteractionDto_ .

The framework provides default implementations of this SPI for the supported value types. Modules that define application-defined primary keys can provide their own implementations of this SPI, for examples see the JPA entities defined in the commandlog-jpa module.
