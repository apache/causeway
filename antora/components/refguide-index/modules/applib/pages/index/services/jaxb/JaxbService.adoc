Allows instances of JAXB-annotated classes to be marshalled to XML and unmarshalled from XML back into domain objects.

The default implementation automatically caches the JAXB marshallers by target class.

== Members

[#fromXml_Class_String]
=== fromXml(Class, String)

Unmarshalls the XML to the specified domain class.

[#fromXml_Class_String_Map]
=== fromXml(Class, String, Map)

Unmarshalls the XML to the specified domain class, with additional properties passed through to the _JAXBContext_ used to performed the unmarshalling.

[#toXml_Object]
=== toXml(Object)

Marshalls the object into XML (using a _JAXBContext_ for the object's class).

[#toXml_Object_Map]
=== toXml(Object, Map)

Marshalls the object into XML specifying additional properties (passed to the _JAXBContext_ used for the object's class).

[#toXsd_Object_CausewaySchemas]
=== toXsd(Object, CausewaySchemas)

Generates a map of each of the schemas referenced; the key is the schema namespace, the value is the XML of the schema itself.

A JAXB-annotated domain object will live in its own XSD namespace and may reference multiple other XSD schemas. In particular, many JAXB domain objects will reference the common causeway schemas. The xref:refguide:applib:index/services/jaxb/CausewaySchemas.adoc[CausewaySchemas] paramter indicates whether these schemas should be included or excluded from the map.

[#simple_]
=== simple()

'Simple' because no injection point resolving or advanced xref:refguide:applib:index/domain/DomainObjectList.adoc[DomainObjectList] handling.
