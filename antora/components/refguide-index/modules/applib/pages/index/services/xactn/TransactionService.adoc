Provides utilities to access active transactions associated with the current thread.

This is a low-level service that domain objects will typically have little need to leverage; there will normally be a transaction started already by the framework at the beginning of an _org.apache.isis.applib.services.iactn.Interaction_ and committed at the end. On occasion though it can be useful to take explicit control over transaction boundaries, which is where the methods provided by this domain service can be useful.

[#currentTransactionId__]
=== currentTransactionId()

Optionally returns the unique identifier of the current thread's transaction, based on whether there is an active transaction associated with the current thread.

[#currentTransactionState__]
=== currentTransactionState()

Returns the state of the current thread's transaction., or returns _TransactionState#NONE_ , if there is no active transaction associated with the current thread.

[#flushTransaction__]
=== flushTransaction()

Flushes all changes to the object store.

Occasionally useful to ensure that newly persisted domain objects are flushed to the database prior to a subsequent repository query.

If there is no active transaction associated with the current thread, then does nothing.
