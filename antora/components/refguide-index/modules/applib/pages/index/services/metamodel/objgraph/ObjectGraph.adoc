[#transform_ObjectGraph_Transformer]
=== transform(ObjectGraph_Transformer)

Passes a (deep clone) copy of this xref:refguide:applib:index/services/metamodel/objgraph/ObjectGraph.adoc[ObjectGraph] to given _Transformer_ and returns a transformed xref:refguide:applib:index/services/metamodel/objgraph/ObjectGraph.adoc[ObjectGraph] .

Hence transformers are not required to create defensive copies.

[#copy_]
=== copy()

Returns a (deep clone) copy of this xref:refguide:applib:index/services/metamodel/objgraph/ObjectGraph.adoc[ObjectGraph] .

[#kernel_ImmutableEnumSet]
=== kernel(ImmutableEnumSet)

Returns a _GraphKernel_ of given characteristics.

[#objectsGroupedByPackage_]
=== objectsGroupedByPackage()

Returns objects grouped by package (as list-multimap).

[#objectById_]
=== objectById()

Returns a _Map_ from object.id to _Object ObjectGraph.Object_

[#subGraph_int]
=== subGraph(int)

Returns a sub-graph comprised only of object nodes as picked per zero based indexes _int[]_ .
