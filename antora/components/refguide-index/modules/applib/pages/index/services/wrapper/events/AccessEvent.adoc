 _Supported only by _org.apache.isis.applib.services.wrapper.WrapperFactory_ service,_ represents an access (reading) of a property, collection or title.

Analogous to xref:refguide:applib:index/services/wrapper/events/ValidityEvent.adoc[ValidityEvent] (which corresponds to modifying a property or collection etc), however the _#getReason()_ will always be `null` . (If access is not allowed then a vetoing xref:refguide:applib:index/services/wrapper/events/VisibilityEvent.adoc[VisibilityEvent] would have been fired).
