[#executeCommand__InteractionContextPolicy_Command]
=== executeCommand(InteractionContextPolicy, Command)

Executes the specified xref:refguide:applib:index/services/command/Command.adoc[Command] using the required _InteractionContextPolicy_ , updating the Command (or its persistent equivalent) afterwards (for example, setting its _Command#getCommandDto() commandDto_ field.

[#executeCommand__InteractionContextPolicy_CommandDto_CommandOutcomeHandler]
=== executeCommand(InteractionContextPolicy, CommandDto, CommandOutcomeHandler)

Executes the specified command (represented as a _CommandDto_ using the required _InteractionContextPolicy_ .

IMPORTANT: THIS METHOD HAS SIGNIFICANT SIDE-EFFECTS. Specifically, the xref:refguide:applib:index/services/command/Command.adoc[Command] of the executing thread (obtained using _org.apache.isis.applib.services.iactn.InteractionProvider_ to obtain the xref:refguide:applib:index/services/iactn/Interaction.adoc[Interaction] , and then _Interaction#getCommand()_ to obtain the xref:refguide:applib:index/services/command/Command.adoc[Command] ) will be UPDATED to hold the _CommandDto_ passed in.

Optionally an xref:refguide:applib:index/services/command/CommandOutcomeHandler.adoc[CommandOutcomeHandler] can be provided to process the result. This is used by the persistent implementations to update their respective persistent equivalents of xref:refguide:applib:index/services/command/Command.adoc[Command] .

[#executeCommand__Command]
=== executeCommand(Command)

As per _#executeCommand(InteractionContextPolicy, Command)_ , with a policy of _InteractionContextPolicy#NO_SWITCH no switch_ .

Note that this method updates the Command as a side-effect.

[#executeCommand__CommandDto_CommandOutcomeHandler]
=== executeCommand(CommandDto, CommandOutcomeHandler)

As per _#executeCommand(InteractionContextPolicy, CommandDto, CommandOutcomeHandler)_ , with a policy of _InteractionContextPolicy#NO_SWITCH no switch_ .

Note that this method has significant side-effects.
