== Implementation

The framework provides a number of default implementations for xref:pjpa:ROOT:about.adoc[JPA/Eclipselink], to recognise:

* data already exists (uniqueness constraints)
* object not found
* related data exists (foreign key constraints preventing change)
* unable to save data (foreign key constraints not met)
* other data access problem based on a particular type that they throw, xref:refguide:applib:index/services/exceprecog/ExceptionRecognizerForType.adoc[] and its subclass in turn, xref:refguide:core:index/metamodel/services/exceprecog/ExceptionRecognizerForRecoverableException.adoc[]



=== Configuration Properties

The following configuration property is relevant:

[cols="2a,1,3a", options="header"]
|===
|Property
|Value +
(default value)
|Description

| `causeway.core.runtime-services.` +
`exception-recognizer.dae.disable`
|`true`,`false` +
(`false`)
|whether any `DataAccessException` exceptions should be recognized.+

If Spring encounters a data access problem then it will throw a subclass of `DataAccessException`.

This recogniser catches this exception class and throws a suitable recognition based on the subtype.

By default, this is enabled.
Disable it only if you need to fine-tune the built-in behaviour.
