== Usage Notes

``Execution``s can be subscribed to using the xref:refguide:applib:index/services/publishing/spi/ExecutionSubscriber.adoc[ExecutionSubscriber] interface.
+
One reason to subscribe is to persist these interaction/executions.
This supports several use cases:

** they enable profiling of the running application (which actions are invoked then most often, what is their response time)

** if auditing is configured (using xref:refguide:applib:index/services/publishing/spi/EntityPropertyChangeSubscriber.adoc[EntityPropertyChangeSubscriber]), they provide better audit information, since the parent xref:refguide:applib:index/services/iactn/Interaction.adoc[Interaction] captures the 'cause' of an interaction and can be correlated to the audit records (the "effect" of the interaction) by way of the xref:applib-classes:mixins.adoc[uniqueId] that both share.
