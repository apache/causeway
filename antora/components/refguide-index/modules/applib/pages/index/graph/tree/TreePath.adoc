* /0 ... the tree root
* /0/1 ... the second child of root
* /0/0/0 ... the first child of first child of root

Returns a TreePath instance that represents the parent path of this TreePath, if this is not the root.

== Members

[#size_]
=== size()

Number of path-elements.

[#append_int]
=== append(int)

[#subPath_int]
=== subPath(int)

Returns a sub-path containing all the path-elements of this path, skipping startIndex number of path elements at the start.

[#getParentIfAny_]
=== getParentIfAny()

Returns a TreePath instance that represents the parent path of this TreePath, if this is not the root.

[#childIndex_]
=== childIndex()

Optionally the 2nd path-element's value, based on presence. It corresponds to the sibling index of the child node this tree-path (either directly references or) includes.

[#parse_String_String]
=== parse(String, String)
