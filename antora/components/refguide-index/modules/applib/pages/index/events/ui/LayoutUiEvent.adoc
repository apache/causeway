* capture the layout, if any, as specified to one of the subscribers

[#LayoutUiEvent__]
=== LayoutUiEvent()

If used then the framework will set state via (non-API) setters.

Because the _EventObject_ superclass prohibits a null source, a dummy value is temporarily used.

[#setLayout__String]
=== setLayout(String)

For subscribers to call to provide a layout for this object.
