Emitted for subscribers to provide a cssClass hint (equivalent to the `icon(..)` supporting method).

If the domain object defines its own xref:refguide:applib-methods:ui-hints.adoc[iconName()] supporting method, or if it has the xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/DomainObjectLayout.adoc#cssClassFa[@DomainObjectLayout#cssClassFa()] attribute, then these will take precedence.

The class has a number of responsibilities:

* capture the target object being interacted with
* capture the icon (name), if any, as specified to one of the subscribers

The class itself is instantiated automatically by the framework.
