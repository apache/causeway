Helper class to create properly concatenated reason string for use in method that return _String_ s with reasons.

If no reasons are specified _#getReason()_ will return `null` , otherwise it will return a _String_ with all the valid reasons concatenated with a semi-colon separating each one.

An alternative is to use the (very simple) xref:refguide:applib:index/util/Reasons.adoc[Reasons] class or the (much more sophisticated) xref:refguide:applib:index/util/ReasonBuffer2.adoc[ReasonBuffer2] .
