Allows JAXB-annotated view models to act as a mixee in order that other modules (and the core framework) can contribute behaviour.

A JAXB view model is one annotated with _jakarta.xml.bind.annotation.XmlRootElement_ .

The two mixin behaviours contributed by the core framework are the ability to download the view model as XML (using xref:refguide:applib:index/mixins/dto/Dto_downloadXml.adoc[Dto_downloadXml] ) and to download the XSD schema for that XML (using xref:refguide:applib:index/mixins/dto/Dto_downloadXsd.adoc[Dto_downloadXsd] ).

The interface is just a marker interface (with no members).
