== Alternative approaches

An alternative to using the framework's `TimestampService` is to leverage xref:pjpa:ROOT:about.adoc[JPA/Eclipselink]â€™s built-in versioning support via the `@jakarta.persistence.Version` annotation.

For example:

[source,java]
----
import jakarta.persistence.Column;
import jakarta.persistence.Entity;
import jakarta.persistence.Version;

@Entity
public class Customer {

    @Version
    @Column(name = "version")
    private java.sql.Timestamp version;

    public java.sql.Timestamp getVersionSequence() {
        return version;
    }
}
----
