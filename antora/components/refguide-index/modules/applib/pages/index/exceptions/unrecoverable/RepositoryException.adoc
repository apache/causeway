Indicates that a repository method has failed.

This exception is intended to represent an unexpected and non-recoverable condition (eg a syntax error in some named query syntax, or similar), and so is a subclass of xref:refguide:applib:index/exceptions/UnrecoverableException.adoc[UnrecoverableException] . Throwing this exception will therefore result in (some sort of) error page being displayed to the user.
