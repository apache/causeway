A generalization of Java's class type to also hold a logical name, which can be supplied lazily.

Equality is driven by the corresponding class exclusively, meaning the logical name is ignored in order to not cause any side-effects on logical name memoization eg. it happening too early.

Meta-model validators will take care, that there is no logical name ambiguity: There cannot be any LogicalTypes sharing the same corresponding class while having different logical names.

Returns a new TypeIdentifier based on the corresponding class and (ahead of time) known _logicalName_ .
--
<.> xref:#fqcn_Class[fqcn(Class)]
+
--
Use the corresponding class's fully qualified name for the _logicalName_ . Most likely used in testing scenarios.

Canonical name of the corresponding class.

The logical type name consists of 2 parts, the _namespace_ and the _logical simple name_ .

<.> xref:#namespace_[namespace()]

The logical type name consists of 2 parts, the _namespace_ and the _logical simple name_ .

<.> xref:#logicalNameFormatted_String_String[logicalNameFormatted(String, String)]

--
The logical type name consists of 2 parts, the _namespace_ and the _logical simple name_ . Returns a concatenation of _namespace_ , _delimiter_ and the _logical simple name_ , whereas in the absence of a _namespace_ returns a concatenation of _root_ and the _logical simple name_ .
