Adapter to make it easy to write xref:refguide:applib:index/spec/Specification.adoc[Specification] s.

Provides two main features:

* first, is type-safe (with invalid type being either ignored or constituting a failure), and
* second, checks for nulls (with a null either being ignore or again constituting a failure)

Implementation note: inspired by (borrowed code from) Hamcrest's `TypeSafeMatcher` .
