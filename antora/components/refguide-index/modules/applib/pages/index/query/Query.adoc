For use by repository implementations, representing the values of a query.

The implementations of these objects are be provided by the underlying persistor/object store; consult its documentation.

Implementations are expected to implement the _#getRange()_ method, which is used to support range / paging the data. Returned result sets are expected to start from index "start", and no more than "count" items are expected.

 *Note:* not every object store will necessarily support this interface. In particular, the in-memory object store does not. For this, you can use the _Predicate_ interface to similar effect, for example in _RepositoryService#allMatches(Class, Predicate, long, long)_ ). *Note:* that the predicate is applied within the xref:refguide:applib:index/services/repository/RepositoryService.adoc[RepositoryService] (ie client-side) rather than being pushed back to the object store.
