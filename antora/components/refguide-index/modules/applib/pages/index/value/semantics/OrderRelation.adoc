Provides an ordering relation for a given value-type.

Does supports an _epsilon_ parameter (measure of accuracy), which has different meaning, depending on context

* Numbers: accuracy is usually given as number eg. _1E-12_ - in case of integers should default to _0_
* Dates (temporal): accuracy is usually given as a number of days - should default to _0_
* Times (temporal): accuracy is usually given as a number of seconds - eg. _1E-3_ for millisecond resolution
