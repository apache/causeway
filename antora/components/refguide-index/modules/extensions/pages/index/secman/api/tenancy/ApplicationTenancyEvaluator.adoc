Optional SPI interface to be implemented by a domain service, providing an alternative mechanism for evaluating the application tenancy of the object being interacted with (the "what") and optionally also the tenancy of the user making the call (the "who").

== Members

[#handles__Class]
=== handles(Class)

Whether this evaluator can determine the tenancy of the specified domain entity (such as `ToDoItem` ) being interacted with (the "what").

This method is also called to determine if the evaluator is also able to determine the tenancy of the security module's own xref:refguide:extensions:index/secman/api/user/ApplicationUser.adoc[ApplicationUser] , ie the "who" is doing the interacting. If the evaluator does not handle the class, then the fallback behaviour is to invoke _ApplicationUser#getAtPath()_ } on the xref:refguide:extensions:index/secman/api/user/ApplicationUser.adoc[ApplicationUser] and use the path from that.

[#hides__Object_ApplicationUser]
=== hides(Object, ApplicationUser)

Whether this domain object should not be visible to the specified xref:refguide:extensions:index/secman/api/user/ApplicationUser.adoc[ApplicationUser] .

The domain object will be one that is handled by this evaluator, in other words that _#handles(Class)_ was previously called and the evaluator returned `true` .

A non-null return value means that the object should be hidden.

[#disables__Object_ApplicationUser]
=== disables(Object, ApplicationUser)

Whether the object members of this domain object should be disabled/read-only for the specified xref:refguide:extensions:index/secman/api/user/ApplicationUser.adoc[ApplicationUser] .

The domain object will be one that is handled by this evaluator, in other words that _#handles(Class)_ was previously called and the evaluator returned `true` .

This method is only called after _#hides(Object, ApplicationUser)_ and only if that method returned `false` .

A non-null return value means that the object should be disabled, and is used as the reason why the object member is disabled.
