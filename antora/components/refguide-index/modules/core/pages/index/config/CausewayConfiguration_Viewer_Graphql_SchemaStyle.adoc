== Members

[#SIMPLE_ONLY]
=== SIMPLE_ONLY

Expose only the 'simple' schema, defining only fields that return the state of the domain objects but with no fields to represent additional facets of state (such as whether an action is hidden or disabled).

Suitable for clients where the application logic and state is the responsibility of the client.

[#RICH_ONLY]
=== RICH_ONLY

Expose only the 'rich' schema, exposing not only fields that return the state of the domain objects but _also_ with fields to represent additional facets of state (such as whether an action is hidden or disabled).

Optionally, fields for Scenario (given/when/then) testing may also be added if the _Schema.Rich#enableScenarioTesting()_ config property is set.

Suitable for clients where the application logic and state remains in the backend, within the domain model hosted by Causeway.

[#SIMPLE_AND_RICH]
=== SIMPLE_AND_RICH

Exposes both the simple and rich schemas, for the query have each under a field as defined by _Schema.Simple#topLevelFieldName()_ (by default 'simple') and _Schema.Rich#topLevelFieldName()_ (by default 'rich').

For mutations, use the _simple_ schema types.

[#RICH_AND_SIMPLE]
=== RICH_AND_SIMPLE

Exposes both the simple and rich schemas, for the query have each under a field as defined by _Schema.Simple#topLevelFieldName()_ (by default 'simple') and _Schema.Rich#topLevelFieldName()_ (by default 'rich').

For mutations, use the _rich_ schema types.
