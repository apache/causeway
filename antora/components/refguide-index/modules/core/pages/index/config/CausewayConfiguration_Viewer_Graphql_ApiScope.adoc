The generated GraphQL spec is restricted only to include only _org.apache.causeway.applib.annotation.Nature#VIEW_MODEL view model_ s.

Applicable when the GraphQL API is in use by third-party clients, ie public use and not under the control of the authors of the backend Apache Causeway application. Exposing entities also would couple the GraphQL client too deeply to the backend implementation.

[#ALL]
=== ALL

The generated GraphQL spec is not restricted, includes both _org.apache.causeway.applib.annotation.Nature#ENTITY domain entities_ as well as _org.apache.causeway.applib.annotation.Nature#VIEW_MODEL view model_ s.

This is perfectly acceptable where the team developing the GraphQL client is the same as the team developing the backend service ... the use of the Web API between the client and server is a implementation detail of the application.
