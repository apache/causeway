WARNING: TODO: v2: to be updated


This Maven module contains implementations of both public API services (as defined in the applib) and also non-API classes.

See the xref:refguide:applib-svc:[Domain Services Reference Guide] for details on the public API services.

This documentation relates only to the non-API services
These documents should be
thought of as part of the internal design of the framework, and are liable to change from release to release.


[WARNING]
====
We do not guarantee that link:http://semver.org[semantic versioning] will be honoured for these services.
