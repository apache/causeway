[#enlistCreated_ManagedObject]
=== enlistCreated(ManagedObject)

Publishing support: for object stores to enlist an object that has just been created, capturing a dummy value `'[NEW]'` for the pre-modification value.

The post-modification values are captured when the transaction commits.

[#enlistUpdating_ManagedObject_Function]
=== enlistUpdating(ManagedObject, Function)

Publishing support: for object stores to enlist an object that is about to be updated, capturing the pre-modification values of the properties of the xref:refguide:core:index/metamodel/object/ManagedObject.adoc[ManagedObject] .

The post-modification values are captured when the transaction commits.

Overload is an optimization for the JPA object store where we already have access to the changed records by accessing the ORM-specific data structures ( _jakarta.persistence.EntityManager_ 's "unit-of-work").

[#enlistDeleting_ManagedObject]
=== enlistDeleting(ManagedObject)

Publishing support: for object stores to enlist an object that is about to be deleted, capturing the pre-deletion value of the properties of the xref:refguide:core:index/metamodel/object/ManagedObject.adoc[ManagedObject] .

The post-modification values are captured when the transaction commits. In the case of deleted objects, a dummy value `'[DELETED]'` is used as the post-modification value.

[#incrementLoaded_ManagedObject]
=== incrementLoaded(ManagedObject)

Not strictly part of the concern of entity tracking, but allows the default implementation to also implement the _org.apache.causeway.applib.services.metrics.MetricsService_ .
