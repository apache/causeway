[#onPostCreate_ManagedObject]
=== onPostCreate(ManagedObject)

Independent of the persistence stack, called when an object has been created in-memory, for example by xref:refguide:applib:index/services/factory/FactoryService.adoc[FactoryService] and internal _ObjectManager_ .

Default implementation fires off callback/lifecycle events.

[#onPostLoad_ManagedObject]
=== onPostLoad(ManagedObject)

Called by the JPA object store, just after an object is retrieved from the database.

Default implementation calls `EntityChangeTracker#recognizeLoaded(ManagedObject)` and fires off callback/lifecycle events.

[#onPrePersist_Either]
=== onPrePersist(Either)

Called by the JPA object store, just before an entity is inserted into the database.

Default implementation fires callbacks (including emitting the `PreStoreEvent` , eg as subscribed) by the `TimestampService` .

[#onPostPersist_ManagedObject]
=== onPostPersist(ManagedObject)

Called by the JPA object store, just after an entity has been inserted into the database.

Default implementation fires callbacks and enlists the entity within `EntityChangeTracker` for create/persist.

[#onPreUpdate_ManagedObject_Function]
=== onPreUpdate(ManagedObject, Function)

Called by the JPA object store, just before the object is about to be updated.

Default implementation fires callbacks and enlists the entity within `EntityChangeTracker` for update.

[#onPostUpdate_ManagedObject]
=== onPostUpdate(ManagedObject)

Called by the JPA object store, after an existing entity has been updated.

Default implementation fires callbacks.

[#onPreRemove_ManagedObject]
=== onPreRemove(ManagedObject)

Called by the JPA object store, just before an entity is deleted from the database.

Default implementation fires callbacks and enlists the entity within `EntityChangeTracker` for delete/remove.
