EntityListener class for listing with the _jakarta.persistence.EntityListeners_ annotation, to support injection point resolving for entities, and to notify xref:refguide:core:index/metamodel/services/objectlifecycle/ObjectLifecyclePublisher.adoc[ObjectLifecyclePublisher] of changes.

Instances of this class are not managed by Spring, but by the persistence layer.

The particular persistence layer implementation in use needs to be configured, with a BeanManager, that is able to resolve injection points for this EntityListener.
