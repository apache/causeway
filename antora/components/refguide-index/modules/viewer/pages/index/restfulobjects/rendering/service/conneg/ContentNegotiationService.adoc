Generates a representation according to HTTP `Accept` header of the request.

This idea is discussed in section 34.1 of theRestful Objects specv1.0.

The principal motivation is to allow more flexible representations to be generated for REST clients that (perhaps through their use of a certain JavaScript library, say) expect, or at least works best with, a certain style of representation.
