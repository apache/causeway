== Usage Notes

The value of the `x-ro-domain-type` parameter corresponds to the DTO to be mapped into by the xref:refguide:applib:index/services/conmap/ContentMappingService.adoc[ContentMappingService].

If the DTO is annotated with JAXB, then also note that the runtime type must be annotated with the JAXB `jakarta.xml.bind.annotation.XmlRootElement` so that it can unambiguously serialized.


== Example

For example, consider a todo app that defines a  `ToDoItemDto` class, generated from an XSD and therefore JAXB annotated.

An implementation of `ContentMappingService` that maps the application's `todoapp.dom.module.todoitem.ToDoItem` entities into `todoapp.dto.module.todoitem.ToDoItemDto` classes.

A REST client can therefore request a DTO representation of an entity by invoking

[source]
----
http://localhost:8080/restful/objects/TODO/0
----

with an `Accept` header of:

[source]
----
application/xml;profile=urn:org.restfulobjects:repr-types/object;x-ro-domain-type=todoapp.dto.module.todoitem.ToDoItemDto
----

will result in an XML serialization of that class:

while similarly hitting the same URL with an `Accept` header of:

[source]
----
application/json;profile=urn:org.restfulobjects:repr-types/object;x-ro-domain-type=todoapp.dto.module.todoitem.ToDoItemDto
----

will result in the JSON serialization of that class:
