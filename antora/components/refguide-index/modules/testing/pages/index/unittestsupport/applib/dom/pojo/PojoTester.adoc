Exercises the getters and setters of the provided pojo, ensuring that there are no side-effects.

As getters and setters are so simple, the intention of automating their testing is not to discover defects (though if there are unintentional side-effects, then these will be found). Instead, the rationale of testing getters and setters is to increase code coverage. Any substantial gap away from 100% would therefore due to significant functionality not having tests (as opposed to merely getters and setters not being tested).

== Members

[#create_]
=== create()

Factory method for the tester itself.

This method is usually followed by several calls to _#usingData(DatumFactory)_ or _#usingData(Class, Object[])_ (for all data types that are not built-in), and finally by _#exercise(Object)_ (or one of its overloads) which actually exercises the provided pojo.

[#usingData_DatumFactory]
=== usingData(DatumFactory)

Provides a _DatumFactory_ to the xref:refguide:testing:index/unittestsupport/applib/dom/pojo/PojoTester.adoc[PojoTester] in order to exercise any getter/setters of this type.

The xref:refguide:testing:index/unittestsupport/applib/dom/pojo/PojoTester.adoc[PojoTester] already knows how to exercise primitives, strings, enums and a number of other built-ins, so this is typically only necessary for custom value types.

[#usingData_Class_T]
=== usingData(Class, T)

Convenience overload to provide a _DatumFactory_ to the xref:refguide:testing:index/unittestsupport/applib/dom/pojo/PojoTester.adoc[PojoTester] , specifying both the type and a number of instances of that type.

There should be at least two and ideally three different data instances.

[#usingData_Class_Class]
=== usingData(Class, Class)

Convenience overload to provide a _DatumFactory_ to the xref:refguide:testing:index/unittestsupport/applib/dom/pojo/PojoTester.adoc[PojoTester] for the specified compile time type, with the runtime type providing a no-arg constructor so that instances can be generated as required.

[#usingData_Class]
=== usingData(Class)

Convenience overload to provide a _DatumFactory_ to the xref:refguide:testing:index/unittestsupport/applib/dom/pojo/PojoTester.adoc[PojoTester] for the specified compile time type, also instantiable as the runtime type (with a no-arg constructor).

[#exercise_Object]
=== exercise(Object)

Exercises all of the getters and setters of the provided bean, using the built-in _DatumFactory_ and any additional configured through previous calls to _#usingData(Class, Object[])_ (or its overloads).

[#exercise_Object_FilterSet]
=== exercise(Object, FilterSet)

As for _#exercise(Object)_ , however only exercising the properties as defined by the provided _FilterSet_ , and omitting any others.
