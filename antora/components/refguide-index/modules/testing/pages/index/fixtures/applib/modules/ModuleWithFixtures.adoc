A module is a class that implements this xref:refguide:testing:index/fixtures/applib/modules/ModuleWithFixtures.adoc[ModuleWithFixtures] interface, but in addition is expected to be annotated with _Configuration @Configuration_ and which defines a dependency other modules by _Import @Import_ ing them, and conversely may be a dependency of other modules if they import it.

Modules are therefore classes that define a module hierarchy using these Spring annotations.

These are, in effect, a module hierarchy, declared using types.

Optionally, the `@Configuration` class can implements this xref:refguide:testing:index/fixtures/applib/modules/ModuleWithFixtures.adoc[ModuleWithFixtures] interface. Doing so allows it to declare setup and teardown fixtures, eg to set up permanent ref data or to teardown test entities within the module.

These setup/teardown fixtures will be called in the correct order as per the transitive dependency graph inferred from the `@Configuration` imports.

[#getRefDataSetupFixture__]
=== getRefDataSetupFixture()

Optionally each module can define a xref:refguide:testing:index/fixtures/applib/fixturescripts/FixtureScript.adoc[FixtureScript] which holds immutable "reference data".

By default, returns a _FixtureScript#NOOP noop_ .

[#getTeardownFixture__]
=== getTeardownFixture()

Optionally each module can define a tear-down xref:refguide:testing:index/fixtures/applib/fixturescripts/FixtureScript.adoc[FixtureScript] , used to remove the contents of _all_ transactional entities (both reference data and operational/transactional data).

By default, returns a _FixtureScript#NOOP noop_ .
