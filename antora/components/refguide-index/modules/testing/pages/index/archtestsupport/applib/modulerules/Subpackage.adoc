== Members

[#getName__]
=== getName()

The name of the subpackage, for example "dom", "api", "spi" or "fixtures".

[#mayBeAccessedBySubpackagesInSameModule__]
=== mayBeAccessedBySubpackagesInSameModule()

A list of the (names of the) subpackages where classes in the same module as this package have access.

For example, the "dom" subpackage can probably be referenced from the "menu" subpackage, but not vice versa.

The special value of "*" is a wildcard meaning that all subpackages (in the same module) can access.

[#mayBeAccessedBySubpackagesInReferencingModules__]
=== mayBeAccessedBySubpackagesInReferencingModules()

A list of the (names of the) subpackages where classes in the packages of other referencing modules may have access.

For example, in some cases the the "dom" subpackage may _not_ be accessible from other modules if the intention is to require all programmatic access through an "api" subpackage (where the classes in `dom` implement interfaces defined in `api` ).

The special value of "*" is a wildcard meaning that all subpackages (in other modules) can access.
