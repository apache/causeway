[#every_jpa_Entity_must_be_annotated_with_DomainObject_nature_of_ENTITY__]
=== every_jpa_Entity_must_be_annotated_with_DomainObject_nature_of_ENTITY()

This rule requires that classes annotated with the JPA _Entity_ annotation must also be annotated with the Apache Isis xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/DomainObject.adoc[DomainObject] annotation specifying that its _DomainObject#nature() nature_ is an _org.apache.isis.applib.annotation.Nature#ENTITY entity_ .

[#every_jpa_Entity_must_be_annotated_with_XmlJavaAdapter_of_PersistentEntityAdapter__]
=== every_jpa_Entity_must_be_annotated_with_XmlJavaAdapter_of_PersistentEntityAdapter()

This rule requires that classes annotated with the JPA _Entity_ annotation must also be annotated with the Apache Isis _javax.xml.bind.annotation.adapters.XmlJavaTypeAdapter_ annotation with a value of _org.apache.isis.applib.jaxb.PersistentEntityAdapter_ `.class` .

Tnis is so that entities can be transparently referenced from XML-style view models.

[#every_jpa_Entity_must_be_annotated_as_an_IsisEntityListener__]
=== every_jpa_Entity_must_be_annotated_as_an_IsisEntityListener()

This rule requires that classes annotated with the JPA _Entity_ annotation must also be annotated with the _javax.persistence.EntityListeners_ annotation that includes a value of `org.apache.isis.persistence.jpa.applib.integration.IsisEntityListener.class` .

Tnis is so that entities can be transparently referenced from XML-style view models.

[#every_jpa_Entity_must_implement_Comparable__]
=== every_jpa_Entity_must_implement_Comparable()

This rule requires that classes annotated with the JPA _Entity_ annotation must also be implement _Comparable_ .

This is so that entities have a natural ordering and can safely be added to parented collections of type _java.util.SortedSet_ .

[#every_jpa_Entity_must_be_annotated_as_Table_with_uniqueConstraints__]
=== every_jpa_Entity_must_be_annotated_as_Table_with_uniqueConstraints()

This rule requires that classes annotated with the JPA _Entity_ annotation must also be annotated with the JPA _Table_ annotation which includes _Table#uniqueConstraints() uniqueConstraints_ .

This is so that entities will have an alternative business key in addition to the system-defined surrogate key.

[#every_jpa_Entity_must_be_annotated_as_Table_with_schema__]
=== every_jpa_Entity_must_be_annotated_as_Table_with_schema()

This rule requires that classes annotated with the JPA _Entity_ annotation must also be annotated with the JPA _Table_ annotation which includes _Table#schema()_ schema}.

This is so that entity tables are organised into an appropriate structure (ideally mirroring that of the entities).

[#every_enum_field_of_jpa_Entity_must_be_annotated_with_Enumerable_STRING__]
=== every_enum_field_of_jpa_Entity_must_be_annotated_with_Enumerable_STRING()

This rule requires that enum fields in classes annotated with the JPA _Entity_ annotation must also be annotated with the JPA _Enumerated_ annotation indicating that they should be persisted as _javax.persistence.EnumType#STRING string_ s (rather than ordinal numbers).

The rationale here is that a string is (arguably) more stable than an ordinal number, and is certainly easier to work with when querying the database. The downside is slightly more space to persist the data, and slightly less performant (not that it would be noticeable).

[#every_injected_field_of_jpa_Entity_must_be_annotated_with_Transient__]
=== every_injected_field_of_jpa_Entity_must_be_annotated_with_Transient()

This rule requires that injected fields in classes annotated with the JPA _Entity_ annotation must also be annotated with JPA _Transient_ annotation.

The rationale here is that injected services are managed by the runtime and are not/cannot be persisted.

[#every_jpa_Entity_must_have_an_id_field__]
=== every_jpa_Entity_must_have_an_id_field()

This rule requires that classes annotated with the JPA _Entity_ annotation must contain an `id` field that is itself annotated with _Id_ .

This is part of the standard contract for JPA entities.

[#every_jpa_Entity_must_have_a_version_field__]
=== every_jpa_Entity_must_have_a_version_field()

This rule requires that classes annotated with the JPA _Entity_ annotation must contain a `version` field that is itself annotated with _javax.persistence.Version_ .

This is good practice for JPA entities to implement optimistic locking

[#every_jpa_Entity_must_have_protected_no_arg_constructor__]
=== every_jpa_Entity_must_have_protected_no_arg_constructor()

This rule requires that concrete classes annotated with the JPA _Entity_ annotation have a no-arg constructor with `protected` visibility.

The rationale is to encourage the use of static factory methods.
