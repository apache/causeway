[#every_jdo_PersistenceCapable_must_be_annotated_with_DomainObject_nature_of_ENTITY_]
=== every_jdo_PersistenceCapable_must_be_annotated_with_DomainObject_nature_of_ENTITY()

This rule requires that classes annotated with the JDO _javax.jdo.annotations.PersistenceCapable_ annotation must also be annotated with the Apache Causeway xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/DomainObject.adoc[DomainObject] annotation specifying that its _DomainObject#nature() nature_ is an _org.apache.causeway.applib.annotation.Nature#ENTITY entity_ .

[#every_jdo_PersistenceCapable_must_be_annotated_with_Version_]
=== every_jdo_PersistenceCapable_must_be_annotated_with_Version()

This rule requires that classes annotated with the JDO _javax.jdo.annotations.PersistenceCapable_ annotation must also be annotated with the JDO _javax.jdo.annotations.Version_ annotation (in support of optimistic locking checks).

The rule does _not_ apply to any entities that are subtype entities where there is a supertype entity.

[#every_jdo_PersistenceCapable_must_be_annotated_as_XmlJavaAdapter_PersistentEntityAdapter_]
=== every_jdo_PersistenceCapable_must_be_annotated_as_XmlJavaAdapter_PersistentEntityAdapter()

This rule requires that classes annotated with the JDO _javax.jdo.annotations.PersistenceCapable_ annotation must also be annotated with the Apache Causeway _jakarta.xml.bind.annotation.adapters.XmlJavaTypeAdapter_ annotation with a value of _org.apache.causeway.applib.jaxb.PersistentEntityAdapter_ `.class` .

Tnis is so that entities can be transparently referenced from XML-style view models.

[#every_jdo_PersistenceCapable_must_implement_Comparable_]
=== every_jdo_PersistenceCapable_must_implement_Comparable()

This rule requires that classes annotated with the JDO _javax.jdo.annotations.PersistenceCapable_ annotation must also implement _Comparable_ .

This is so that entities have a natural ordering and can safely be added to parented collections of type _java.util.SortedSet_ .

[#every_jdo_PersistenceCapable_must_be_annotated_as_Uniques_or_Unique_]
=== every_jdo_PersistenceCapable_must_be_annotated_as_Uniques_or_Unique()

This rule requires that classes annotated with the JDO _javax.jdo.annotations.PersistenceCapable_ annotation and is not a subtype entity, must also be annotated with the JDO _javax.jdo.annotations.Uniques_ or _javax.jdo.annotations.Unique_ constraints.

This is so that entities will have an alternative business key in addition to the system-defined surrogate key.

[#every_jdo_PersistenceCapable_with_DATASTORE_identityType_must_be_annotated_as_DataStoreIdentity_]
=== every_jdo_PersistenceCapable_with_DATASTORE_identityType_must_be_annotated_as_DataStoreIdentity()

This rule requires that classes annotated with the JDO _javax.jdo.annotations.PersistenceCapable_ annotation must also be annotated with the JDO _javax.jdo.annotations.Uniques_ or _javax.jdo.annotations.Unique_ constraints.

This is so that entities will have an alternative business key in addition to the system-defined surrogate key.

The rule does _not_ apply to any entities that are subtype entities where there is a supertype entity.

[#every_jdo_PersistenceCapable_must_have_schema_]
=== every_jdo_PersistenceCapable_must_have_schema()

This rule requires that classes annotated with the JDO _javax.jdo.annotations.PersistenceCapable_ annotation must have the _javax.jdo.annotations.PersistenceCapable#schema() schema_ attribute set.

This is so that entity tables are organised into an appropriate structure (ideally mirroring that of the entities).

[#every_injected_field_of_jdo_PersistenceCapable_must_be_annotated_with_NotPersistent_]
=== every_injected_field_of_jdo_PersistenceCapable_must_be_annotated_with_NotPersistent()

This rule requires that injected fields in classes annotated with the JDO _PersistenceCapable_ annotation must also be annotated with JDO _javax.jdo.annotations.NotPersistent_ annotation.

The rationale here is that injected services are managed by the runtime and are not/cannot be persisted.

In fact, JDO is tolerant to such fields and will not trip up. So another more pragmatic reason is that, if using JDO type-safe queries, then the injected fields will not appear incorrectly in the generated Q classes.
