The `causeway-mavendeps-webapp` aggregates the main runtime dependencies of a production webapp.
Note that it does _not_ include the runtime dependencies for either JDO or JPA; these must be included separately.

To use, add the following :

[source,xml]
.pom.xml
----
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.causeway.mavendeps</groupId>
        <artifactId>causeway-mavendeps-webapp</artifactId>
        <type>pom</type>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

For convenience, it includes:

* Spring Boot (link:https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/getting-started.html#getting-started-first-application-dependencies[spring-boot-starter-web])

* Apache Causeway Core - the xref:refguide:ROOT:about.adoc[Applib] and underlying implementation (the _Runtime Services_ module)

However, it does _not_ include a security implementation, a viewer implementation or a persistence implementation, which you should add as required:

* security, add _one_ of xref:security:shiro:about.adoc[Shiro], xref:security:spring:about.adoc[Spring], xref:security:keycloak:about.adoc[Keycloak] or xref:security:bypass:about.adoc[Bypass] if prototyping

* for persistence, add _one_ of xref:pjpa:ROOT:about.adoc[JPA/Eclipselink] or xref:pjdo:ROOT:about.adoc[JDO/DataNucleus].

* viewer, you will almost certainly want to add xref:vw:ROOT:about.adoc[Wicket] and you might also add xref:vro:ROOT:about.adoc[Restful Objects].

Also, remember that adding the class onto the classpath does _not_ make that functionality available (Apache Causeway does not currently leverage Spring Boot's link:https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/using-spring-boot.html#using-boot-auto-configuration[auto configuration] capabilities).
You must therefore also add in the appropriate `CausewayModuleXxx` to your application's top-level link:https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/Configuration.html[@Configuration] (aka "app manifest").
For example, see the xref:docs:starters:simpleapp.adoc#appmanifest[AppManifest for the SimpleApp] starter app.
