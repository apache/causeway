If your application inherits from the Apache Causeway starter app (`org.apache.causeway.app:causeway-app-starter-parent`) then that will define the version automatically:

[source,xml,subs="attributes+"]
.pom.xml
----
<parent>
    <groupId>org.apache.causeway.app</groupId>
    <artifactId>causeway-app-starter-parent</artifactId>
    <version>{page-causewaypreviousversion}</version>
    <relativePath/>
</parent>
----

Alternatively, import the core BOM.
This is usually done in the top-level parent pom of your application:

[source,xml,subs="attributes+"]
.pom.xml
----
<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.apache.causeway.core</groupId>
            <artifactId>causeway-core</artifactId>
            <version>{page-causewaypreviousversion}</version>
            <scope>import</scope>
            <type>pom</type>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
