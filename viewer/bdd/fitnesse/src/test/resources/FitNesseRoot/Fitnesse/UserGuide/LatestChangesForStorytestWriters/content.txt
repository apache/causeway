 * SelectFixture allows for the use in flow of several DoFixtures to be interleaved
 * Can get into flow part-way through a storytest (but need to use FitLibraryServer)
!2 20080702
 * Added support for defined actions. See .FitLibrary.SpecifiCations.DefinedActions
 * Enabled the use of fixture class names while in flow
 * Included ''!-FitNesse-!'' plugin support for suite fixtures and macros. This means that a ''!-SuiteSetUp-!'' page is run, if it exists up the page hierarchy, when a single storytest is run.

 * When running a suite with ${fitLibrary}, the only report tables shown in full are on the first page and those that don't pass
 * To see the full report for a ${storytest}, run it as a single Test
 * '''Perhaps''' I should provide another fitLibraryServer that doesn't have this behaviour

!3 The three phases of ${workflow}
 * This version enables the three phases of ${workflow} to be made more explicit.
 * With this approach, the structure of tables for setup and checking have changed
  * Tables for setup and checking are based on the notion of property-value pairs, as we see in .FitLibrary.UserGuide.FitLibraryByExample.WorkFlow
!3 Nested Tables
 * The biggest change is the addition of nested tables.
 * See the examples in FitLibraryByExample.
 * These allow ${storytest}s to look more like user interfaces in the way that they're laid out
