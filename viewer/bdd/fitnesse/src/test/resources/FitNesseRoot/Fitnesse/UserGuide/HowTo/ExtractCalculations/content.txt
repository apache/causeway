You may be tempted to copy and paste a ${workflow} storytest to make minor variations on it, such as to show how the calculations that result differ or to show when constraints apply to actions or to input data.

Instead, build calculation tables that focus on the underlying business rule related to the calculations or constraints.

See the ${fitBook} for more on this process.
