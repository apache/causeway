Dynamic variables allow for storytests to take different values, depending on the values that have been defined.

Dynamic variables  can be loaded from a properties file, as well as being set within storytests.

!2 Using Dynamic variables
 * The value of a dynamic variable is accessed using the @{} form. Eg:
|''with''|//input|''set text''|@{simone.name}|
 * They may be nested. Eg:
|''with''|//input|''set text''|@{@{person.manager}.name}|
 * And they may be used within defined actions. Eg, where PERSON is a parameter, the value of the variable is resolved before resolving the dynamic variable value:
|''with''|//input|''set text''|@{PERSON.name}|
 * To show the value of one or more dynamic variables:
|'''show'''|''get''|@{simone.name} with card @{simone.credit card.number}|
 * If a dynamic variable doesn't have a value, the @{} form remains
!2 Changing Dynamic variables
 * Load dynamic variables from a file:
|''add dynamic variables from file''|c:/props.txt|
 * Set a dynamic variable in a storytest:
|'''set'''|simone.name|''to''|Simone|
 * Set several dynamic variables at once in a storytest:
|''set variables''|
|simone.name|Simone|
|simone.credit card.number|41111111|
 * Clear all dynamic properties:
|''clear dynamic variables''|
