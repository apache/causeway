In this example, we show some calculations. Again we keep it very simple, illustrating how an array may be expressed in a comma-separated form and in a table.
!**> test
!define array1 (|1|
|2|
|3|
)
!define array2 (|0|
)

**!
|!-fitlibrary.eg.NestedArray-!|

|''calculate''|
|comma array||array|
|1,2,3||${array1}|
|0||${array2}|

The method ''arrayCommaArray()'' is called for each row. The whole of the ''!-NestedArray-!'' class is as follows:
----{{{public class NestedArray extends DoFixture {
	public int[] arrayCommaArray(int[] array) {
		return array;
	}
}
}}}----
Notice that:
 * The nested table for an array doesn't have a header
 * The fixture is a ''!-DoFixture-!''. We make use of the ''calculate'' action so that the calculations are handled by a ''!-CalculateFixture-!''.
 * The comma-separated list form of the array is handled automatically (''!-FitLibrary-!'' can determine the component-type of the array from the argument of the method ''arrayCommaArray()''
Let's now look at NestedObjects.
