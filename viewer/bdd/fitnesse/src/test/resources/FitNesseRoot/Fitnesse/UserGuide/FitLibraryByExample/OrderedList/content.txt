Let's consider a table for  specifying an ordered list that's expected.
 * The left cell of the table identifies the property (an ordered list)
 * The right cell contains a table for the ordered list:
  * The first row contains the ''labels'', the names of the fields of elements of the list.
  * The rest of the rows contain the expected elements, in order. If there are no elements at all in the collection, there's no further rows
 * This passes:

----
 * Create a list with 4 elements
|list is|1,2,3,4|

|''ordered list''|
|''item''|
|1|
|2|
|3|
|4|
----
 * Here's the list to be checked
|''ordered list''|${list}|
And here's further details:
 * ^OneWithNoElements
 * One ^ThatFails
 * How to include checks within the ${actions} ^CheckInActions
 * The code: CollectionsCode
