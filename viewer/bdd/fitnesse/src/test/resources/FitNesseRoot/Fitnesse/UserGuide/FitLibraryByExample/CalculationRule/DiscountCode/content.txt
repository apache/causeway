Let's start by looking at the code for the previous example, shown in part again:

|!-fitlibrary.eg.Discount-!|

|''actions''|

|''calculate''|
|''$''||''discount''|
|0.00||0.00|
|1000.00||0.00|

The code is as follows:
----{{{  public class Discount {
	public double discountDollar(double dollar) {
		if (dollar <= 1000)
			return 0;
		return dollar * 0.05;
	}
  } }}}----The method ''discountDollar()'' is called for each of the rows. The ${given} value is supplied as an argument to the method and the result is compared to the ${expected} value.

The header ${label}s are used to determine the ${ruleMethod} name. Each of the ${given} column labels is appended to the ${expected} column label ("discount" + "$"). This name is converted into a valid Java method name based on ${extendedCamelCase}. While this can result in some weird method names, it does given the storytest writer considerable freedom of expression.

Such weird names means that a ${domainAdapter} is usually needed with calculation rules.
