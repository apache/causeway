Sometimes in a ${storytest}, we only are interested in some of the elements of a collection. See the ${fitBook} for motivation and examples.

To check for a subset of the actual elements in a collection, we have to do it in the ${actions} part. That's because we need to be explicit that we're only interested in some of the elements of the unordered collection or set.
