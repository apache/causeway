!3 Doing your own processing before and/or after a table has been processsed
For example, it may be necessary to:
 * Open a database connection, socket, file, or browser
 * Start a transaction or session
 * Close a database connection, socket, file, or browser
 * Commit/abort a transaction or session
 * Clean up some objects, data or database tables after a storytest (although it's often not good practice to do this)
Include the methods ''setUp()'' and/or ''tearDown()'' in your class if you want to do this with a table in a storytest.
 * ''setUp()'' is called before the table is processed
 * ''tearDown()'' is called afterwards
However, the first object of a storytest is different. These methods are called before and/or after all of the tables have been processed.
 * ''setUp()'' is called before any of the tables are processed
 * ''tearDown()'' is called after all of the tables have been processed (or after it is prematurely stopped)
It's also possible to do before and after processing across a suite of storytests. See ${suite}.
