Let's start with a simple example, computing the discount. The general rule can be stated as: ''If the amount is more than $1000.00, the discount is 5%'':

----
|''calculate''|
|''$''||''discount''|
|0.00||0.00|
|1000.00||0.00|
|1010.00||50.50|
|1100.00||55.00|
|1200.00||60.00|
|2000.00||100.00|
 * We start with a table that identifies the domain.
 * The second table defines the calculation rules
In the second table:
 * The first row simply specifies that we're defining calculations
 * The second row has the labels. The ''given'' label on the left of the empty column is the "$" amount. The ''expected'' label on the right of the empty column is "discount".
 * The third row, and thereafter, independently specify an example of the calculation rule
 * The third row specifies that if the "$" amount is 0.00, the expected "discount" is 0.00.
 * The 5th row specified that if the "$" amount is 1010.00, the expected "discount" is 55.00.
In general:
 * There can be any number of ''given'' and ''expected'' columns
 * The values need not be numbers.
Here's the corresponding DiscountCode.
