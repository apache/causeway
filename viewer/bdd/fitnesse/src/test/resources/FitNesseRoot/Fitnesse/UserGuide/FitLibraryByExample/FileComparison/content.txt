FileComparison takes two files or two directories and compares them. The differences is presented as an HTML list, showing the structure (but only enough to show differences). This list includes links to the files concerned.

!2 Absolute file names
''!-CompareFileFixture-!'' now handles absolute file names as well as relative file names. A file name is treated as absolute if it starts with "/" or has ":" as the second character. Examples of absolute file names:
 * "/tmp/generatedFile"
 * "C:\Documents and Settings\Me\My Documents\generatedDirectory".
