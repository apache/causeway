----
 * Create a list with 4 elements
|list is|1,2,3,4|
----
 * Here's the list to be checked, but it fails
|''ordered list''|${list}|
----The following specifies the expected counts of passes, fails, etc for the page. This is used here to avoid manually checking, as here the storytests are written to fail. You'll most probably not use this technique, as you'd expect all your storytests to pass. It's possible to specify that certain failures are expected (see .FitLibrary.UserGuide.FitLibraryByExample.WorkFlow.WhenActionsFail).
