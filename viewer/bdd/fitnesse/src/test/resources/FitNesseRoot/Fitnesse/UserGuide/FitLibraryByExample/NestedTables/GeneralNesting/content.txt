Nested tables may be used in general with ''!-FitLibrary-!'' fixtures. Tables may be nested to arbitrary level, and mixed in arbitrary ways.
!3 When an expected value is a collection, array or object
In this case, the actual value is checked against the expected value, by colouring the nested table. Eg:
 * As the ''check'' value in a ''!-DoFixture-!'' action
 * In a value in a checked collection, set, array or map
 * In a property check with ''!-DomainObjectCheckFixture-!''
 * As the expected value in a ''!-CalculationFixture-!'' table
!3 When a given (or supplied) value is a collection, array or object.
In this case, the value is set up from the data in the nested table. Eg:
 * In a parameter value in a ''!-DoFixture-!'' action
 * In a property set with ''!-DomainObjectSetUpFixture-!''
 * As a ''given'' in a ''!-CalculationFixture-!'' table
!3 Setup Tables and Methods
 * Consider when a setup method is needed when ''!-FitLibrary-!'' runs, but it doesn't yet exist. An error message gives the method name and the arguments required, as well as the class in which the method needs to appear.
 * When a etup table is nested several levels deep, the setup method is expected in the fixture at the top level.
