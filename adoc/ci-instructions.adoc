One can setup a gitlab repository just for the purpose of 
building and deploying _Causeway_ artifacts.

A minimal build script could look like:

[source,yaml]
..gitlab-ci.yml
----
image: maven:3.9.12-eclipse-temurin-25

include:
  - local: ci/causeway-v2.yml
  - local: ci/isis-v2.yml

stages:
  - checkout-patch-deploy
----

where the actual jobs are declared in their own files in the `ci` directory: 

TODO flesh out `ci/causeway-v2.yml`

TODO flesh out `ci/isis-v2.yml`
