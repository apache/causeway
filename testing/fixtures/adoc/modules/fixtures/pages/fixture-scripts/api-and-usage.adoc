Fixture scripts are used to set up the system into a known state, which almost always means to populate the database.
The most common use case is for integration testing, but they are also useful while prototyping/demo'ing.
In both cases the system is almost always running against an in-memory database, meaning that the entire state of the system needs to be setup.
As it wouldn't be scalable to have one huge fixture script for this purpose, fixture scripts are usually organised hierarchically, with higher-level fixture scripts calling child fixture scripts that set up the
individual parts the system (eg rows into a specific entity).

Fixture scripts are usually implemented by calling the business logic of the domain application.
This is preferable to, for example, ``INSERT``ing rows directly into database tables, because they are robust to implementation changes over time.

Fixture scripts are implemented by subclassing from the xref:refguide:testing:index/fixtures/applib/fixturescripts/FixtureScript.adoc[FixtureScript] abstract class.
In most cases you'll want to use one of the variants provided by the framework; these are described in more detail <<fixturescript, below>>.

Fixture scripts are executed using the  xref:refguide:testing:index/fixtures/applib/fixturescripts/FixtureScripts.adoc[FixtureScripts] domain service class.
This provides menu actions in the UI of your application (when running in prototype mode).
Typically it will only make sense for a small subset of the available fixture scripts to be exposed through the UI, for example those representing scenarios to be explored/demo'ed.
The behaviour of the `FixtureScripts` domain service and the discovery of scenario fixture scripts is managed by configuration properties.

Let's look at `FixtureScripts` domain service in more detail <<fixturescripts,first>>, <<fixturescript, then>> move onto exploring `FixtureScript`.

[#fixturescripts]
== `FixtureScripts`

The xref:refguide:testing:index/fixtures/applib/fixturescripts/FixtureScripts.adoc[FixtureScripts] domain service.
This is annotated to be part of on the secondary "Prototyping" menu.


Here's how the domain service looks like in the UI:

image::prototyping-menu.png[width="700px"]

and here's what the `runFixtureScript` action prompt looks like:

image::prompt.png[width="700px"]


when this is executed, the resultant objects (actually, instances of FixtureResult`) are shown in the UI:

image::result-list.png[width="700px"]


The `FixtureScripts` domain service also provides the `recreateObjectsAndReturnFirst` action.
This is a convenience, saving a few clicks: it will run a nominated fixture script and return the first object created by that fixture script.


=== Configuration Properties

The behaviour of this domain menu service can be configured using the `causeway.testing.fixtures.fixture-script-specification` configuration properties.
For example, here's the configuration used by the xref:docs:starters:simpleapp.adoc[SimpleApp] starter apps:

[source,java]
.application.yml
----
causeway:
  testing:
    fixtures:
      fixture-scripts-specification:
        context-class: domainapp.webapp.application.fixture.scenarios.DomainAppDemo # <.>
        multiple-execution-strategy: execute # <.>
        run-script-default: domainapp.webapp.application.fixture.scenarios.DomainAppDemo # <.>
        recreate: domainapp.webapp.application.fixture.scenarios.DomainAppDemo # <.>
    }
}
----
<.> search for all fixture scripts under the package containing this class
<.> if the same fixture script (class) is encountered more than once, then run anyway.
<.> specify the fixture script class to provide as the default for the service's "run fixture script" action
<.> if present, enables a "recreate objects and return first" action to be displayed in the UI

For more details, see xref:refguide:config:sections/causeway.testing.adoc#causeway.testing.fixtures.fixture-scripts-specification.context-class[causeway.testing.fixtures.fixture-scripts-specification] config properties in the configuration guide.


=== Menubars

The actions of ``FixtureScripts`` domain service are automatically placed on the "Prototyping" menu.
This can be fine-tuned using `menubars.layout.xml`:

[source,xml]
.menubars.layout.xml
----
<mb3:section>
    <mb3:named>Fixtures</mb3:named>
    <mb3:serviceAction
        objectType="causeway.testing.fixtures.FixtureScripts"
        id="runFixtureScript"/>
    <mb3:serviceAction
        objectType="causeway.testing.fixtures.FixtureScripts"
        id="recreateObjectsAndReturnFirst"/>
</mb3:section>
----

Let's now look at the `FixtureScript` class, where there's a bit more to discuss.

[#fixturescript]
== `FixtureScript`

A xref:refguide:testing:index/fixtures/applib/fixturescripts/FixtureScript.adoc[FixtureScript] is responsible for setting up the system (or more likely, one small part of the overall system) into a known state, either for prototyping or for integration testing.

The normal idiom is for the fixture script to invoke actions on business objects, in essence to replay what a real-life user would have done.
That way, the fixture script will remain valid even if the underlying implementation of the system changes in the future.

For example, here's a fixture script called `RecreateSimpleObjects`.
(This used to be part of the xref:docs:starters:simpleapp.adoc[SimpleApp] starter app, though it now has a more sophisticated design, discussed below):

[source,java]
----
import lombok.Accessors;
import lombok.Getter;
import lombok.Setter;

@Accessors(chain = true)
public class RecreateSimpleObjects extends FixtureScript {       // <.>

    public final List<String> NAMES =
        Collections.unmodifiableList(Arrays.asList(
            "Foo", "Bar", "Baz", "Frodo", "Froyo",
            "Fizz", "Bip", "Bop", "Bang", "Boo"));               // <.>
    public RecreateSimpleObjects() {
        withDiscoverability(Discoverability.DISCOVERABLE);       // <.>
    }

    @Getter @Setter
    private Integer number;                                      // <.>

    @Getter
    private final List<SimpleObject> simpleObjects =
                                        Lists.newArrayList();    // <.>

    @Override
    protected void execute(final ExecutionContext ec) {          // <.>

        // defaults
        final int number = defaultParam("number", ec, 3);        // <.>

        // validate
        if(number < 0 || number > NAMES.size()) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException(
                String.format("number must be in range [0,%d)", NAMES.size()));
        }

        // execute
        ec.executeChild(this, new SimpleObjectsTearDown());      // <.>
        for (int i = 0; i < number; i++) {
            final SimpleObjectCreate fs =
                new SimpleObjectCreate().setName(NAMES.get(i));
            ec.executeChild(this, fs.getName(), fs);             // <.>
            simpleObjects.add(fs.getSimpleObject());             // <.>
        }
    }
}
----
<.> inherit from xref:refguide:testing:index/fixtures/applib/fixturescripts/FixtureScript.adoc[FixtureScript]
<.> a hard-coded list of values for the names.
Note that the xref:testing:fakedata:about.adoc[Fakedata] testing module could also have been used
<.> whether the script is "discoverable"; in other words whether it should be rendered in the drop-down by the xref:refguide:testing:index/fixtures/applib/fixturescripts/FixtureScripts.adoc[FixtureScripts] domain service
<.> input property: the number of objects to create, up to 10; for the calling test to specify, but note this is optional and has a default (see below).
It's important that a wrapper class is used (ie `java.lang.Integer`, not `int`)
<.> output property: the generated list of objects, for the calling test to grab
<.> the mandatory `execute(...)` API.
The xref:refguide:testing:index/fixtures/applib/fixturescripts/FixtureScript_ExecutionContext.adoc[ExecutionContext] parameter is discussed in more detail in the <<executioncontext,next section>>.
<.> the `defaultParam(...)` (inherited from `FixtureScript`) will default the `number` property (using Java's Reflection API) if none was specified
<.> call another fixture script (`SimpleObjectsTearDown`) using the provided xref:refguide:testing:index/fixtures/applib/fixturescripts/FixtureScript_ExecutionContext.adoc[ExecutionContext].
There's no need to instantiate using the xref:refguide:applib:index/services/factory/FactoryService.adoc[FactoryService].
<.> calling another fixture script (`SimpleObjectCreate`) using the provided xref:refguide:testing:index/fixtures/applib/fixturescripts/FixtureScript_ExecutionContext.adoc[ExecutionContext]
<.> adding the created object to the list, for the calling object to use.

Because this script has exposed a "number" property, it's possible to set this from within the UI.
For example:

image::prompt-specifying-number.png[width="700px"]

When this is executed, the framework will parse the text and attempt to reflectively set the corresponding properties on the fixture result.
So, in this case, when the fixture script is executed we actually get 6 objects created.


[#executioncontext]
== ExecutionContext

The xref:refguide:testing:index/fixtures/applib/fixturescripts/FixtureScript_ExecutionContext.adoc[ExecutionContext] is passed to each `FixtureScript` as it is executed.
It supports two main use cases:

* to allow child fixture scripts to be executed, using xref:refguide:testing:index/fixtures/applib/fixturescripts/FixtureScript_ExecutionContext.adoc#executeChildT_FixtureScript_T[executeChild(...)] and its brethren.
+
This was demonstrated in the <<fixturescript, previous section>>

* to read parameters obtained when the fixture script was first executed by the xref:refguide:testing:index/fixtures/applib/fixturescripts/FixtureScripts.adoc[FixtureScripts] domain service, discussed <<fixturescripts, above>>.

The latter use case is much less frequently used, but can be helpful for example in demos, where the number of objects can be specified in the `parameters` parameter of the xref:refguide:testing:index/fixtures/applib/fixturescripts/FixtureScripts.adoc#runFixtureScript_String_String[run fixture script] action.


== Personas and Builders

Good integration tests are probably the best way to understand the behaviour of the domain model: better, even, than reading the code itself.
This requires though that the tests are as minimal as possible so that the developer reading the test knows that everything mentioned in the test is essential to the functionality under test.

At the same time, "Persona" instances of entity classes help the developer become familiar with the data being set up.
For example, "Steve Single" the Customer might be 21, single and no kids, whereas vs "Meghan Married-Mum" the Customer might be married 35 with 2 kids.
Using "Steve" vs "Meghan" immediately informs the developer about the particular scenario being explored.

The xref:refguide:testing:index/fixtures/applib/personas/Persona.adoc[Persona] interfaces is intended to be implemented typically by "persona" enums, where each enum instance captures the essential data of some persona.
xref:refguide:testing:index/fixtures/applib/personas/Persona.adoc[Persona] in turn unifies two lower-level interfaces, xref:refguide:testing:index/fixtures/applib/personas/PersonaWithBuilderScript.adoc[PersonaWithBuilderScript] and
xref:refguide:testing:index/fixtures/applib/personas/PersonaWithFinder.adoc[PersonaWithFinder].

So, going back to the previous example, we might have:

[source,xml]
.Customer_persona.java
----
@Getter
@RequiredArgsConstructor
public enum Customer_persona
        implements Persona<Customer, CustomerBuilderScript> {

    SteveSingle(1, "Steve", "Single", 21),
    MeghanMarriedMum(2, "Meghan", "Married-Mum", 35);

    private final int id;
    private final String firstName;
    private final String lastName;
    private final int age;

    @Override
    public CustomerBuilderScript builder() {                            // <.>
        return new CustomerBuilderScript(this);                         // <.>
    }

    @Override
    public Customer findUsing(ServiceRegistry serviceRegistry) {        // <.>
        return serviceRegistry.lookupServiceElseFail(CustomerRepository.class).findById(id).orElseThrow();
    }

}
----
<.> from xref:refguide:testing:index/fixtures/applib/personas/PersonaWithBuilderScript.adoc[PersonaWithBuilderScript]
<.> it's idiomatic to just pass self to the build script.
<.> from xref:refguide:testing:index/fixtures/applib/personas/PersonaWithFinder.adoc[PersonaWithFinder]

Here the `CustomerBuilderScript` is a subclass of xref:refguide:testing:index/fixtures/applib/personas/BuilderScriptAbstract.adoc[BuilderScriptAbstract],  a specialized fixture script that acts as a factory of the domain object (`Customer`, in this case), usig the data taken out of the enum instance.
In many cases a builder script will create a single top-level object, so the related xref:refguide:testing:index/fixtures/applib/personas/BuilderScriptWithResult.adoc[BuilderScriptWithResult] removes some boilerplate:

[source,java]
.CustomerBuilderScript.java
----
@RequiredArgsConstructor
public class CustomerBuilderScript extends BuilderScriptWithResult<Customer> {

    private final Customer_persona persona;

    @Override
    protected Customer buildResult(ExecutionContext ec) {
        return customerRepository.create(persona.getFirstName(), persona.getLastName(), persona.getAge());
    }

    @Inject CustomerRepository customerRepository;
}
----

Put together, the persona enums provide the "what" - hard-coded values for certain key data that the developer becomes very familiar with - while the builder provides the "how-to".


=== Using within a Scenario Fixture Script

With these definitions in place, the payback is that within the context of a parent fixture script, a new domain object can be easily built and retrieved later:

[source,java]
.ScenarioFixtureScript.java
----
public class ScenarioFixtureScript extends FixtureScript {

    @Override
    protected void execute(ExecutionContext executionContext) {

        // build it ..
        Customer steve = Customer_persona.SteveSingle.build(this, executionContext);

        // ... look it up
        Customer steve2 = Customer_persona.SteveSingle.findUsing(serviceRegistry);
    }
}
----

It's also possible to use personas (or indeed any fixture scripts) from integration tests.
This is discussed in the next section.



=== Using within Tests

Fixture scripts can be called from integration tests just the same way that fixture scripts can call one another.

Using the example persona from the previous section, we can use the xref:refguide:testing:index/fixtures/applib/fixturescripts/FixtureScripts.adoc[FixtureScripts] domain service to build the fixture.

[source,java]
.Customer_IntegTest.java
----
public class Customer_IntegTest {

    @Inject FixtureScripts fixtureScripts;
    @Inject ServiceRegistry serviceRegistry;

    @BeforeEach
    public void setup() {

        // build ...
        Customer steve = fixtureScripts.runPersona(Customer_persona.SteveSingle);       // <.>

    }

    @Test
    public void update_customer() {

        // ... look it up
        Customer steve = Customer_persona.SteveSingle.findUsing(serviceRegistry);   // <.>
    }
}
----
<.> runs a persona fixture script
<.> looks up the domain object.
An alternative design would be to simply store the domain object as a field.


=== More sophisticated use cases

Although its idiomatic for builder scripts (xref:refguide:testing:index/fixtures/applib/personas/BuilderScriptAbstract.adoc[BuilderScriptAbstract] implementations) and persona enums to come in pairs, there's no requirement to do so; builder scripts  can be used independently of the enum personas.
And for more complex entity -where there might be many potential values that need to be provided
- the builder script can automatically default some or even all of these values.

For example, for a customer's date of birth, the builder could default to a date making the customer an adult, aged between 18 and 65, say.
For an email address or postal address, or an image, or some "lorem ipsum" text, the xref:testing:fakedata:about.adoc[Fakedata] testing module could provide randomised values.

The benefit of an intelligent builder is that it further simplifies the test.
The developer reading the test then knows that everything that has been specified exactly is of significance.
Because non-specified values are randomised and change on each run, it also decreases the chance that the test passes "by accident" (based on some lucky hard-coded input value).
