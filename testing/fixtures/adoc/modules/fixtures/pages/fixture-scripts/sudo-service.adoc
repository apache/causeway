Sometimes in our fixture scripts we want to perform a business action running as a particular user.
This might be for the usual reason - so that our fixtures accurately reflect the reality of the system with all business constraints enforced using the `WrapperFactory` - or more straightforwardly it might be simply that the action depends on the identity of the user invoking the action.

For example, consider this code that creates a todo item:

[source,java]
.Production code that depends on current user
----
// annotations omitted for clarity
public ToDoItem newToDo(
        final String description,
        final Category category,
        final Subcategory subcategory,
        final LocalDate dueBy,
        final BigDecimal cost) {
    return newToDo(description, category, subcategory, currentUserName(), dueBy, cost);
}
private String currentUserName() {
    return container.getUser().getName();       // <1>
}
----
<1> is the current user.

The fixture for this can use the `SudoService` to run a block of code as a specified user:

[source,java]
.Fixture Script
----
final String description = ...
final Category category = ...
final Subcategory subcategory = ...
final LocalDate dueBy = ...
final BigDecimal cost = ...
final Location location = ...

toDoItem = sudoService.sudo(username,
        new Callable<ToDoItem>() {
            @Override
            public ToDoItem call() {
                final ToDoItem toDoItem = wrap(toDoItems).newToDo(
                        description, category, subcategory, dueBy, cost);
                wrap(toDoItem).setLocation(location);
                return toDoItem;
            }
        });
----

Behind the scenes the `SudoService` simply talks to the `UserService` to override the user returned by the `getUser()` API.
It is possible to override both users and roles.
