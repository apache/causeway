The `FixtureScripts` service provides the ability to execute xref:fixtures:ROOT:about.adoc#api-and-usage[fixture scripts].

The service is typically configured using the `isis.testing.fixtures.fixture-scripts-specification` configuration properties, for example telling it which package to search for xref:refguide:testing:index/ classes, how to execute those classes, and hints that influence the UI.



== API

The API for the service is:

[source,java]
----
public abstract class FixtureScripts ... {
    @Programmatic
    public List<FixtureResult> runFixtureScript(
        FixtureScript fixtureScript,
        String parameters) { /* ... */ }
}
----
