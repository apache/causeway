/**
 * Use to execute integration tests with permission checking disabled, with a user that has
 * the {@link SudoService#ACCESS_ALL_ROLE ACCESS_ALL_ROLE} role.
 *
 * <p>
 * This can be useful for example if working with code that depends on the secman extension,
 * where normally this activates the secman authorizor necessitating users and roles to be seeded and then
 * to run interact using an appropriate user.  Instead of all that, this extension effectively just
 * disables permission checking.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 *     To use, annotate integration test class using <code>@ExtendWith(NoPermissionChecks.class)</code>
