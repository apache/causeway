The xref:refguide:applib:index/services/swagger/SwaggerService.adoc[SwaggerService] serializes the domain's meta model as a Swagger 2.0 specification, either as JSON or YAML.
The `SwaggerExporter` in turn is a utility class that simply writes this serialization out to a file from within an integration test.
The idea is that subsequent jobs in the build process could then pick up this file, typically to code-generation REST clients in other languages.

The example below is taken from the xref:docs:starters:simpleapp.adoc[simpleapp] starter app:

[source,java]
.SwaggerExport_IntegTest.java
----
@SpringBootTest(
    classes = {
        ApplicationIntegTestAbstract.AppManifest.class,             // <1>
        CausewayModuleViewerRestfulObjectsJaxrsResteasy4.class          // <2>
    }
)
class SwaggerExport_IntegTest extends ApplicationIntegTestAbstract {

    @Inject ServiceRegistry serviceRegistry;

    @Test
    void export() throws IOException {
        val swaggerExporter = new SwaggerExporter(serviceRegistry); // <3>
        swaggerExporter.export(
                            SwaggerService.Visibility.PRIVATE,      // <4>
                            SwaggerService.Format.JSON);            // <4>
    }
}
----
<1> bootstrap using the usual `AppManifest` for integration tests ...
<2> \... and _also_ include the xref:vro:ROOT:about.adoc[Restful Objects] viewer because this contains the implementation of xref:refguide:applib:index/services/swagger/SwaggerService.adoc[SwaggerService].
<3> instantiate the `SwaggerExporter` utility class
<4> Export specifies the required visibility and format.

By default the file will be written to `target/generated-resources/swagger-export`.
Overloads of the `export(...)` method allow this to be changed as required.
