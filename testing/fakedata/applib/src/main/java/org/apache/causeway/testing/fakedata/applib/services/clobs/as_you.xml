<STAGEDIR>Enter ORLANDO and ADAM</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion</LINE>
<LINE>bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns,</LINE>
<LINE>and, as thou sayest, charged my brother, on his</LINE>
<LINE>blessing, to breed me well: and there begins my</LINE>
<LINE>sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and</LINE>
<LINE>report speaks goldenly of his profit: for my part,</LINE>
<LINE>he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more</LINE>
<LINE>properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you</LINE>
<LINE>that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that</LINE>
<LINE>differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses</LINE>
<LINE>are bred better; for, besides that they are fair</LINE>
<LINE>with their feeding, they are taught their manage,</LINE>
<LINE>and to that end riders dearly hired: but I, his</LINE>
<LINE>brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for the</LINE>
<LINE>which his animals on his dunghills are as much</LINE>
<LINE>bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so</LINE>
<LINE>plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave</LINE>
<LINE>me his countenance seems to take from me: he lets</LINE>
<LINE>me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a</LINE>
<LINE>brother, and, as much as in him lies, mines my</LINE>
<LINE>gentility with my education. This is it, Adam, that</LINE>
<LINE>grieves me; and the spirit of my father, which I</LINE>
<LINE>think is within me, begins to mutiny against this</LINE>
<LINE>servitude: I will no longer endure it, though yet I</LINE>
<LINE>know no wise remedy how to avoid it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yonder comes my master, your brother.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go apart, Adam, and thou shalt hear how he will</LINE>
<LINE>shake me up.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter OLIVER</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLIVER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, sir! what make you here?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nothing: I am not taught to make any thing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLIVER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What mar you then, sir?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, sir, I am helping you to mar that which God</LINE>
<LINE>made, a poor unworthy brother of yours, with idleness.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLIVER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, sir, be better employed, and be naught awhile.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Shall I keep your hogs and eat husks with them?</LINE>
<LINE>What prodigal portion have I spent, that I should</LINE>
<LINE>come to such penury?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLIVER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Know you where your are, sir?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, sir, very well; here in your orchard.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLIVER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Know you before whom, sir?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, better than him I am before knows me. I know</LINE>
<LINE>you are my eldest brother; and, in the gentle</LINE>
<LINE>condition of blood, you should so know me. The</LINE>
<LINE>courtesy of nations allows you my better, in that</LINE>
<LINE>you are the first-born; but the same tradition</LINE>
<LINE>takes not away my blood, were there twenty brothers</LINE>
<LINE>betwixt us: I have as much of my father in me as</LINE>
<LINE>you; albeit, I confess, your coming before me is</LINE>
<LINE>nearer to his reverence.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLIVER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, boy!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, come, elder brother, you are too young in this.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLIVER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Wilt thou lay hands on me, villain?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am no villain; I am the youngest son of Sir</LINE>
<LINE>Rowland de Boys; he was my father, and he is thrice</LINE>
<LINE>a villain that says such a father begot villains.</LINE>
<LINE>Wert thou not my brother, I would not take this hand</LINE>
<LINE>from thy throat till this other had pulled out thy</LINE>
<LINE>tongue for saying so: thou hast railed on thyself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sweet masters, be patient: for your father's</LINE>
<LINE>remembrance, be at accord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLIVER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let me go, I say.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will not, till I please: you shall hear me. My</LINE>
<LINE>father charged you in his will to give me good</LINE>
<LINE>education: you have trained me like a peasant,</LINE>
<LINE>obscuring and hiding from me all gentleman-like</LINE>
<LINE>qualities. The spirit of my father grows strong in</LINE>
<LINE>me, and I will no longer endure it: therefore allow</LINE>
<LINE>me such exercises as may become a gentleman, or</LINE>
<LINE>give me the poor allottery my father left me by</LINE>
<LINE>testament; with that I will go buy my fortunes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLIVER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And what wilt thou do? beg, when that is spent?</LINE>
<LINE>Well, sir, get you in: I will not long be troubled</LINE>
<LINE>with you; you shall have some part of your will: I</LINE>
<LINE>pray you, leave me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will no further offend you than becomes me for my good.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLIVER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Get you with him, you old dog.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is 'old dog' my reward? Most true, I have lost my</LINE>
<LINE>teeth in your service. God be with my old master!</LINE>
<LINE>he would not have spoke such a word.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt ORLANDO and ADAM</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLIVER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is it even so? begin you to grow upon me? I will</LINE>
<LINE>physic your rankness, and yet give no thousand</LINE>
<LINE>crowns neither. Holla, Dennis!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>Calls your worship?</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLIVER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Was not Charles, the duke's wrestler, here to speak with me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DENNIS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So please you, he is here at the door and importunes</LINE>
<LINE>access to you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLIVER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Call him in.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit DENNIS</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>'Twill be a good way; and to-morrow the wrestling is.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter CHARLES</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good morrow to your worship.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLIVER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good Monsieur Charles, what's the new news at the</LINE>
<LINE>new court?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There's no news at the court, sir, but the old news:</LINE>
<LINE>that is, the old duke is banished by his younger</LINE>
<LINE>brother the new duke; and three or four loving lords</LINE>
<LINE>have put themselves into voluntary exile with him,</LINE>
<LINE>whose lands and revenues enrich the new duke;</LINE>
<LINE>therefore he gives them good leave to wander.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLIVER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Can you tell if Rosalind, the duke's daughter, be</LINE>
<LINE>banished with her father?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, no; for the duke's daughter, her cousin, so loves</LINE>
<LINE>her, being ever from their cradles bred together,</LINE>
<LINE>that she would have followed her exile, or have died</LINE>
<LINE>to stay behind her. She is at the court, and no</LINE>
<LINE>less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter; and</LINE>
<LINE>never two ladies loved as they do.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLIVER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where will the old duke live?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They say he is already in the forest of Arden, and</LINE>
<LINE>a many merry men with him; and there they live like</LINE>
<LINE>the old Robin Hood of England: they say many young</LINE>
<LINE>gentlemen flock to him every day, and fleet the time</LINE>
<LINE>carelessly, as they did in the golden world.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLIVER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, you wrestle to-morrow before the new duke?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, do I, sir; and I came to acquaint you with a</LINE>
<LINE>matter. I am given, sir, secretly to understand</LINE>
<LINE>that your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition</LINE>
<LINE>to come in disguised against me to try a fall.</LINE>
<LINE>To-morrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit; and he that</LINE>
<LINE>escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him</LINE>
<LINE>well. Your brother is but young and tender; and,</LINE>
<LINE>for your love, I would be loath to foil him, as I</LINE>
<LINE>must, for my own honour, if he come in: therefore,</LINE>
<LINE>out of my love to you, I came hither to acquaint you</LINE>
<LINE>withal, that either you might stay him from his</LINE>
<LINE>intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall</LINE>
<LINE>run into, in that it is a thing of his own search</LINE>
<LINE>and altogether against my will.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLIVER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Charles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which</LINE>
<LINE>thou shalt find I will most kindly requite. I had</LINE>
<LINE>myself notice of my brother's purpose herein and</LINE>
<LINE>have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from</LINE>
<LINE>it, but he is resolute. I'll tell thee, Charles:</LINE>
<LINE>it is the stubbornest young fellow of France, full</LINE>
<LINE>of ambition, an envious emulator of every man's</LINE>
<LINE>good parts, a secret and villanous contriver against</LINE>
<LINE>me his natural brother: therefore use thy</LINE>
<LINE>discretion; I had as lief thou didst break his neck</LINE>
<LINE>as his finger. And thou wert best look to't; for if</LINE>
<LINE>thou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not</LINE>
<LINE>mightily grace himself on thee, he will practise</LINE>
<LINE>against thee by poison, entrap thee by some</LINE>
<LINE>treacherous device and never leave thee till he</LINE>
<LINE>hath ta'en thy life by some indirect means or other;</LINE>
<LINE>for, I assure thee, and almost with tears I speak</LINE>
<LINE>it, there is not one so young and so villanous this</LINE>
<LINE>day living. I speak but brotherly of him; but</LINE>
<LINE>should I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must</LINE>
<LINE>blush and weep and thou must look pale and wonder.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he come</LINE>
<LINE>to-morrow, I'll give him his payment: if ever he go</LINE>
<LINE>alone again, I'll never wrestle for prize more: and</LINE>
<LINE>so God keep your worship!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLIVER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Farewell, good Charles.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit CHARLES</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Now will I stir this gamester: I hope I shall see</LINE>
<LINE>an end of him; for my soul, yet I know not why,</LINE>
<LINE>hates nothing more than he. Yet he's gentle, never</LINE>
<LINE>schooled and yet learned, full of noble device, of</LINE>
<LINE>all sorts enchantingly beloved, and indeed so much</LINE>
<LINE>in the heart of the world, and especially of my own</LINE>
<LINE>people, who best know him, that I am altogether</LINE>
<LINE>misprised: but it shall not be so long; this</LINE>
<LINE>wrestler shall clear all: nothing remains but that</LINE>
<LINE>I kindle the boy thither; which now I'll go about.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>
</SCENE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE II.  Lawn before the Duke's palace.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter CELIA and ROSALIND</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Dear Celia, I show more mirth than I am mistress of;</LINE>
<LINE>and would you yet I were merrier? Unless you could</LINE>
<LINE>teach me to forget a banished father, you must not</LINE>
<LINE>learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Herein I see thou lovest me not with the full weight</LINE>
<LINE>that I love thee. If my uncle, thy banished father,</LINE>
<LINE>had banished thy uncle, the duke my father, so thou</LINE>
<LINE>hadst been still with me, I could have taught my</LINE>
<LINE>love to take thy father for mine: so wouldst thou,</LINE>
<LINE>if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously</LINE>
<LINE>tempered as mine is to thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, I will forget the condition of my estate, to</LINE>
<LINE>rejoice in yours.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You know my father hath no child but I, nor none is</LINE>
<LINE>like to have: and, truly, when he dies, thou shalt</LINE>
<LINE>be his heir, for what he hath taken away from thy</LINE>
<LINE>father perforce, I will render thee again in</LINE>
<LINE>affection; by mine honour, I will; and when I break</LINE>
<LINE>that oath, let me turn monster: therefore, my</LINE>
<LINE>sweet Rose, my dear Rose, be merry.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>From henceforth I will, coz, and devise sports. Let</LINE>
<LINE>me see; what think you of falling in love?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, I prithee, do, to make sport withal: but</LINE>
<LINE>love no man in good earnest; nor no further in sport</LINE>
<LINE>neither than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst</LINE>
<LINE>in honour come off again.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What shall be our sport, then?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from</LINE>
<LINE>her wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would we could do so, for her benefits are</LINE>
<LINE>mightily misplaced, and the bountiful blind woman</LINE>
<LINE>doth most mistake in her gifts to women.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis true; for those that she makes fair she scarce</LINE>
<LINE>makes honest, and those that she makes honest she</LINE>
<LINE>makes very ill-favouredly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, now thou goest from Fortune's office to</LINE>
<LINE>Nature's: Fortune reigns in gifts of the world,</LINE>
<LINE>not in the lineaments of Nature.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter TOUCHSTONE</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No? when Nature hath made a fair creature, may she</LINE>
<LINE>not by Fortune fall into the fire? Though Nature</LINE>
<LINE>hath given us wit to flout at Fortune, hath not</LINE>
<LINE>Fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Indeed, there is Fortune too hard for Nature, when</LINE>
<LINE>Fortune makes Nature's natural the cutter-off of</LINE>
<LINE>Nature's wit.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Peradventure this is not Fortune's work neither, but</LINE>
<LINE>Nature's; who perceiveth our natural wits too dull</LINE>
<LINE>to reason of such goddesses and hath sent this</LINE>
<LINE>natural for our whetstone; for always the dulness of</LINE>
<LINE>the fool is the whetstone of the wits. How now,</LINE>
<LINE>wit! whither wander you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Mistress, you must come away to your father.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Were you made the messenger?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, by mine honour, but I was bid to come for you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where learned you that oath, fool?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Of a certain knight that swore by his honour they</LINE>
<LINE>were good pancakes and swore by his honour the</LINE>
<LINE>mustard was naught: now I'll stand to it, the</LINE>
<LINE>pancakes were naught and the mustard was good, and</LINE>
<LINE>yet was not the knight forsworn.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How prove you that, in the great heap of your</LINE>
<LINE>knowledge?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, marry, now unmuzzle your wisdom.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Stand you both forth now: stroke your chins, and</LINE>
<LINE>swear by your beards that I am a knave.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By our beards, if we had them, thou art.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By my knavery, if I had it, then I were; but if you</LINE>
<LINE>swear by that that is not, you are not forsworn: no</LINE>
<LINE>more was this knight swearing by his honour, for he</LINE>
<LINE>never had any; or if he had, he had sworn it away</LINE>
<LINE>before ever he saw those pancakes or that mustard.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Prithee, who is't that thou meanest?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>One that old Frederick, your father, loves.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My father's love is enough to honour him: enough!</LINE>
<LINE>speak no more of him; you'll be whipped for taxation</LINE>
<LINE>one of these days.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The more pity, that fools may not speak wisely what</LINE>
<LINE>wise men do foolishly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By my troth, thou sayest true; for since the little</LINE>
<LINE>wit that fools have was silenced, the little foolery</LINE>
<LINE>that wise men have makes a great show. Here comes</LINE>
<LINE>Monsieur Le Beau.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With his mouth full of news.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Which he will put on us, as pigeons feed their young.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then shall we be news-crammed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>All the better; we shall be the more marketable.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter LE BEAU</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Bon jour, Monsieur Le Beau: what's the news?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LE BEAU</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fair princess, you have lost much good sport.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sport! of what colour?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LE BEAU</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What colour, madam! how shall I answer you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As wit and fortune will.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Or as the Destinies decree.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well said: that was laid on with a trowel.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, if I keep not my rank,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou losest thy old smell.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LE BEAU</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You amaze me, ladies: I would have told you of good</LINE>
<LINE>wrestling, which you have lost the sight of.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You tell us the manner of the wrestling.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LE BEAU</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will tell you the beginning; and, if it please</LINE>
<LINE>your ladyships, you may see the end; for the best is</LINE>
<LINE>yet to do; and here, where you are, they are coming</LINE>
<LINE>to perform it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, the beginning, that is dead and buried.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LE BEAU</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There comes an old man and his three sons,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I could match this beginning with an old tale.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LE BEAU</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Three proper young men, of excellent growth and presence.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles, the</LINE>
<LINE>duke's wrestler; which Charles in a moment threw him</LINE>
<LINE>and broke three of his ribs, that there is little</LINE>
<LINE>hope of life in him: so he served the second, and</LINE>
<LINE>so the third. Yonder they lie; the poor old man,</LINE>
<LINE>their father, making such pitiful dole over them</LINE>
<LINE>that all the beholders take his part with weeping.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alas!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But what is the sport, monsieur, that the ladies</LINE>
<LINE>have lost?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LE BEAU</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, this that I speak of.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thus men may grow wiser every day: it is the first</LINE>
<LINE>time that ever I heard breaking of ribs was sport</LINE>
<LINE>for ladies.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Or I, I promise thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But is there any else longs to see this broken music</LINE>
<LINE>in his sides? is there yet another dotes upon</LINE>
<LINE>rib-breaking? Shall we see this wrestling, cousin?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LE BEAU</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You must, if you stay here; for here is the place</LINE>
<LINE>appointed for the wrestling, and they are ready to</LINE>
<LINE>perform it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yonder, sure, they are coming: let us now stay and see it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Flourish. Enter DUKE FREDERICK, Lords, ORLANDO,
CHARLES, and Attendants</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE FREDERICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come on: since the youth will not be entreated, his</LINE>
<LINE>own peril on his forwardness.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is yonder the man?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LE BEAU</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Even he, madam.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alas, he is too young! yet he looks successfully.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE FREDERICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How now, daughter and cousin! are you crept hither</LINE>
<LINE>to see the wrestling?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, my liege, so please you give us leave.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE FREDERICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You will take little delight in it, I can tell you;</LINE>
<LINE>there is such odds in the man. In pity of the</LINE>
<LINE>challenger's youth I would fain dissuade him, but he</LINE>
<LINE>will not be entreated. Speak to him, ladies; see if</LINE>
<LINE>you can move him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Call him hither, good Monsieur Le Beau.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE FREDERICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do so: I'll not be by.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LE BEAU</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Monsieur the challenger, the princesses call for you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I attend them with all respect and duty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Young man, have you challenged Charles the wrestler?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, fair princess; he is the general challenger: I</LINE>
<LINE>come but in, as others do, to try with him the</LINE>
<LINE>strength of my youth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Young gentleman, your spirits are too bold for your</LINE>
<LINE>years. You have seen cruel proof of this man's</LINE>
<LINE>strength: if you saw yourself with your eyes or</LINE>
<LINE>knew yourself with your judgment, the fear of your</LINE>
<LINE>adventure would counsel you to a more equal</LINE>
<LINE>enterprise. We pray you, for your own sake, to</LINE>
<LINE>embrace your own safety and give over this attempt.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do, young sir; your reputation shall not therefore</LINE>
<LINE>be misprised: we will make it our suit to the duke</LINE>
<LINE>that the wrestling might not go forward.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I beseech you, punish me not with your hard</LINE>
<LINE>thoughts; wherein I confess me much guilty, to deny</LINE>
<LINE>so fair and excellent ladies any thing. But let</LINE>
<LINE>your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my</LINE>
<LINE>trial: wherein if I be foiled, there is but one</LINE>
<LINE>shamed that was never gracious; if killed, but one</LINE>
<LINE>dead that was willing to be so: I shall do my</LINE>
<LINE>friends no wrong, for I have none to lament me, the</LINE>
<LINE>world no injury, for in it I have nothing; only in</LINE>
<LINE>the world I fill up a place, which may be better</LINE>
<LINE>supplied when I have made it empty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The little strength that I have, I would it were with you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And mine, to eke out hers.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fare you well: pray heaven I be deceived in you!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your heart's desires be with you!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, where is this young gallant that is so</LINE>
<LINE>desirous to lie with his mother earth?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ready, sir; but his will hath in it a more modest working.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE FREDERICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You shall try but one fall.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, I warrant your grace, you shall not entreat him</LINE>
<LINE>to a second, that have so mightily persuaded him</LINE>
<LINE>from a first.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>An you mean to mock me after, you should not have</LINE>
<LINE>mocked me before: but come your ways.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now Hercules be thy speed, young man!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would I were invisible, to catch the strong</LINE>
<LINE>fellow by the leg.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>They wrestle</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O excellent young man!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If I had a thunderbolt in mine eye, I can tell who</LINE>
<LINE>should down.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Shout. CHARLES is thrown</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE FREDERICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No more, no more.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, I beseech your grace: I am not yet well breathed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE FREDERICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How dost thou, Charles?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LE BEAU</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He cannot speak, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE FREDERICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Bear him away. What is thy name, young man?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Orlando, my liege; the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE FREDERICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would thou hadst been son to some man else:</LINE>
<LINE>The world esteem'd thy father honourable,</LINE>
<LINE>But I did find him still mine enemy:</LINE>
<LINE>Thou shouldst have better pleased me with this deed,</LINE>
<LINE>Hadst thou descended from another house.</LINE>
<LINE>But fare thee well; thou art a gallant youth:</LINE>
<LINE>I would thou hadst told me of another father.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt DUKE FREDERICK, train, and LE BEAU</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Were I my father, coz, would I do this?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am more proud to be Sir Rowland's son,</LINE>
<LINE>His youngest son; and would not change that calling,</LINE>
<LINE>To be adopted heir to Frederick.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My father loved Sir Rowland as his soul,</LINE>
<LINE>And all the world was of my father's mind:</LINE>
<LINE>Had I before known this young man his son,</LINE>
<LINE>I should have given him tears unto entreaties,</LINE>
<LINE>Ere he should thus have ventured.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Gentle cousin,</LINE>
<LINE>Let us go thank him and encourage him:</LINE>
<LINE>My father's rough and envious disposition</LINE>
<LINE>Sticks me at heart. Sir, you have well deserved:</LINE>
<LINE>If you do keep your promises in love</LINE>
<LINE>But justly, as you have exceeded all promise,</LINE>
<LINE>Your mistress shall be happy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Gentleman,</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Giving him a chain from her neck</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Wear this for me, one out of suits with fortune,</LINE>
<LINE>That could give more, but that her hand lacks means.</LINE>
<LINE>Shall we go, coz?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay. Fare you well, fair gentleman.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Can I not say, I thank you? My better parts</LINE>
<LINE>Are all thrown down, and that which here stands up</LINE>
<LINE>Is but a quintain, a mere lifeless block.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He calls us back: my pride fell with my fortunes;</LINE>
<LINE>I'll ask him what he would. Did you call, sir?</LINE>
<LINE>Sir, you have wrestled well and overthrown</LINE>
<LINE>More than your enemies.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Will you go, coz?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Have with you. Fare you well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt ROSALIND and CELIA</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What passion hangs these weights upon my tongue?</LINE>
<LINE>I cannot speak to her, yet she urged conference.</LINE>
<LINE>O poor Orlando, thou art overthrown!</LINE>
<LINE>Or Charles or something weaker masters thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Re-enter LE BEAU</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LE BEAU</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good sir, I do in friendship counsel you</LINE>
<LINE>To leave this place. Albeit you have deserved</LINE>
<LINE>High commendation, true applause and love,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet such is now the duke's condition</LINE>
<LINE>That he misconstrues all that you have done.</LINE>
<LINE>The duke is humorous; what he is indeed,</LINE>
<LINE>More suits you to conceive than I to speak of.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I thank you, sir: and, pray you, tell me this:</LINE>
<LINE>Which of the two was daughter of the duke</LINE>
<LINE>That here was at the wrestling?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LE BEAU</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Neither his daughter, if we judge by manners;</LINE>
<LINE>But yet indeed the lesser is his daughter</LINE>
<LINE>The other is daughter to the banish'd duke,</LINE>
<LINE>And here detain'd by her usurping uncle,</LINE>
<LINE>To keep his daughter company; whose loves</LINE>
<LINE>Are dearer than the natural bond of sisters.</LINE>
<LINE>But I can tell you that of late this duke</LINE>
<LINE>Hath ta'en displeasure 'gainst his gentle niece,</LINE>
<LINE>Grounded upon no other argument</LINE>
<LINE>But that the people praise her for her virtues</LINE>
<LINE>And pity her for her good father's sake;</LINE>
<LINE>And, on my life, his malice 'gainst the lady</LINE>
<LINE>Will suddenly break forth. Sir, fare you well:</LINE>
<LINE>Hereafter, in a better world than this,</LINE>
<LINE>I shall desire more love and knowledge of you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I rest much bounden to you: fare you well.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit LE BEAU</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Thus must I from the smoke into the smother;</LINE>
<LINE>From tyrant duke unto a tyrant brother:</LINE>
<LINE>But heavenly Rosalind!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>
</SCENE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE III.  A room in the palace.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter CELIA and ROSALIND</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, cousin! why, Rosalind! Cupid have mercy! not a word?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not one to throw at a dog.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, thy words are too precious to be cast away upon</LINE>
<LINE>curs; throw some of them at me; come, lame me with reasons.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then there were two cousins laid up; when the one</LINE>
<LINE>should be lamed with reasons and the other mad</LINE>
<LINE>without any.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But is all this for your father?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, some of it is for my child's father. O, how</LINE>
<LINE>full of briers is this working-day world!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They are but burs, cousin, thrown upon thee in</LINE>
<LINE>holiday foolery: if we walk not in the trodden</LINE>
<LINE>paths our very petticoats will catch them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I could shake them off my coat: these burs are in my heart.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hem them away.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would try, if I could cry 'hem' and have him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, come, wrestle with thy affections.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, they take the part of a better wrestler than myself!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, a good wish upon you! you will try in time, in</LINE>
<LINE>despite of a fall. But, turning these jests out of</LINE>
<LINE>service, let us talk in good earnest: is it</LINE>
<LINE>possible, on such a sudden, you should fall into so</LINE>
<LINE>strong a liking with old Sir Rowland's youngest son?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The duke my father loved his father dearly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son</LINE>
<LINE>dearly? By this kind of chase, I should hate him,</LINE>
<LINE>for my father hated his father dearly; yet I hate</LINE>
<LINE>not Orlando.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, faith, hate him not, for my sake.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why should I not? doth he not deserve well?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let me love him for that, and do you love him</LINE>
<LINE>because I do. Look, here comes the duke.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With his eyes full of anger.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter DUKE FREDERICK, with Lords</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE FREDERICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Mistress, dispatch you with your safest haste</LINE>
<LINE>And get you from our court.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Me, uncle?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE FREDERICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You, cousin</LINE>
<LINE>Within these ten days if that thou be'st found</LINE>
<LINE>So near our public court as twenty miles,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou diest for it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do beseech your grace,</LINE>
<LINE>Let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me:</LINE>
<LINE>If with myself I hold intelligence</LINE>
<LINE>Or have acquaintance with mine own desires,</LINE>
<LINE>If that I do not dream or be not frantic,--</LINE>
<LINE>As I do trust I am not--then, dear uncle,</LINE>
<LINE>Never so much as in a thought unborn</LINE>
<LINE>Did I offend your highness.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE FREDERICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thus do all traitors:</LINE>
<LINE>If their purgation did consist in words,</LINE>
<LINE>They are as innocent as grace itself:</LINE>
<LINE>Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor:</LINE>
<LINE>Tell me whereon the likelihood depends.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE FREDERICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou art thy father's daughter; there's enough.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So was I when your highness took his dukedom;</LINE>
<LINE>So was I when your highness banish'd him:</LINE>
<LINE>Treason is not inherited, my lord;</LINE>
<LINE>Or, if we did derive it from our friends,</LINE>
<LINE>What's that to me? my father was no traitor:</LINE>
<LINE>Then, good my liege, mistake me not so much</LINE>
<LINE>To think my poverty is treacherous.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Dear sovereign, hear me speak.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE FREDERICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, Celia; we stay'd her for your sake,</LINE>
<LINE>Else had she with her father ranged along.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I did not then entreat to have her stay;</LINE>
<LINE>It was your pleasure and your own remorse:</LINE>
<LINE>I was too young that time to value her;</LINE>
<LINE>But now I know her: if she be a traitor,</LINE>
<LINE>Why so am I; we still have slept together,</LINE>
<LINE>Rose at an instant, learn'd, play'd, eat together,</LINE>
<LINE>And wheresoever we went, like Juno's swans,</LINE>
<LINE>Still we went coupled and inseparable.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE FREDERICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She is too subtle for thee; and her smoothness,</LINE>
<LINE>Her very silence and her patience</LINE>
<LINE>Speak to the people, and they pity her.</LINE>
<LINE>Thou art a fool: she robs thee of thy name;</LINE>
<LINE>And thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous</LINE>
<LINE>When she is gone. Then open not thy lips:</LINE>
<LINE>Firm and irrevocable is my doom</LINE>
<LINE>Which I have pass'd upon her; she is banish'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pronounce that sentence then on me, my liege:</LINE>
<LINE>I cannot live out of her company.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE FREDERICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You are a fool. You, niece, provide yourself:</LINE>
<LINE>If you outstay the time, upon mine honour,</LINE>
<LINE>And in the greatness of my word, you die.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt DUKE FREDERICK and Lords</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O my poor Rosalind, whither wilt thou go?</LINE>
<LINE>Wilt thou change fathers? I will give thee mine.</LINE>
<LINE>I charge thee, be not thou more grieved than I am.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have more cause.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou hast not, cousin;</LINE>
<LINE>Prithee be cheerful: know'st thou not, the duke</LINE>
<LINE>Hath banish'd me, his daughter?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That he hath not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, hath not? Rosalind lacks then the love</LINE>
<LINE>Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one:</LINE>
<LINE>Shall we be sunder'd? shall we part, sweet girl?</LINE>
<LINE>No: let my father seek another heir.</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore devise with me how we may fly,</LINE>
<LINE>Whither to go and what to bear with us;</LINE>
<LINE>And do not seek to take your change upon you,</LINE>
<LINE>To bear your griefs yourself and leave me out;</LINE>
<LINE>For, by this heaven, now at our sorrows pale,</LINE>
<LINE>Say what thou canst, I'll go along with thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, whither shall we go?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To seek my uncle in the forest of Arden.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alas, what danger will it be to us,</LINE>
<LINE>Maids as we are, to travel forth so far!</LINE>
<LINE>Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll put myself in poor and mean attire</LINE>
<LINE>And with a kind of umber smirch my face;</LINE>
<LINE>The like do you: so shall we pass along</LINE>
<LINE>And never stir assailants.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Were it not better,</LINE>
<LINE>Because that I am more than common tall,</LINE>
<LINE>That I did suit me all points like a man?</LINE>
<LINE>A gallant curtle-axe upon my thigh,</LINE>
<LINE>A boar-spear in my hand; and--in my heart</LINE>
<LINE>Lie there what hidden woman's fear there will--</LINE>
<LINE>We'll have a swashing and a martial outside,</LINE>
<LINE>As many other mannish cowards have</LINE>
<LINE>That do outface it with their semblances.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What shall I call thee when thou art a man?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll have no worse a name than Jove's own page;</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore look you call me Ganymede.</LINE>
<LINE>But what will you be call'd?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Something that hath a reference to my state</LINE>
<LINE>No longer Celia, but Aliena.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But, cousin, what if we assay'd to steal</LINE>
<LINE>The clownish fool out of your father's court?</LINE>
<LINE>Would he not be a comfort to our travel?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He'll go along o'er the wide world with me;</LINE>
<LINE>Leave me alone to woo him. Let's away,</LINE>
<LINE>And get our jewels and our wealth together,</LINE>
<LINE>Devise the fittest time and safest way</LINE>
<LINE>To hide us from pursuit that will be made</LINE>
<LINE>After my flight. Now go we in content</LINE>

<LINE>More free from peril than the envious court?</LINE>
<LINE>Here feel we but the penalty of Adam,</LINE>
<LINE>The seasons' difference, as the icy fang</LINE>
<LINE>And churlish chiding of the winter's wind,</LINE>
<LINE>Which, when it bites and blows upon my body,</LINE>
<LINE>Even till I shrink with cold, I smile and say</LINE>
<LINE>'This is no flattery: these are counsellors</LINE>
<LINE>That feelingly persuade me what I am.'</LINE>
<LINE>Sweet are the uses of adversity,</LINE>
<LINE>Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,</LINE>
<LINE>Wears yet a precious jewel in his head;</LINE>
<LINE>And this our life exempt from public haunt</LINE>
<LINE>Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,</LINE>
<LINE>Sermons in stones and good in every thing.</LINE>
<LINE>I would not change it.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE SENIOR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, shall we go and kill us venison?</LINE>
<LINE>And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools,</LINE>
<LINE>Being native burghers of this desert city,</LINE>
<LINE>Should in their own confines with forked heads</LINE>
<LINE>Have their round haunches gored.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Indeed, my lord,</LINE>
<LINE>The melancholy Jaques grieves at that,</LINE>
<LINE>And, in that kind, swears you do more usurp</LINE>
<LINE>Than doth your brother that hath banish'd you.</LINE>
<LINE>To-day my Lord of Amiens and myself</LINE>
<LINE>Did steal behind him as he lay along</LINE>
<LINE>Under an oak whose antique root peeps out</LINE>
<LINE>Upon the brook that brawls along this wood:</LINE>
<LINE>To the which place a poor sequester'd stag,</LINE>
<LINE>That from the hunter's aim had ta'en a hurt,</LINE>
<LINE>Did come to languish, and indeed, my lord,</LINE>
<LINE>The wretched animal heaved forth such groans</LINE>
<LINE>That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat</LINE>
<LINE>Almost to bursting, and the big round tears</LINE>
<LINE>Coursed one another down his innocent nose</LINE>
<LINE>In piteous chase; and thus the hairy fool</LINE>
<LINE>Much marked of the melancholy Jaques,</LINE>
<LINE>Stood on the extremest verge of the swift brook,</LINE>
<LINE>Augmenting it with tears.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE SENIOR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But what said Jaques?</LINE>
<LINE>Did he not moralize this spectacle?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, yes, into a thousand similes.</LINE>
<LINE>First, for his weeping into the needless stream;</LINE>
<LINE>'Poor deer,' quoth he, 'thou makest a testament</LINE>
<LINE>As worldlings do, giving thy sum of more</LINE>
<LINE>To that which had too much:' then, being there alone,</LINE>
<LINE>Left and abandon'd of his velvet friends,</LINE>
<LINE>''Tis right:' quoth he; 'thus misery doth part</LINE>
<LINE>The flux of company:' anon a careless herd,</LINE>
<LINE>Full of the pasture, jumps along by him</LINE>
<LINE>And never stays to greet him; 'Ay' quoth Jaques,</LINE>
<LINE>'Sweep on, you fat and greasy citizens;</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis just the fashion: wherefore do you look</LINE>
<LINE>Upon that poor and broken bankrupt there?'</LINE>
<LINE>Thus most invectively he pierceth through</LINE>
<LINE>The body of the country, city, court,</LINE>
<LINE>Yea, and of this our life, swearing that we</LINE>
<LINE>Are mere usurpers, tyrants and what's worse,</LINE>
<LINE>To fright the animals and to kill them up</LINE>
<LINE>In their assign'd and native dwelling-place.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE SENIOR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And did you leave him in this contemplation?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We did, my lord, weeping and commenting</LINE>
<LINE>Upon the sobbing deer.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE SENIOR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Show me the place:</LINE>
<LINE>I love to cope him in these sullen fits,</LINE>

<LINE>I cannot hear of any that did see her.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, my young master? O, my gentle master!</LINE>
<LINE>O my sweet master! O you memory</LINE>
<LINE>Of old Sir Rowland! why, what make you here?</LINE>
<LINE>Why are you virtuous? why do people love you?</LINE>
<LINE>And wherefore are you gentle, strong and valiant?</LINE>
<LINE>Why would you be so fond to overcome</LINE>
<LINE>The bonny priser of the humorous duke?</LINE>
<LINE>Your praise is come too swiftly home before you.</LINE>
<LINE>Know you not, master, to some kind of men</LINE>
<LINE>Their graces serve them but as enemies?</LINE>
<LINE>No more do yours: your virtues, gentle master,</LINE>
<LINE>Are sanctified and holy traitors to you.</LINE>
<LINE>O, what a world is this, when what is comely</LINE>
<LINE>Envenoms him that bears it!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, what's the matter?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O unhappy youth!</LINE>
<LINE>Come not within these doors; within this roof</LINE>
<LINE>The enemy of all your graces lives:</LINE>
<LINE>Your brother--no, no brother; yet the son--</LINE>
<LINE>Yet not the son, I will not call him son</LINE>
<LINE>Of him I was about to call his father--</LINE>
<LINE>Hath heard your praises, and this night he means</LINE>
<LINE>To burn the lodging where you use to lie</LINE>
<LINE>And you within it: if he fail of that,</LINE>
<LINE>He will have other means to cut you off.</LINE>
<LINE>I overheard him and his practises.</LINE>
<LINE>This is no place; this house is but a butchery:</LINE>
<LINE>Abhor it, fear it, do not enter it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, whither, Adam, wouldst thou have me go?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No matter whither, so you come not here.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, wouldst thou have me go and beg my food?</LINE>
<LINE>Or with a base and boisterous sword enforce</LINE>
<LINE>A thievish living on the common road?</LINE>
<LINE>This I must do, or know not what to do:</LINE>
<LINE>Yet this I will not do, do how I can;</LINE>
<LINE>I rather will subject me to the malice</LINE>
<LINE>Of a diverted blood and bloody brother.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But do not so. I have five hundred crowns,</LINE>
<LINE>The thrifty hire I saved under your father,</LINE>
<LINE>Which I did store to be my foster-nurse</LINE>
<LINE>When service should in my old limbs lie lame</LINE>
<LINE>And unregarded age in corners thrown:</LINE>
<LINE>Take that, and He that doth the ravens feed,</LINE>
<LINE>Yea, providently caters for the sparrow,</LINE>
<LINE>Be comfort to my age! Here is the gold;</LINE>
<LINE>And all this I give you. Let me be your servant:</LINE>
<LINE>Though I look old, yet I am strong and lusty;</LINE>
<LINE>For in my youth I never did apply</LINE>
<LINE>Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo</LINE>
<LINE>The means of weakness and debility;</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore my age is as a lusty winter,</LINE>
<LINE>Frosty, but kindly: let me go with you;</LINE>
<LINE>I'll do the service of a younger man</LINE>
<LINE>In all your business and necessities.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O good old man, how well in thee appears</LINE>
<LINE>The constant service of the antique world,</LINE>
<LINE>When service sweat for duty, not for meed!</LINE>
<LINE>Thou art not for the fashion of these times,</LINE>
<LINE>Where none will sweat but for promotion,</LINE>
<LINE>And having that, do choke their service up</LINE>
<LINE>Even with the having: it is not so with thee.</LINE>
<LINE>But, poor old man, thou prunest a rotten tree,</LINE>
<LINE>That cannot so much as a blossom yield</LINE>
<LINE>In lieu of all thy pains and husbandry</LINE>
<LINE>But come thy ways; well go along together,</LINE>
<LINE>And ere we have thy youthful wages spent,</LINE>
<LINE>We'll light upon some settled low content.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Master, go on, and I will follow thee,</LINE>
<LINE>To the last gasp, with truth and loyalty.</LINE>
<LINE>From seventeen years till now almost fourscore</LINE>
<LINE>Here lived I, but now live here no more.</LINE>
<LINE>At seventeen years many their fortunes seek;</LINE>
<LINE>But at fourscore it is too late a week:</LINE>
<LINE>Yet fortune cannot recompense me better</LINE>
<LINE>Than to die well and not my master's debtor.</LINE>

<LINE>I care not for my spirits, if my legs were not weary.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I could find in my heart to disgrace my man's</LINE>

<LINE>good Aliena!</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I pray you, bear with me; I cannot go no further.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For my part, I had rather bear with you than bear</LINE>
<LINE>you; yet I should bear no cross if I did bear you,</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, this is the forest of Arden.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SILVIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, Corin, being old, thou canst not guess,</LINE>
<LINE>Though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover</LINE>
<LINE>As ever sigh'd upon a midnight pillow:</LINE>
<LINE>But if thy love were ever like to mine--</LINE>
<LINE>As sure I think did never man love so--</LINE>
<LINE>How many actions most ridiculous</LINE>
<LINE>Hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy?</LINE>

<LINE>O, thou didst then ne'er love so heartily!</LINE>
<LINE>If thou remember'st not the slightest folly</LINE>
<LINE>That ever love did make thee run into,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou hast not loved:</LINE>
<LINE>Or if thou hast not sat as I do now,</LINE>
<LINE>Wearying thy hearer in thy mistress' praise,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou hast not loved:</LINE>
<LINE>Or if thou hast not broke from company</LINE>
<LINE>Abruptly, as my passion now makes me,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou hast not loved.</LINE>

<LINE>Alas, poor shepherd! searching of thy wound,</LINE>
<LINE>I have by hard adventure found mine own.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And I mine. I remember, when I was in love I broke</LINE>
<LINE>my sword upon a stone and bid him take that for</LINE>
<LINE>coming a-night to Jane Smile; and I remember the</LINE>
<LINE>kissing of her batlet and the cow's dugs that her</LINE>
<LINE>pretty chopt hands had milked; and I remember the</LINE>
<LINE>wooing of a peascod instead of her, from whom I took</LINE>
<LINE>two cods and, giving her them again, said with</LINE>
<LINE>weeping tears 'Wear these for my sake.' We that are</LINE>
<LINE>true lovers run into strange capers; but as all is</LINE>
<LINE>mortal in nature, so is all nature in love mortal in folly.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>CORIN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fair sir, I pity her</LINE>
<LINE>And wish, for her sake more than for mine own,</LINE>
<LINE>My fortunes were more able to relieve her;</LINE>
<LINE>But I am shepherd to another man</LINE>
<LINE>And do not shear the fleeces that I graze:</LINE>
<LINE>My master is of churlish disposition</LINE>
<LINE>And little recks to find the way to heaven</LINE>
<LINE>By doing deeds of hospitality:</LINE>
<LINE>Besides, his cote, his flocks and bounds of feed</LINE>
<LINE>Are now on sale, and at our sheepcote now,</LINE>
<LINE>By reason of his absence, there is nothing</LINE>
<LINE>That you will feed on; but what is, come see.</LINE>
<LINE>And in my voice most welcome shall you be.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>A table set out. Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, and
Lords like outlaws</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE SENIOR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I think he be transform'd into a beast;</LINE>
<LINE>For I can no where find him like a man.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, he is but even now gone hence:</LINE>
<LINE>Here was he merry, hearing of a song.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE SENIOR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If he, compact of jars, grow musical,</LINE>
<LINE>We shall have shortly discord in the spheres.</LINE>
<LINE>Go, seek him: tell him I would speak with him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter JAQUES</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He saves my labour by his own approach.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE SENIOR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, how now, monsieur! what a life is this,</LINE>
<LINE>That your poor friends must woo your company?</LINE>
<LINE>What, you look merrily!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A fool, a fool! I met a fool i' the forest,</LINE>
<LINE>A motley fool; a miserable world!</LINE>
<LINE>As I do live by food, I met a fool</LINE>
<LINE>Who laid him down and bask'd him in the sun,</LINE>
<LINE>And rail'd on Lady Fortune in good terms,</LINE>
<LINE>In good set terms and yet a motley fool.</LINE>
<LINE>'Good morrow, fool,' quoth I. 'No, sir,' quoth he,</LINE>
<LINE>'Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune:'</LINE>
<LINE>And then he drew a dial from his poke,</LINE>
<LINE>And, looking on it with lack-lustre eye,</LINE>
<LINE>Says very wisely, 'It is ten o'clock:</LINE>
<LINE>Thus we may see,' quoth he, 'how the world wags:</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis but an hour ago since it was nine,</LINE>
<LINE>And after one hour more 'twill be eleven;</LINE>
<LINE>And so, from hour to hour, we ripe and ripe,</LINE>
<LINE>And then, from hour to hour, we rot and rot;</LINE>
<LINE>And thereby hangs a tale.' When I did hear</LINE>
<LINE>The motley fool thus moral on the time,</LINE>
<LINE>My lungs began to crow like chanticleer,</LINE>
<LINE>That fools should be so deep-contemplative,</LINE>
<LINE>And I did laugh sans intermission</LINE>
<LINE>An hour by his dial. O noble fool!</LINE>
<LINE>A worthy fool! Motley's the only wear.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE SENIOR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What fool is this?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O worthy fool! One that hath been a courtier,</LINE>
<LINE>And says, if ladies be but young and fair,</LINE>
<LINE>They have the gift to know it: and in his brain,</LINE>
<LINE>Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit</LINE>
<LINE>After a voyage, he hath strange places cramm'd</LINE>
<LINE>With observation, the which he vents</LINE>
<LINE>In mangled forms. O that I were a fool!</LINE>
<LINE>I am ambitious for a motley coat.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE SENIOR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou shalt have one.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is my only suit;</LINE>
<LINE>Provided that you weed your better judgments</LINE>
<LINE>Of all opinion that grows rank in them</LINE>
<LINE>That I am wise. I must have liberty</LINE>
<LINE>Withal, as large a charter as the wind,</LINE>
<LINE>To blow on whom I please; for so fools have;</LINE>
<LINE>And they that are most galled with my folly,</LINE>
<LINE>They most must laugh. And why, sir, must they so?</LINE>
<LINE>The 'why' is plain as way to parish church:</LINE>
<LINE>He that a fool doth very wisely hit</LINE>
<LINE>Doth very foolishly, although he smart,</LINE>
<LINE>Not to seem senseless of the bob: if not,</LINE>
<LINE>The wise man's folly is anatomized</LINE>
<LINE>Even by the squandering glances of the fool.</LINE>
<LINE>Invest me in my motley; give me leave</LINE>
<LINE>To speak my mind, and I will through and through</LINE>
<LINE>Cleanse the foul body of the infected world,</LINE>
<LINE>If they will patiently receive my medicine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE SENIOR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fie on thee! I can tell what thou wouldst do.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, for a counter, would I do but good?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE SENIOR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Most mischievous foul sin, in chiding sin:</LINE>
<LINE>For thou thyself hast been a libertine,</LINE>
<LINE>As sensual as the brutish sting itself;</LINE>
<LINE>And all the embossed sores and headed evils,</LINE>
<LINE>That thou with licence of free foot hast caught,</LINE>
<LINE>Wouldst thou disgorge into the general world.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, who cries out on pride,</LINE>
<LINE>That can therein tax any private party?</LINE>
<LINE>Doth it not flow as hugely as the sea,</LINE>
<LINE>Till that the weary very means do ebb?</LINE>
<LINE>What woman in the city do I name,</LINE>
<LINE>When that I say the city-woman bears</LINE>
<LINE>The cost of princes on unworthy shoulders?</LINE>
<LINE>Who can come in and say that I mean her,</LINE>
<LINE>When such a one as she such is her neighbour?</LINE>
<LINE>Or what is he of basest function</LINE>
<LINE>That says his bravery is not of my cost,</LINE>
<LINE>Thinking that I mean him, but therein suits</LINE>
<LINE>His folly to the mettle of my speech?</LINE>
<LINE>There then; how then? what then? Let me see wherein</LINE>
<LINE>My tongue hath wrong'd him: if it do him right,</LINE>
<LINE>Then he hath wrong'd himself; if he be free,</LINE>
<LINE>Why then my taxing like a wild-goose flies,</LINE>
<LINE>Unclaim'd of any man. But who comes here?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter ORLANDO, with his sword drawn</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Forbear, and eat no more.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, I have eat none yet.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nor shalt not, till necessity be served.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Of what kind should this cock come of?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE SENIOR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Art thou thus bolden'd, man, by thy distress,</LINE>
<LINE>Or else a rude despiser of good manners,</LINE>
<LINE>That in civility thou seem'st so empty?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You touch'd my vein at first: the thorny point</LINE>
<LINE>Of bare distress hath ta'en from me the show</LINE>
<LINE>Of smooth civility: yet am I inland bred</LINE>
<LINE>And know some nurture. But forbear, I say:</LINE>
<LINE>He dies that touches any of this fruit</LINE>
<LINE>Till I and my affairs are answered.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>An you will not be answered with reason, I must die.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE SENIOR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What would you have? Your gentleness shall force</LINE>
<LINE>More than your force move us to gentleness.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I almost die for food; and let me have it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE SENIOR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sit down and feed, and welcome to our table.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Speak you so gently? Pardon me, I pray you:</LINE>
<LINE>I thought that all things had been savage here;</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore put I on the countenance</LINE>
<LINE>Of stern commandment. But whate'er you are</LINE>
<LINE>That in this desert inaccessible,</LINE>
<LINE>Under the shade of melancholy boughs,</LINE>
<LINE>Lose and neglect the creeping hours of time</LINE>
<LINE>If ever you have look'd on better days,</LINE>
<LINE>If ever been where bells have knoll'd to church,</LINE>
<LINE>If ever sat at any good man's feast,</LINE>
<LINE>If ever from your eyelids wiped a tear</LINE>
<LINE>And know what 'tis to pity and be pitied,</LINE>
<LINE>Let gentleness my strong enforcement be:</LINE>
<LINE>In the which hope I blush, and hide my sword.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE SENIOR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>True is it that we have seen better days,</LINE>
<LINE>And have with holy bell been knoll'd to church</LINE>
<LINE>And sat at good men's feasts and wiped our eyes</LINE>
<LINE>Of drops that sacred pity hath engender'd:</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore sit you down in gentleness</LINE>
<LINE>And take upon command what help we have</LINE>
<LINE>That to your wanting may be minister'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then but forbear your food a little while,</LINE>
<LINE>Whiles, like a doe, I go to find my fawn</LINE>
<LINE>And give it food. There is an old poor man,</LINE>
<LINE>Who after me hath many a weary step</LINE>
<LINE>Limp'd in pure love: till he be first sufficed,</LINE>
<LINE>Oppress'd with two weak evils, age and hunger,</LINE>
<LINE>I will not touch a bit.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE SENIOR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go find him out,</LINE>
<LINE>And we will nothing waste till you return.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I thank ye; and be blest for your good comfort!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE SENIOR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy:</LINE>
<LINE>This wide and universal theatre</LINE>
<LINE>Presents more woeful pageants than the scene</LINE>
<LINE>Wherein we play in.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>All the world's a stage,</LINE>
<LINE>And all the men and women merely players:</LINE>
<LINE>They have their exits and their entrances;</LINE>
<LINE>And one man in his time plays many parts,</LINE>
<LINE>His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,</LINE>
<LINE>Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.</LINE>
<LINE>And then the whining school-boy, with his satchel</LINE>
<LINE>And shining morning face, creeping like snail</LINE>
<LINE>Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,</LINE>
<LINE>Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad</LINE>
<LINE>Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,</LINE>
<LINE>Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,</LINE>
<LINE>Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,</LINE>
<LINE>Seeking the bubble reputation</LINE>
<LINE>Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,</LINE>
<LINE>In fair round belly with good capon lined,</LINE>
<LINE>With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,</LINE>
<LINE>Full of wise saws and modern instances;</LINE>
<LINE>And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts</LINE>
<LINE>Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,</LINE>
<LINE>With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,</LINE>
<LINE>His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide</LINE>
<LINE>For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,</LINE>
<LINE>Turning again toward childish treble, pipes</LINE>
<LINE>And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,</LINE>
<LINE>That ends this strange eventful history,</LINE>
<LINE>Is second childishness and mere oblivion,</LINE>
<LINE>Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Re-enter ORLANDO, with ADAM</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE SENIOR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Welcome. Set down your venerable burthen,</LINE>
<LINE>And let him feed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I thank you most for him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So had you need:</LINE>
<LINE>I scarce can speak to thank you for myself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE SENIOR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Welcome; fall to: I will not trouble you</LINE>
<LINE>As yet, to question you about your fortunes.</LINE>
<LINE>Give us some music; and, good cousin, sing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SUBHEAD>SONG.</SUBHEAD>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AMIENS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Blow, blow, thou winter wind.</LINE>
<LINE>Thou art not so unkind</LINE>
<LINE>As man's ingratitude;</LINE>
<LINE>Thy tooth is not so keen,</LINE>
<LINE>Because thou art not seen,</LINE>
<LINE>Although thy breath be rude.</LINE>
<LINE>Heigh-ho! sing, heigh-ho! unto the green holly:</LINE>
<LINE>Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly:</LINE>
<LINE>Then, heigh-ho, the holly!</LINE>
<LINE>This life is most jolly.</LINE>
<LINE>Freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky,</LINE>
<LINE>That dost not bite so nigh</LINE>
<LINE>As benefits forgot:</LINE>
<LINE>Though thou the waters warp,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy sting is not so sharp</LINE>
<LINE>As friend remember'd not.</LINE>
<LINE>Heigh-ho! sing, &amp;c.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE SENIOR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If that you were the good Sir Rowland's son,</LINE>
<LINE>As you have whisper'd faithfully you were,</LINE>
<LINE>And as mine eye doth his effigies witness</LINE>
<LINE>Most truly limn'd and living in your face,</LINE>
<LINE>Be truly welcome hither: I am the duke</LINE>
<LINE>That loved your father: the residue of your fortune,</LINE>
<LINE>Go to my cave and tell me. Good old man,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou art right welcome as thy master is.</LINE>
<LINE>Support him by the arm. Give me your hand,</LINE>
<LINE>And let me all your fortunes understand.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter DUKE FREDERICK, Lords, and OLIVER</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE FREDERICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not see him since? Sir, sir, that cannot be:</LINE>
<LINE>But were I not the better part made mercy,</LINE>
<LINE>I should not seek an absent argument</LINE>
<LINE>Of my revenge, thou present. But look to it:</LINE>
<LINE>Find out thy brother, wheresoe'er he is;</LINE>
<LINE>Seek him with candle; bring him dead or living</LINE>
<LINE>Within this twelvemonth, or turn thou no more</LINE>
<LINE>To seek a living in our territory.</LINE>
<LINE>Thy lands and all things that thou dost call thine</LINE>
<LINE>Worth seizure do we seize into our hands,</LINE>
<LINE>Till thou canst quit thee by thy brothers mouth</LINE>
<LINE>Of what we think against thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLIVER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O that your highness knew my heart in this!</LINE>
<LINE>I never loved my brother in my life.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE FREDERICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>More villain thou. Well, push him out of doors;</LINE>
<LINE>And let my officers of such a nature</LINE>
<LINE>Make an extent upon his house and lands:</LINE>
<LINE>Do this expediently and turn him going.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt</STAGEDIR>
</SCENE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE II.  The forest.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter ORLANDO, with a paper</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hang there, my verse, in witness of my love:</LINE>
<LINE>And thou, thrice-crowned queen of night, survey</LINE>
<LINE>With thy chaste eye, from thy pale sphere above,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy huntress' name that my full life doth sway.</LINE>
<LINE>O Rosalind! these trees shall be my books</LINE>
<LINE>And in their barks my thoughts I'll character;</LINE>
<LINE>That every eye which in this forest looks</LINE>
<LINE>Shall see thy virtue witness'd every where.</LINE>
<LINE>Run, run, Orlando; carve on every tree</LINE>
<LINE>The fair, the chaste and unexpressive she.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>Enter CORIN and TOUCHSTONE</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And how like you this shepherd's life, Master Touchstone?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Truly, shepherd, in respect of itself, it is a good</LINE>
<LINE>life, but in respect that it is a shepherd's life,</LINE>
<LINE>it is naught. In respect that it is solitary, I</LINE>
<LINE>like it very well; but in respect that it is</LINE>
<LINE>private, it is a very vile life. Now, in respect it</LINE>
<LINE>is in the fields, it pleaseth me well; but in</LINE>
<LINE>respect it is not in the court, it is tedious. As</LINE>
<LINE>is it a spare life, look you, it fits my humour well;</LINE>
<LINE>but as there is no more plenty in it, it goes much</LINE>
<LINE>against my stomach. Hast any philosophy in thee, shepherd?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No more but that I know the more one sickens the</LINE>
<LINE>worse at ease he is; and that he that wants money,</LINE>
<LINE>means and content is without three good friends;</LINE>
<LINE>that the property of rain is to wet and fire to</LINE>
<LINE>burn; that good pasture makes fat sheep, and that a</LINE>
<LINE>great cause of the night is lack of the sun; that</LINE>
<LINE>he that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may</LINE>
<LINE>complain of good breeding or comes of a very dull kindred.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Such a one is a natural philosopher. Wast ever in</LINE>
<LINE>court, shepherd?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, truly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then thou art damned.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, I hope.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Truly, thou art damned like an ill-roasted egg, all</LINE>
<LINE>on one side.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For not being at court? Your reason.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, if thou never wast at court, thou never sawest</LINE>
<LINE>good manners; if thou never sawest good manners,</LINE>
<LINE>then thy manners must be wicked; and wickedness is</LINE>
<LINE>sin, and sin is damnation. Thou art in a parlous</LINE>
<LINE>state, shepherd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not a whit, Touchstone: those that are good manners</LINE>
<LINE>at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the</LINE>
<LINE>behavior of the country is most mockable at the</LINE>
<LINE>court. You told me you salute not at the court, but</LINE>
<LINE>you kiss your hands: that courtesy would be</LINE>
<LINE>uncleanly, if courtiers were shepherds.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Instance, briefly; come, instance.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, we are still handling our ewes, and their</LINE>
<LINE>fells, you know, are greasy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, do not your courtier's hands sweat? and is not</LINE>
<LINE>the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of</LINE>
<LINE>a man? Shallow, shallow. A better instance, I say; come.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Besides, our hands are hard.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your lips will feel them the sooner. Shallow again.</LINE>
<LINE>A more sounder instance, come.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And they are often tarred over with the surgery of</LINE>
<LINE>our sheep: and would you have us kiss tar? The</LINE>
<LINE>courtier's hands are perfumed with civet.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Most shallow man! thou worms-meat, in respect of a</LINE>
<LINE>good piece of flesh indeed! Learn of the wise, and</LINE>
<LINE>perpend: civet is of a baser birth than tar, the</LINE>
<LINE>very uncleanly flux of a cat. Mend the instance, shepherd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You have too courtly a wit for me: I'll rest.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Wilt thou rest damned? God help thee, shallow man!</LINE>
<LINE>God make incision in thee! thou art raw.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, I am a true labourer: I earn that I eat, get</LINE>
<LINE>that I wear, owe no man hate, envy no man's</LINE>
<LINE>happiness, glad of other men's good, content with my</LINE>
<LINE>harm, and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes</LINE>
<LINE>graze and my lambs suck.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That is another simple sin in you, to bring the ewes</LINE>
<LINE>and the rams together and to offer to get your</LINE>
<LINE>living by the copulation of cattle; to be bawd to a</LINE>
<LINE>bell-wether, and to betray a she-lamb of a</LINE>
<LINE>twelvemonth to a crooked-pated, old, cuckoldly ram,</LINE>
<LINE>out of all reasonable match. If thou beest not</LINE>
<LINE>damned for this, the devil himself will have no</LINE>
<LINE>shepherds; I cannot see else how thou shouldst</LINE>
<LINE>'scape.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here comes young Master Ganymede, my new mistress's brother.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter ROSALIND, with a paper, reading</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>From the east to western Ind,</LINE>
<LINE>No jewel is like Rosalind.</LINE>
<LINE>Her worth, being mounted on the wind,</LINE>
<LINE>Through all the world bears Rosalind.</LINE>
<LINE>All the pictures fairest lined</LINE>
<LINE>Are but black to Rosalind.</LINE>
<LINE>Let no fair be kept in mind</LINE>
<LINE>But the fair of Rosalind.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll rhyme you so eight years together, dinners and</LINE>
<LINE>suppers and sleeping-hours excepted: it is the</LINE>
<LINE>right butter-women's rank to market.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Out, fool!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For a taste:</LINE>
<LINE>If a hart do lack a hind,</LINE>
<LINE>Let him seek out Rosalind.</LINE>
<LINE>If the cat will after kind,</LINE>
<LINE>So be sure will Rosalind.</LINE>
<LINE>Winter garments must be lined,</LINE>
<LINE>So must slender Rosalind.</LINE>
<LINE>They that reap must sheaf and bind;</LINE>
<LINE>Then to cart with Rosalind.</LINE>
<LINE>Sweetest nut hath sourest rind,</LINE>
<LINE>Such a nut is Rosalind.</LINE>
<LINE>He that sweetest rose will find</LINE>
<LINE>Must find love's prick and Rosalind.</LINE>
<LINE>This is the very false gallop of verses: why do you</LINE>
<LINE>infect yourself with them?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Peace, you dull fool! I found them on a tree.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Truly, the tree yields bad fruit.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll graff it with you, and then I shall graff it</LINE>
<LINE>with a medlar: then it will be the earliest fruit</LINE>
<LINE>i' the country; for you'll be rotten ere you be half</LINE>
<LINE>ripe, and that's the right virtue of the medlar.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You have said; but whether wisely or no, let the</LINE>
<LINE>forest judge.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter CELIA, with a writing</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Peace! Here comes my sister, reading: stand aside.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Reads</STAGEDIR></LINE>
<LINE>Why should this a desert be?</LINE>
<LINE>For it is unpeopled? No:</LINE>
<LINE>Tongues I'll hang on every tree,</LINE>
<LINE>That shall civil sayings show:</LINE>
<LINE>Some, how brief the life of man</LINE>
<LINE>Runs his erring pilgrimage,</LINE>
<LINE>That the stretching of a span</LINE>
<LINE>Buckles in his sum of age;</LINE>
<LINE>Some, of violated vows</LINE>
<LINE>'Twixt the souls of friend and friend:</LINE>
<LINE>But upon the fairest boughs,</LINE>
<LINE>Or at every sentence end,</LINE>
<LINE>Will I Rosalinda write,</LINE>
<LINE>Teaching all that read to know</LINE>
<LINE>The quintessence of every sprite</LINE>
<LINE>Heaven would in little show.</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore Heaven Nature charged</LINE>
<LINE>That one body should be fill'd</LINE>
<LINE>With all graces wide-enlarged:</LINE>
<LINE>Nature presently distill'd</LINE>
<LINE>Helen's cheek, but not her heart,</LINE>
<LINE>Cleopatra's majesty,</LINE>
<LINE>Atalanta's better part,</LINE>
<LINE>Sad Lucretia's modesty.</LINE>
<LINE>Thus Rosalind of many parts</LINE>
<LINE>By heavenly synod was devised,</LINE>
<LINE>Of many faces, eyes and hearts,</LINE>
<LINE>To have the touches dearest prized.</LINE>
<LINE>Heaven would that she these gifts should have,</LINE>
<LINE>And I to live and die her slave.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O most gentle pulpiter! what tedious homily of love</LINE>
<LINE>have you wearied your parishioners withal, and never</LINE>
<LINE>cried 'Have patience, good people!'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How now! back, friends! Shepherd, go off a little.</LINE>
<LINE>Go with him, sirrah.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, shepherd, let us make an honourable retreat;</LINE>
<LINE>though not with bag and baggage, yet with scrip and scrippage.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt CORIN and TOUCHSTONE</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Didst thou hear these verses?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, yes, I heard them all, and more too; for some of</LINE>
<LINE>them had in them more feet than the verses would bear.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That's no matter: the feet might bear the verses.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, but the feet were lame and could not bear</LINE>
<LINE>themselves without the verse and therefore stood</LINE>
<LINE>lamely in the verse.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But didst thou hear without wondering how thy name</LINE>
<LINE>should be hanged and carved upon these trees?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I was seven of the nine days out of the wonder</LINE>
<LINE>before you came; for look here what I found on a</LINE>
<LINE>palm-tree. I was never so be-rhymed since</LINE>
<LINE>Pythagoras' time, that I was an Irish rat, which I</LINE>
<LINE>can hardly remember.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Trow you who hath done this?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is it a man?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And a chain, that you once wore, about his neck.</LINE>
<LINE>Change you colour?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I prithee, who?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O Lord, Lord! it is a hard matter for friends to</LINE>
<LINE>meet; but mountains may be removed with earthquakes</LINE>
<LINE>and so encounter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, but who is it?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is it possible?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, I prithee now with most petitionary vehemence,</LINE>
<LINE>tell me who it is.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O wonderful, wonderful, and most wonderful</LINE>
<LINE>wonderful! and yet again wonderful, and after that,</LINE>
<LINE>out of all hooping!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good my complexion! dost thou think, though I am</LINE>
<LINE>caparisoned like a man, I have a doublet and hose in</LINE>
<LINE>my disposition? One inch of delay more is a</LINE>
<LINE>South-sea of discovery; I prithee, tell me who is it</LINE>
<LINE>quickly, and speak apace. I would thou couldst</LINE>
<LINE>stammer, that thou mightst pour this concealed man</LINE>
<LINE>out of thy mouth, as wine comes out of a narrow-</LINE>
<LINE>mouthed bottle, either too much at once, or none at</LINE>
<LINE>all. I prithee, take the cork out of thy mouth that</LINE>
<LINE>may drink thy tidings.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So you may put a man in your belly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is he of God's making? What manner of man? Is his</LINE>
<LINE>head worth a hat, or his chin worth a beard?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, he hath but a little beard.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, God will send more, if the man will be</LINE>
<LINE>thankful: let me stay the growth of his beard, if</LINE>
<LINE>thou delay me not the knowledge of his chin.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is young Orlando, that tripped up the wrestler's</LINE>
<LINE>heels and your heart both in an instant.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, but the devil take mocking: speak, sad brow and</LINE>
<LINE>true maid.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I' faith, coz, 'tis he.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Orlando?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Orlando.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alas the day! what shall I do with my doublet and</LINE>
<LINE>hose? What did he when thou sawest him? What said</LINE>
<LINE>he? How looked he? Wherein went he? What makes</LINE>
<LINE>him here? Did he ask for me? Where remains he?</LINE>
<LINE>How parted he with thee? and when shalt thou see</LINE>
<LINE>him again? Answer me in one word.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You must borrow me Gargantua's mouth first: 'tis a</LINE>
<LINE>word too great for any mouth of this age's size. To</LINE>
<LINE>say ay and no to these particulars is more than to</LINE>
<LINE>answer in a catechism.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But doth he know that I am in this forest and in</LINE>
<LINE>man's apparel? Looks he as freshly as he did the</LINE>
<LINE>day he wrestled?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the</LINE>
<LINE>propositions of a lover; but take a taste of my</LINE>
<LINE>finding him, and relish it with good observance.</LINE>
<LINE>I found him under a tree, like a dropped acorn.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It may well be called Jove's tree, when it drops</LINE>
<LINE>forth such fruit.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Give me audience, good madam.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Proceed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There lay he, stretched along, like a wounded knight.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Though it be pity to see such a sight, it well</LINE>
<LINE>becomes the ground.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Cry 'holla' to thy tongue, I prithee; it curvets</LINE>
<LINE>unseasonably. He was furnished like a hunter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, ominous! he comes to kill my heart.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would sing my song without a burden: thou bringest</LINE>
<LINE>me out of tune.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do you not know I am a woman? when I think, I must</LINE>
<LINE>speak. Sweet, say on.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You bring me out. Soft! comes he not here?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter ORLANDO and JAQUES</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis he: slink by, and note him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I thank you for your company; but, good faith, I had</LINE>
<LINE>as lief have been myself alone.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And so had I; but yet, for fashion sake, I thank you</LINE>
<LINE>too for your society.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>God be wi' you: let's meet as little as we can.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do desire we may be better strangers.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I pray you, mar no more trees with writing</LINE>
<LINE>love-songs in their barks.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I pray you, mar no more of my verses with reading</LINE>
<LINE>them ill-favouredly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Rosalind is your love's name?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, just.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do not like her name.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There was no thought of pleasing you when she was</LINE>
<LINE>christened.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What stature is she of?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Just as high as my heart.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You are full of pretty answers. Have you not been</LINE>
<LINE>acquainted with goldsmiths' wives, and conned them</LINE>
<LINE>out of rings?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not so; but I answer you right painted cloth, from</LINE>
<LINE>whence you have studied your questions.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You have a nimble wit: I think 'twas made of</LINE>
<LINE>Atalanta's heels. Will you sit down with me? and</LINE>
<LINE>we two will rail against our mistress the world and</LINE>
<LINE>all our misery.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will chide no breather in the world but myself,</LINE>
<LINE>against whom I know most faults.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The worst fault you have is to be in love.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis a fault I will not change for your best virtue.</LINE>
<LINE>I am weary of you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By my troth, I was seeking for a fool when I found</LINE>
<LINE>you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He is drowned in the brook: look but in, and you</LINE>
<LINE>shall see him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There I shall see mine own figure.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Which I take to be either a fool or a cipher.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll tarry no longer with you: farewell, good</LINE>
<LINE>Signior Love.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am glad of your departure: adieu, good Monsieur</LINE>
<LINE>Melancholy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit JAQUES</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside to CELIA</STAGEDIR>  I will speak to him, like a saucy</LINE>
<LINE>lackey and under that habit play the knave with him.</LINE>
<LINE>Do you hear, forester?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Very well: what would you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I pray you, what is't o'clock?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You should ask me what time o' day: there's no clock</LINE>
<LINE>in the forest.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then there is no true lover in the forest; else</LINE>
<LINE>sighing every minute and groaning every hour would</LINE>
<LINE>detect the lazy foot of Time as well as a clock.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And why not the swift foot of Time? had not that</LINE>
<LINE>been as proper?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By no means, sir: Time travels in divers paces with</LINE>
<LINE>divers persons. I'll tell you who Time ambles</LINE>
<LINE>withal, who Time trots withal, who Time gallops</LINE>
<LINE>withal and who he stands still withal.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I prithee, who doth he trot withal?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, he trots hard with a young maid between the</LINE>
<LINE>contract of her marriage and the day it is</LINE>
<LINE>solemnized: if the interim be but a se'nnight,</LINE>
<LINE>Time's pace is so hard that it seems the length of</LINE>
<LINE>seven year.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who ambles Time withal?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that</LINE>
<LINE>hath not the gout, for the one sleeps easily because</LINE>
<LINE>he cannot study, and the other lives merrily because</LINE>
<LINE>he feels no pain, the one lacking the burden of lean</LINE>
<LINE>and wasteful learning, the other knowing no burden</LINE>
<LINE>of heavy tedious penury; these Time ambles withal.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who doth he gallop withal?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With a thief to the gallows, for though he go as</LINE>
<LINE>softly as foot can fall, he thinks himself too soon there.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who stays it still withal?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With lawyers in the vacation, for they sleep between</LINE>
<LINE>term and term and then they perceive not how Time moves.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where dwell you, pretty youth?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With this shepherdess, my sister; here in the</LINE>
<LINE>skirts of the forest, like fringe upon a petticoat.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Are you native of this place?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As the cony that you see dwell where she is kindled.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your accent is something finer than you could</LINE>
<LINE>purchase in so removed a dwelling.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have been told so of many: but indeed an old</LINE>
<LINE>religious uncle of mine taught me to speak, who was</LINE>
<LINE>in his youth an inland man; one that knew courtship</LINE>
<LINE>too well, for there he fell in love. I have heard</LINE>
<LINE>him read many lectures against it, and I thank God</LINE>
<LINE>I am not a woman, to be touched with so many</LINE>
<LINE>giddy offences as he hath generally taxed their</LINE>
<LINE>whole sex withal.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Can you remember any of the principal evils that he</LINE>
<LINE>laid to the charge of women?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There were none principal; they were all like one</LINE>
<LINE>another as half-pence are, every one fault seeming</LINE>
<LINE>monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I prithee, recount some of them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, I will not cast away my physic but on those that</LINE>
<LINE>are sick. There is a man haunts the forest, that</LINE>
<LINE>abuses our young plants with carving 'Rosalind' on</LINE>
<LINE>their barks; hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies</LINE>
<LINE>on brambles, all, forsooth, deifying the name of</LINE>
<LINE>Rosalind: if I could meet that fancy-monger I would</LINE>
<LINE>give him some good counsel, for he seems to have the</LINE>
<LINE>quotidian of love upon him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am he that is so love-shaked: I pray you tell me</LINE>
<LINE>your remedy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There is none of my uncle's marks upon you: he</LINE>
<LINE>taught me how to know a man in love; in which cage</LINE>
<LINE>of rushes I am sure you are not prisoner.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What were his marks?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A lean cheek, which you have not, a blue eye and</LINE>
<LINE>sunken, which you have not, an unquestionable</LINE>
<LINE>spirit, which you have not, a beard neglected,</LINE>
<LINE>which you have not; but I pardon you for that, for</LINE>
<LINE>simply your having in beard is a younger brother's</LINE>
<LINE>revenue: then your hose should be ungartered, your</LINE>
<LINE>bonnet unbanded, your sleeve unbuttoned, your shoe</LINE>
<LINE>untied and every thing about you demonstrating a</LINE>
<LINE>careless desolation; but you are no such man; you</LINE>
<LINE>are rather point-device in your accoutrements as</LINE>
<LINE>loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Me believe it! you may as soon make her that you</LINE>
<LINE>love believe it; which, I warrant, she is apter to</LINE>
<LINE>do than to confess she does: that is one of the</LINE>
<LINE>points in the which women still give the lie to</LINE>
<LINE>their consciences. But, in good sooth, are you he</LINE>
<LINE>that hangs the verses on the trees, wherein Rosalind</LINE>
<LINE>is so admired?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of</LINE>
<LINE>Rosalind, I am that he, that unfortunate he.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Love is merely a madness, and, I tell you, deserves</LINE>
<LINE>as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do: and</LINE>
<LINE>the reason why they are not so punished and cured</LINE>
<LINE>is, that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers</LINE>
<LINE>are in love too. Yet I profess curing it by counsel.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Did you ever cure any so?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, one, and in this manner. He was to imagine me</LINE>
<LINE>his love, his mistress; and I set him every day to</LINE>
<LINE>woo me: at which time would I, being but a moonish</LINE>
<LINE>youth, grieve, be effeminate, changeable, longing</LINE>
<LINE>and liking, proud, fantastical, apish, shallow,</LINE>
<LINE>inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles, for every</LINE>
<LINE>passion something and for no passion truly any</LINE>
<LINE>thing, as boys and women are for the most part</LINE>
<LINE>cattle of this colour; would now like him, now loathe</LINE>
<LINE>him; then entertain him, then forswear him; now weep</LINE>
<LINE>for him, then spit at him; that I drave my suitor</LINE>
<LINE>from his mad humour of love to a living humour of</LINE>
<LINE>madness; which was, to forswear the full stream of</LINE>
<LINE>the world, and to live in a nook merely monastic.</LINE>
<LINE>And thus I cured him; and this way will I take upon</LINE>
<LINE>me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep's</LINE>
<LINE>heart, that there shall not be one spot of love in't.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would not be cured, youth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would cure you, if you would but call me Rosalind</LINE>
<LINE>and come every day to my cote and woo me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, by the faith of my love, I will: tell me</LINE>
<LINE>where it is.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go with me to it and I'll show it you and by the way</LINE>
<LINE>you shall tell me where in the forest you live.</LINE>
<LINE>Will you go?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With all my heart, good youth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay you must call me Rosalind. Come, sister, will you go?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>When a man's verses cannot be understood, nor a</LINE>

<LINE>deed and word? is it a true thing?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, truly; for the truest poetry is the most</LINE>
<LINE>feigning; and lovers are given to poetry, and what</LINE>
<LINE>they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUDREY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do, truly; for thou swearest to me thou art</LINE>
<LINE>honest: now, if thou wert a poet, I might have some</LINE>
<LINE>hope thou didst feign.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUDREY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Would you not have me honest?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, truly, unless thou wert hard-favoured; for</LINE>
<LINE>honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  A material fool!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUDREY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, I am not fair; and therefore I pray the gods</LINE>
<LINE>make me honest.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Truly, and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut</LINE>
<LINE>were to put good meat into an unclean dish.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUDREY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am not a slut, though I thank the gods I am foul.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, praised be the gods for thy foulness!</LINE>
<LINE>sluttishness may come hereafter. But be it as it may</LINE>
<LINE>be, I will marry thee, and to that end I have been</LINE>
<LINE>with Sir Oliver Martext, the vicar of the next</LINE>
<LINE>village, who hath promised to meet me in this place</LINE>
<LINE>of the forest and to couple us.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  I would fain see this meeting.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUDREY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, the gods give us joy!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Amen. A man may, if he were of a fearful heart,</LINE>
<LINE>stagger in this attempt; for here we have no temple</LINE>
<LINE>but the wood, no assembly but horn-beasts. But what</LINE>
<LINE>though? Courage! As horns are odious, they are</LINE>
<LINE>necessary. It is said, 'many a man knows no end of</LINE>
<LINE>his goods:' right; many a man has good horns, and</LINE>
<LINE>knows no end of them. Well, that is the dowry of</LINE>
<LINE>his wife; 'tis none of his own getting. Horns?</LINE>
<LINE>Even so. Poor men alone? No, no; the noblest deer</LINE>
<LINE>hath them as huge as the rascal. Is the single man</LINE>
<LINE>therefore blessed? No: as a walled town is more</LINE>
<LINE>worthier than a village, so is the forehead of a</LINE>
<LINE>married man more honourable than the bare brow of a</LINE>
<LINE>bachelor; and by how much defence is better than no</LINE>
<LINE>skill, by so much is a horn more precious than to</LINE>
<LINE>want. Here comes Sir Oliver.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter SIR OLIVER MARTEXT</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Sir Oliver Martext, you are well met: will you</LINE>
<LINE>dispatch us here under this tree, or shall we go</LINE>
<LINE>with you to your chapel?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR OLIVER MARTEXT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is there none here to give the woman?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will not take her on gift of any man.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR OLIVER MARTEXT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Truly, she must be given, or the marriage is not lawful.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Advancing</STAGEDIR></LINE>
<LINE>Proceed, proceed I'll give her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good even, good Master What-ye-call't: how do you,</LINE>
<LINE>sir? You are very well met: God 'ild you for your</LINE>
<LINE>last company: I am very glad to see you: even a</LINE>
<LINE>toy in hand here, sir: nay, pray be covered.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Will you be married, motley?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As the ox hath his bow, sir, the horse his curb and</LINE>
<LINE>the falcon her bells, so man hath his desires; and</LINE>
<LINE>as pigeons bill, so wedlock would be nibbling.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And will you, being a man of your breeding, be</LINE>
<LINE>married under a bush like a beggar? Get you to</LINE>
<LINE>church, and have a good priest that can tell you</LINE>
<LINE>what marriage is: this fellow will but join you</LINE>
<LINE>together as they join wainscot; then one of you will</LINE>
<LINE>prove a shrunk panel and, like green timber, warp, warp.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  I am not in the mind but I were better to be</LINE>
<LINE>married of him than of another: for he is not like</LINE>
<LINE>to marry me well; and not being well married, it</LINE>
<LINE>will be a good excuse for me hereafter to leave my wife.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go thou with me, and let me counsel thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Come, sweet Audrey:</LINE>
<LINE>We must be married, or we must live in bawdry.</LINE>
<LINE>Farewell, good Master Oliver: not,--</LINE>
<LINE>O sweet Oliver,</LINE>
<LINE>O brave Oliver,</LINE>
<LINE>Leave me not behind thee: but,--</LINE>
<LINE>Wind away,</LINE>
<LINE>Begone, I say,</LINE>
<LINE>I will not to wedding with thee.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter ROSALIND and CELIA</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Never talk to me; I will weep.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do, I prithee; but yet have the grace to consider</LINE>
<LINE>that tears do not become a man.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But have I not cause to weep?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As good cause as one would desire; therefore weep.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>His very hair is of the dissembling colour.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Something browner than Judas's marry, his kisses are</LINE>
<LINE>Judas's own children.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I' faith, his hair is of a good colour.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>An excellent colour: your chestnut was ever the only colour.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch</LINE>
<LINE>of holy bread.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana: a nun</LINE>
<LINE>of winter's sisterhood kisses not more religiously;</LINE>
<LINE>the very ice of chastity is in them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But why did he swear he would come this morning, and</LINE>
<LINE>comes not?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, certainly, there is no truth in him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do you think so?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes; I think he is not a pick-purse nor a</LINE>
<LINE>horse-stealer, but for his verity in love, I do</LINE>
<LINE>think him as concave as a covered goblet or a</LINE>
<LINE>worm-eaten nut.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not true in love?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, when he is in; but I think he is not in.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You have heard him swear downright he was.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Was' is not 'is:' besides, the oath of a lover is</LINE>
<LINE>no stronger than the word of a tapster; they are</LINE>
<LINE>both the confirmer of false reckonings. He attends</LINE>
<LINE>here in the forest on the duke your father.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I met the duke yesterday and had much question with</LINE>
<LINE>him: he asked me of what parentage I was; I told</LINE>
<LINE>him, of as good as he; so he laughed and let me go.</LINE>
<LINE>But what talk we of fathers, when there is such a</LINE>
<LINE>man as Orlando?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, that's a brave man! he writes brave verses,</LINE>
<LINE>speaks brave words, swears brave oaths and breaks</LINE>
<LINE>them bravely, quite traverse, athwart the heart of</LINE>
<LINE>his lover; as a puisny tilter, that spurs his horse</LINE>
<LINE>but on one side, breaks his staff like a noble</LINE>
<LINE>goose: but all's brave that youth mounts and folly</LINE>
<LINE>guides. Who comes here?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter CORIN</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Mistress and master, you have oft inquired</LINE>
<LINE>After the shepherd that complain'd of love,</LINE>
<LINE>Who you saw sitting by me on the turf,</LINE>
<LINE>Praising the proud disdainful shepherdess</LINE>
<LINE>That was his mistress.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, and what of him?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If you will see a pageant truly play'd,</LINE>
<LINE>Between the pale complexion of true love</LINE>
<LINE>And the red glow of scorn and proud disdain,</LINE>
<LINE>Go hence a little and I shall conduct you,</LINE>
<LINE>If you will mark it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, come, let us remove:</LINE>
<LINE>The sight of lovers feedeth those in love.</LINE>
<LINE>Bring us to this sight, and you shall say</LINE>
<LINE>I'll prove a busy actor in their play.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter SILVIUS and PHEBE</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SILVIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sweet Phebe, do not scorn me; do not, Phebe;</LINE>
<LINE>Say that you love me not, but say not so</LINE>
<LINE>In bitterness. The common executioner,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose heart the accustom'd sight of death makes hard,</LINE>
<LINE>Falls not the axe upon the humbled neck</LINE>
<LINE>But first begs pardon: will you sterner be</LINE>
<LINE>Than he that dies and lives by bloody drops?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter ROSALIND, CELIA, and CORIN, behind</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PHEBE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would not be thy executioner:</LINE>
<LINE>I fly thee, for I would not injure thee.</LINE>
<LINE>Thou tell'st me there is murder in mine eye:</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis pretty, sure, and very probable,</LINE>
<LINE>That eyes, that are the frail'st and softest things,</LINE>
<LINE>Who shut their coward gates on atomies,</LINE>
<LINE>Should be call'd tyrants, butchers, murderers!</LINE>
<LINE>Now I do frown on thee with all my heart;</LINE>
<LINE>And if mine eyes can wound, now let them kill thee:</LINE>
<LINE>Now counterfeit to swoon; why now fall down;</LINE>
<LINE>Or if thou canst not, O, for shame, for shame,</LINE>
<LINE>Lie not, to say mine eyes are murderers!</LINE>
<LINE>Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee:</LINE>
<LINE>Scratch thee but with a pin, and there remains</LINE>
<LINE>Some scar of it; lean but upon a rush,</LINE>
<LINE>The cicatrice and capable impressure</LINE>
<LINE>Thy palm some moment keeps; but now mine eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>Which I have darted at thee, hurt thee not,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor, I am sure, there is no force in eyes</LINE>
<LINE>That can do hurt.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SILVIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O dear Phebe,</LINE>
<LINE>If ever,--as that ever may be near,--</LINE>
<LINE>You meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy,</LINE>
<LINE>Then shall you know the wounds invisible</LINE>
<LINE>That love's keen arrows make.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PHEBE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But till that time</LINE>
<LINE>Come not thou near me: and when that time comes,</LINE>
<LINE>Afflict me with thy mocks, pity me not;</LINE>
<LINE>As till that time I shall not pity thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And why, I pray you? Who might be your mother,</LINE>
<LINE>That you insult, exult, and all at once,</LINE>
<LINE>Over the wretched? What though you have no beauty,--</LINE>
<LINE>As, by my faith, I see no more in you</LINE>
<LINE>Than without candle may go dark to bed--</LINE>
<LINE>Must you be therefore proud and pitiless?</LINE>
<LINE>Why, what means this? Why do you look on me?</LINE>
<LINE>I see no more in you than in the ordinary</LINE>
<LINE>Of nature's sale-work. 'Od's my little life,</LINE>
<LINE>I think she means to tangle my eyes too!</LINE>
<LINE>No, faith, proud mistress, hope not after it:</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis not your inky brows, your black silk hair,</LINE>
<LINE>Your bugle eyeballs, nor your cheek of cream,</LINE>
<LINE>That can entame my spirits to your worship.</LINE>
<LINE>You foolish shepherd, wherefore do you follow her,</LINE>
<LINE>Like foggy south puffing with wind and rain?</LINE>
<LINE>You are a thousand times a properer man</LINE>
<LINE>Than she a woman: 'tis such fools as you</LINE>
<LINE>That makes the world full of ill-favour'd children:</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis not her glass, but you, that flatters her;</LINE>
<LINE>And out of you she sees herself more proper</LINE>
<LINE>Than any of her lineaments can show her.</LINE>
<LINE>But, mistress, know yourself: down on your knees,</LINE>
<LINE>And thank heaven, fasting, for a good man's love:</LINE>
<LINE>For I must tell you friendly in your ear,</LINE>
<LINE>Sell when you can: you are not for all markets:</LINE>
<LINE>Cry the man mercy; love him; take his offer:</LINE>
<LINE>Foul is most foul, being foul to be a scoffer.</LINE>
<LINE>So take her to thee, shepherd: fare you well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PHEBE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sweet youth, I pray you, chide a year together:</LINE>
<LINE>I had rather hear you chide than this man woo.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He's fallen in love with your foulness and she'll</LINE>
<LINE>fall in love with my anger. If it be so, as fast as</LINE>
<LINE>she answers thee with frowning looks, I'll sauce her</LINE>
<LINE>with bitter words. Why look you so upon me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PHEBE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For no ill will I bear you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I pray you, do not fall in love with me,</LINE>
<LINE>For I am falser than vows made in wine:</LINE>
<LINE>Besides, I like you not. If you will know my house,</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis at the tuft of olives here hard by.</LINE>
<LINE>Will you go, sister? Shepherd, ply her hard.</LINE>
<LINE>Come, sister. Shepherdess, look on him better,</LINE>
<LINE>And be not proud: though all the world could see,</LINE>
<LINE>None could be so abused in sight as he.</LINE>
<LINE>Come, to our flock.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt ROSALIND, CELIA and CORIN</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PHEBE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Dead Shepherd, now I find thy saw of might,</LINE>
<LINE>'Who ever loved that loved not at first sight?'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SILVIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sweet Phebe,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PHEBE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ha, what say'st thou, Silvius?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SILVIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sweet Phebe, pity me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PHEBE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, I am sorry for thee, gentle Silvius.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SILVIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Wherever sorrow is, relief would be:</LINE>
<LINE>If you do sorrow at my grief in love,</LINE>
<LINE>By giving love your sorrow and my grief</LINE>
<LINE>Were both extermined.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PHEBE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou hast my love: is not that neighbourly?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SILVIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would have you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PHEBE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, that were covetousness.</LINE>
<LINE>Silvius, the time was that I hated thee,</LINE>
<LINE>And yet it is not that I bear thee love;</LINE>
<LINE>But since that thou canst talk of love so well,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy company, which erst was irksome to me,</LINE>
<LINE>I will endure, and I'll employ thee too:</LINE>
<LINE>But do not look for further recompense</LINE>
<LINE>Than thine own gladness that thou art employ'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SILVIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So holy and so perfect is my love,</LINE>
<LINE>And I in such a poverty of grace,</LINE>
<LINE>That I shall think it a most plenteous crop</LINE>
<LINE>To glean the broken ears after the man</LINE>
<LINE>That the main harvest reaps: loose now and then</LINE>
<LINE>A scatter'd smile, and that I'll live upon.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PHEBE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Know'st now the youth that spoke to me erewhile?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SILVIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not very well, but I have met him oft;</LINE>
<LINE>And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds</LINE>
<LINE>That the old carlot once was master of.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PHEBE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Think not I love him, though I ask for him:</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis but a peevish boy; yet he talks well;</LINE>
<LINE>But what care I for words? yet words do well</LINE>
<LINE>When he that speaks them pleases those that hear.</LINE>
<LINE>It is a pretty youth: not very pretty:</LINE>
<LINE>But, sure, he's proud, and yet his pride becomes him:</LINE>
<LINE>He'll make a proper man: the best thing in him</LINE>
<LINE>Is his complexion; and faster than his tongue</LINE>
<LINE>Did make offence his eye did heal it up.</LINE>
<LINE>He is not very tall; yet for his years he's tall:</LINE>
<LINE>His leg is but so so; and yet 'tis well:</LINE>
<LINE>There was a pretty redness in his lip,</LINE>
<LINE>A little riper and more lusty red</LINE>
<LINE>Than that mix'd in his cheek; 'twas just the difference</LINE>
<LINE>Between the constant red and mingled damask.</LINE>
<LINE>There be some women, Silvius, had they mark'd him</LINE>
<LINE>In parcels as I did, would have gone near</LINE>
<LINE>To fall in love with him; but, for my part,</LINE>
<LINE>I love him not nor hate him not; and yet</LINE>
<LINE>I have more cause to hate him than to love him:</LINE>
<LINE>For what had he to do to chide at me?</LINE>
<LINE>He said mine eyes were black and my hair black:</LINE>
<LINE>And, now I am remember'd, scorn'd at me:</LINE>
<LINE>I marvel why I answer'd not again:</LINE>
<LINE>But that's all one; omittance is no quittance.</LINE>
<LINE>I'll write to him a very taunting letter,</LINE>
<LINE>And thou shalt bear it: wilt thou, Silvius?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SILVIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Phebe, with all my heart.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PHEBE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll write it straight;</LINE>
<LINE>The matter's in my head and in my heart:</LINE>
<LINE>I will be bitter with him and passing short.</LINE>
<LINE>Go with me, Silvius.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have neither the scholar's melancholy, which is</LINE>

<LINE>soldier's, which is ambitious, nor the lawyer's,</LINE>
<LINE>which is politic, nor the lady's, which is nice, nor</LINE>
<LINE>the lover's, which is all these: but it is a</LINE>
<LINE>melancholy of mine own, compounded of many simples,</LINE>
<LINE>extracted from many objects, and indeed the sundry's</LINE>
<LINE>contemplation of my travels, in which my often</LINE>
<LINE>rumination wraps me m a most humorous sadness.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A traveller! By my faith, you have great reason to</LINE>
<LINE>be sad: I fear you have sold your own lands to see</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My fair Rosalind, I come within an hour of my promise.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Break an hour's promise in love! He that will</LINE>
<LINE>divide a minute into a thousand parts and break but</LINE>
<LINE>a part of the thousandth part of a minute in the</LINE>
<LINE>affairs of love, it may be said of him that Cupid</LINE>
<LINE>hath clapped him o' the shoulder, but I'll warrant</LINE>
<LINE>him heart-whole.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pardon me, dear Rosalind.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, an you be so tardy, come no more in my sight: I</LINE>
<LINE>had as lief be wooed of a snail.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Of a snail?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, of a snail; for though he comes slowly, he</LINE>
<LINE>carries his house on his head; a better jointure,</LINE>
<LINE>I think, than you make a woman: besides he brings</LINE>
<LINE>his destiny with him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What's that?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, horns, which such as you are fain to be</LINE>
<LINE>beholding to your wives for: but he comes armed in</LINE>
<LINE>his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Virtue is no horn-maker; and my Rosalind is virtuous.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And I am your Rosalind.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It pleases him to call you so; but he hath a</LINE>
<LINE>Rosalind of a better leer than you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, woo me, woo me, for now I am in a holiday</LINE>
<LINE>humour and like enough to consent. What would you</LINE>
<LINE>say to me now, an I were your very very Rosalind?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would kiss before I spoke.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, you were better speak first, and when you were</LINE>
<LINE>gravelled for lack of matter, you might take</LINE>
<LINE>occasion to kiss. Very good orators, when they are</LINE>
<LINE>out, they will spit; and for lovers lacking--God</LINE>
<LINE>warn us!--matter, the cleanliest shift is to kiss.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How if the kiss be denied?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then she puts you to entreaty, and there begins new matter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who could be out, being before his beloved mistress?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, that should you, if I were your mistress, or</LINE>
<LINE>I should think my honesty ranker than my wit.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, of my suit?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not out of your apparel, and yet out of your suit.</LINE>
<LINE>Am not I your Rosalind?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I take some joy to say you are, because I would be</LINE>
<LINE>talking of her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well in her person I say I will not have you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then in mine own person I die.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, faith, die by attorney. The poor world is</LINE>
<LINE>almost six thousand years old, and in all this time</LINE>
<LINE>there was not any man died in his own person,</LINE>
<LINE>videlicit, in a love-cause. Troilus had his brains</LINE>
<LINE>dashed out with a Grecian club; yet he did what he</LINE>
<LINE>could to die before, and he is one of the patterns</LINE>
<LINE>of love. Leander, he would have lived many a fair</LINE>
<LINE>year, though Hero had turned nun, if it had not been</LINE>
<LINE>for a hot midsummer night; for, good youth, he went</LINE>
<LINE>but forth to wash him in the Hellespont and being</LINE>
<LINE>taken with the cramp was drowned and the foolish</LINE>
<LINE>coroners of that age found it was 'Hero of Sestos.'</LINE>
<LINE>But these are all lies: men have died from time to</LINE>
<LINE>time and worms have eaten them, but not for love.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind,</LINE>
<LINE>for, I protest, her frown might kill me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By this hand, it will not kill a fly. But come, now</LINE>
<LINE>I will be your Rosalind in a more coming-on</LINE>
<LINE>disposition, and ask me what you will. I will grant</LINE>
<LINE>it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then love me, Rosalind.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, faith, will I, Fridays and Saturdays and all.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And wilt thou have me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, and twenty such.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What sayest thou?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Are you not good?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I hope so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why then, can one desire too much of a good thing?</LINE>
<LINE>Come, sister, you shall be the priest and marry us.</LINE>
<LINE>Give me your hand, Orlando. What do you say, sister?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pray thee, marry us.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I cannot say the words.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You must begin, 'Will you, Orlando--'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go to. Will you, Orlando, have to wife this Rosalind?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, but when?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why now; as fast as she can marry us.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then you must say 'I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I might ask you for your commission; but I do take</LINE>
<LINE>thee, Orlando, for my husband: there's a girl goes</LINE>
<LINE>before the priest; and certainly a woman's thought</LINE>
<LINE>runs before her actions.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So do all thoughts; they are winged.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now tell me how long you would have her after you</LINE>
<LINE>have possessed her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For ever and a day.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Say 'a day,' without the 'ever.' No, no, Orlando;</LINE>
<LINE>men are April when they woo, December when they wed:</LINE>
<LINE>maids are May when they are maids, but the sky</LINE>
<LINE>changes when they are wives. I will be more jealous</LINE>
<LINE>of thee than a Barbary cock-pigeon over his hen,</LINE>
<LINE>more clamorous than a parrot against rain, more</LINE>
<LINE>new-fangled than an ape, more giddy in my desires</LINE>
<LINE>than a monkey: I will weep for nothing, like Diana</LINE>
<LINE>in the fountain, and I will do that when you are</LINE>
<LINE>disposed to be merry; I will laugh like a hyen, and</LINE>
<LINE>that when thou art inclined to sleep.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But will my Rosalind do so?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By my life, she will do as I do.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, but she is wise.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Or else she could not have the wit to do this: the</LINE>
<LINE>wiser, the waywarder: make the doors upon a woman's</LINE>
<LINE>wit and it will out at the casement; shut that and</LINE>
<LINE>'twill out at the key-hole; stop that, 'twill fly</LINE>
<LINE>with the smoke out at the chimney.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say</LINE>
<LINE>'Wit, whither wilt?'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, you might keep that cheque for it till you met</LINE>
<LINE>your wife's wit going to your neighbour's bed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And what wit could wit have to excuse that?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, to say she came to seek you there. You shall</LINE>
<LINE>never take her without her answer, unless you take</LINE>
<LINE>her without her tongue. O, that woman that cannot</LINE>
<LINE>make her fault her husband's occasion, let her</LINE>
<LINE>never nurse her child herself, for she will breed</LINE>
<LINE>it like a fool!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For these two hours, Rosalind, I will leave thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alas! dear love, I cannot lack thee two hours.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I must attend the duke at dinner: by two o'clock I</LINE>
<LINE>will be with thee again.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, go your ways, go your ways; I knew what you</LINE>
<LINE>would prove: my friends told me as much, and I</LINE>
<LINE>thought no less: that flattering tongue of yours</LINE>
<LINE>won me: 'tis but one cast away, and so, come,</LINE>
<LINE>death! Two o'clock is your hour?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, sweet Rosalind.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By my troth, and in good earnest, and so God mend</LINE>
<LINE>me, and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous,</LINE>
<LINE>if you break one jot of your promise or come one</LINE>
<LINE>minute behind your hour, I will think you the most</LINE>
<LINE>pathetical break-promise and the most hollow lover</LINE>
<LINE>and the most unworthy of her you call Rosalind that</LINE>
<LINE>may be chosen out of the gross band of the</LINE>
<LINE>unfaithful: therefore beware my censure and keep</LINE>
<LINE>your promise.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my</LINE>
<LINE>Rosalind: so adieu.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, Time is the old justice that examines all such</LINE>
<LINE>offenders, and let Time try: adieu.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit ORLANDO</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You have simply misused our sex in your love-prate:</LINE>
<LINE>we must have your doublet and hose plucked over your</LINE>
<LINE>head, and show the world what the bird hath done to</LINE>
<LINE>her own nest.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz, that thou</LINE>
<LINE>didst know how many fathom deep I am in love! But</LINE>
<LINE>it cannot be sounded: my affection hath an unknown</LINE>
<LINE>bottom, like the bay of Portugal.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Or rather, bottomless, that as fast as you pour</LINE>
<LINE>affection in, it runs out.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, that same wicked bastard of Venus that was begot</LINE>
<LINE>of thought, conceived of spleen and born of madness,</LINE>
<LINE>that blind rascally boy that abuses every one's eyes</LINE>
<LINE>because his own are out, let him be judge how deep I</LINE>
<LINE>am in love. I'll tell thee, Aliena, I cannot be out</LINE>
<LINE>of the sight of Orlando: I'll go find a shadow and</LINE>
<LINE>sigh till he come.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Which is he that killed the deer?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>A Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, it was I.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let's present him to the duke, like a Roman</LINE>
<LINE>conqueror; and it would do well to set the deer's</LINE>
<LINE>horns upon his head, for a branch of victory. Have</LINE>
<LINE>you no song, forester, for this purpose?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Forester</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sing it: 'tis no matter how it be in tune, so it</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SUBHEAD>SONG.</SUBHEAD>
<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Forester</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What shall he have that kill'd the deer?</LINE>
<LINE>His leather skin and horns to wear.</LINE>
<LINE>Then sing him home;</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>The rest shall bear this burden</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Take thou no scorn to wear the horn;</LINE>
<LINE>It was a crest ere thou wast born:</LINE>
<LINE>Thy father's father wore it,</LINE>
<LINE>And thy father bore it:</LINE>
<LINE>The horn, the horn, the lusty horn</LINE>
<LINE>Is not a thing to laugh to scorn.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How say you now? Is it not past two o'clock? and</LINE>
<LINE>here much Orlando!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I warrant you, with pure love and troubled brain, he</LINE>
<LINE>hath ta'en his bow and arrows and is gone forth to</LINE>
<LINE>sleep. Look, who comes here.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter SILVIUS</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SILVIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My errand is to you, fair youth;</LINE>
<LINE>My gentle Phebe bid me give you this:</LINE>
<LINE>I know not the contents; but, as I guess</LINE>
<LINE>By the stern brow and waspish action</LINE>
<LINE>Which she did use as she was writing of it,</LINE>
<LINE>It bears an angry tenor: pardon me:</LINE>
<LINE>I am but as a guiltless messenger.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Patience herself would startle at this letter</LINE>
<LINE>And play the swaggerer; bear this, bear all:</LINE>
<LINE>She says I am not fair, that I lack manners;</LINE>
<LINE>She calls me proud, and that she could not love me,</LINE>
<LINE>Were man as rare as phoenix. 'Od's my will!</LINE>
<LINE>Her love is not the hare that I do hunt:</LINE>
<LINE>Why writes she so to me? Well, shepherd, well,</LINE>
<LINE>This is a letter of your own device.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SILVIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, I protest, I know not the contents:</LINE>
<LINE>Phebe did write it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, come, you are a fool</LINE>
<LINE>And turn'd into the extremity of love.</LINE>
<LINE>I saw her hand: she has a leathern hand.</LINE>
<LINE>A freestone-colour'd hand; I verily did think</LINE>
<LINE>That her old gloves were on, but 'twas her hands:</LINE>
<LINE>She has a huswife's hand; but that's no matter:</LINE>
<LINE>I say she never did invent this letter;</LINE>
<LINE>This is a man's invention and his hand.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SILVIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sure, it is hers.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, 'tis a boisterous and a cruel style.</LINE>
<LINE>A style for-challengers; why, she defies me,</LINE>
<LINE>Like Turk to Christian: women's gentle brain</LINE>
<LINE>Could not drop forth such giant-rude invention</LINE>
<LINE>Such Ethiope words, blacker in their effect</LINE>
<LINE>Than in their countenance. Will you hear the letter?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SILVIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So please you, for I never heard it yet;</LINE>
<LINE>Yet heard too much of Phebe's cruelty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She Phebes me: mark how the tyrant writes.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Reads</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Art thou god to shepherd turn'd,</LINE>
<LINE>That a maiden's heart hath burn'd?</LINE>
<LINE>Can a woman rail thus?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SILVIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Call you this railing?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Reads</STAGEDIR></LINE>
<LINE>Why, thy godhead laid apart,</LINE>
<LINE>Warr'st thou with a woman's heart?</LINE>
<LINE>Did you ever hear such railing?</LINE>
<LINE>Whiles the eye of man did woo me,</LINE>
<LINE>That could do no vengeance to me.</LINE>
<LINE>Meaning me a beast.</LINE>
<LINE>If the scorn of your bright eyne</LINE>
<LINE>Have power to raise such love in mine,</LINE>
<LINE>Alack, in me what strange effect</LINE>
<LINE>Would they work in mild aspect!</LINE>
<LINE>Whiles you chid me, I did love;</LINE>
<LINE>How then might your prayers move!</LINE>
<LINE>He that brings this love to thee</LINE>
<LINE>Little knows this love in me:</LINE>
<LINE>And by him seal up thy mind;</LINE>
<LINE>Whether that thy youth and kind</LINE>
<LINE>Will the faithful offer take</LINE>
<LINE>Of me and all that I can make;</LINE>
<LINE>Or else by him my love deny,</LINE>
<LINE>And then I'll study how to die.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SILVIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Call you this chiding?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alas, poor shepherd!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do you pity him? no, he deserves no pity. Wilt</LINE>
<LINE>thou love such a woman? What, to make thee an</LINE>
<LINE>instrument and play false strains upon thee! not to</LINE>
<LINE>be endured! Well, go your way to her, for I see</LINE>
<LINE>love hath made thee a tame snake, and say this to</LINE>
<LINE>her: that if she love me, I charge her to love</LINE>
<LINE>thee; if she will not, I will never have her unless</LINE>
<LINE>thou entreat for her. If you be a true lover,</LINE>
<LINE>hence, and not a word; for here comes more company.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit SILVIUS</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>Enter OLIVER</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLIVER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good morrow, fair ones: pray you, if you know,</LINE>
<LINE>Where in the purlieus of this forest stands</LINE>
<LINE>A sheep-cote fenced about with olive trees?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>West of this place, down in the neighbour bottom:</LINE>
<LINE>The rank of osiers by the murmuring stream</LINE>
<LINE>Left on your right hand brings you to the place.</LINE>
<LINE>But at this hour the house doth keep itself;</LINE>
<LINE>There's none within.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLIVER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If that an eye may profit by a tongue,</LINE>
<LINE>Then should I know you by description;</LINE>
<LINE>Such garments and such years: 'The boy is fair,</LINE>
<LINE>Of female favour, and bestows himself</LINE>
<LINE>Like a ripe sister: the woman low</LINE>
<LINE>And browner than her brother.' Are not you</LINE>
<LINE>The owner of the house I did inquire for?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is no boast, being ask'd, to say we are.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLIVER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Orlando doth commend him to you both,</LINE>
<LINE>And to that youth he calls his Rosalind</LINE>
<LINE>He sends this bloody napkin. Are you he?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am: what must we understand by this?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLIVER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Some of my shame; if you will know of me</LINE>
<LINE>What man I am, and how, and why, and where</LINE>
<LINE>This handkercher was stain'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I pray you, tell it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLIVER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>When last the young Orlando parted from you</LINE>
<LINE>He left a promise to return again</LINE>
<LINE>Within an hour, and pacing through the forest,</LINE>
<LINE>Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy,</LINE>
<LINE>Lo, what befell! he threw his eye aside,</LINE>
<LINE>And mark what object did present itself:</LINE>
<LINE>Under an oak, whose boughs were moss'd with age</LINE>
<LINE>And high top bald with dry antiquity,</LINE>
<LINE>A wretched ragged man, o'ergrown with hair,</LINE>
<LINE>Lay sleeping on his back: about his neck</LINE>
<LINE>A green and gilded snake had wreathed itself,</LINE>
<LINE>Who with her head nimble in threats approach'd</LINE>
<LINE>The opening of his mouth; but suddenly,</LINE>
<LINE>Seeing Orlando, it unlink'd itself,</LINE>
<LINE>And with indented glides did slip away</LINE>
<LINE>Into a bush: under which bush's shade</LINE>
<LINE>A lioness, with udders all drawn dry,</LINE>
<LINE>Lay couching, head on ground, with catlike watch,</LINE>
<LINE>When that the sleeping man should stir; for 'tis</LINE>
<LINE>The royal disposition of that beast</LINE>
<LINE>To prey on nothing that doth seem as dead:</LINE>
<LINE>This seen, Orlando did approach the man</LINE>
<LINE>And found it was his brother, his elder brother.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, I have heard him speak of that same brother;</LINE>
<LINE>And he did render him the most unnatural</LINE>
<LINE>That lived amongst men.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLIVER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And well he might so do,</LINE>
<LINE>For well I know he was unnatural.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But, to Orlando: did he leave him there,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLIVER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Twice did he turn his back and purposed so;</LINE>
<LINE>But kindness, nobler ever than revenge,</LINE>
<LINE>And nature, stronger than his just occasion,</LINE>
<LINE>Made him give battle to the lioness,</LINE>
<LINE>Who quickly fell before him: in which hurtling</LINE>
<LINE>From miserable slumber I awaked.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Was't you that did so oft contrive to kill him?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLIVER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Twas I; but 'tis not I I do not shame</LINE>

<LINE>So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But, for the bloody napkin?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLIVER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By and by.</LINE>
<LINE>When from the first to last betwixt us two</LINE>
<LINE>Tears our recountments had most kindly bathed,</LINE>
<LINE>As how I came into that desert place:--</LINE>
<LINE>In brief, he led me to the gentle duke,</LINE>
<LINE>Who gave me fresh array and entertainment,</LINE>
<LINE>Committing me unto my brother's love;</LINE>
<LINE>Who led me instantly unto his cave,</LINE>
<LINE>There stripp'd himself, and here upon his arm</LINE>
<LINE>The lioness had torn some flesh away,</LINE>
<LINE>Which all this while had bled; and now he fainted</LINE>
<LINE>And cried, in fainting, upon Rosalind.</LINE>
<LINE>Brief, I recover'd him, bound up his wound;</LINE>
<LINE>And, after some small space, being strong at heart,</LINE>
<LINE>He sent me hither, stranger as I am,</LINE>
<LINE>To tell this story, that you might excuse</LINE>
<LINE>His broken promise, and to give this napkin</LINE>
<LINE>Dyed in his blood unto the shepherd youth</LINE>
<LINE>That he in sport doth call his Rosalind.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>OLIVER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Be of good cheer, youth: you a man! you lack a</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do so, I confess it. Ah, sirrah, a body would</LINE>

<LINE>your brother how well I counterfeited. Heigh-ho!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLIVER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This was not counterfeit: there is too great</LINE>
<LINE>testimony in your complexion that it was a passion</LINE>
<LINE>of earnest.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Counterfeit, I assure you.</LINE>

<LINE>Well then, take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, thou sayest well. I do now remember a saying,</LINE>
<LINE>'The fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man</LINE>
<LINE>knows himself to be a fool.' The heathen</LINE>
<LINE>philosopher, when he had a desire to eat a grape,</LINE>
<LINE>would open his lips when he put it into his mouth;</LINE>
<LINE>meaning thereby that grapes were made to eat and</LINE>
<LINE>lips to open. You do love this maid?</LINE>

<LINE>No, sir.</LINE>

<LINE>is a figure in rhetoric that drink, being poured out</LINE>

<SPEAKER>OLIVER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Neither call the giddiness of it in question, the</LINE>

<LINE>I love Aliena; say with her that she loves me;</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is my arm.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws</LINE>
<LINE>of a lion.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Wounded it is, but with the eyes of a lady.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Did your brother tell you how I counterfeited to</LINE>
<LINE>swoon when he showed me your handkerchief?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, and greater wonders than that.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, I know where you are: nay, 'tis true: there was</LINE>
<LINE>never any thing so sudden but the fight of two rams</LINE>
<LINE>and Caesar's thrasonical brag of 'I came, saw, and</LINE>
<LINE>overcame:' for your brother and my sister no sooner</LINE>
<LINE>met but they looked, no sooner looked but they</LINE>
<LINE>loved, no sooner loved but they sighed, no sooner</LINE>
<LINE>sighed but they asked one another the reason, no</LINE>
<LINE>sooner knew the reason but they sought the remedy;</LINE>
<LINE>and in these degrees have they made a pair of stairs</LINE>
<LINE>to marriage which they will climb incontinent, or</LINE>
<LINE>else be incontinent before marriage: they are in</LINE>
<LINE>the very wrath of love and they will together; clubs</LINE>
<LINE>cannot part them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They shall be married to-morrow, and I will bid the</LINE>
<LINE>duke to the nuptial. But, O, how bitter a thing it</LINE>
<LINE>is to look into happiness through another man's</LINE>
<LINE>eyes! By so much the more shall I to-morrow be at</LINE>
<LINE>the height of heart-heaviness, by how much I shall</LINE>
<LINE>think my brother happy in having what he wishes for.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why then, to-morrow I cannot serve your turn for Rosalind?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I can live no longer by thinking.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will weary you then no longer with idle talking.</LINE>
<LINE>Know of me then, for now I speak to some purpose,</LINE>
<LINE>that I know you are a gentleman of good conceit: I</LINE>
<LINE>speak not this that you should bear a good opinion</LINE>
<LINE>of my knowledge, insomuch I say I know you are;</LINE>
<LINE>neither do I labour for a greater esteem than may in</LINE>
<LINE>some little measure draw a belief from you, to do</LINE>
<LINE>yourself good and not to grace me. Believe then, if</LINE>
<LINE>you please, that I can do strange things: I have,</LINE>
<LINE>since I was three year old, conversed with a</LINE>
<LINE>magician, most profound in his art and yet not</LINE>
<LINE>damnable. If you do love Rosalind so near the heart</LINE>
<LINE>as your gesture cries it out, when your brother</LINE>
<LINE>marries Aliena, shall you marry her: I know into</LINE>
<LINE>what straits of fortune she is driven; and it is</LINE>
<LINE>not impossible to me, if it appear not inconvenient</LINE>
<LINE>to you, to set her before your eyes tomorrow human</LINE>
<LINE>as she is and without any danger.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, the first time that I ever saw him</LINE>
<LINE>Methought he was a brother to your daughter:</LINE>
<LINE>But, my good lord, this boy is forest-born,</LINE>
<LINE>And hath been tutor'd in the rudiments</LINE>
<LINE>Of many desperate studies by his uncle,</LINE>
<LINE>Whom he reports to be a great magician,</LINE>
<LINE>Obscured in the circle of this forest.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Salutation and greeting to you all!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good my lord, bid him welcome: this is the</LINE>
<LINE>motley-minded gentleman that I have so often met in</LINE>
<LINE>the forest: he hath been a courtier, he swears.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If any man doubt that, let him put me to my</LINE>
<LINE>purgation. I have trod a measure; I have flattered</LINE>
<LINE>a lady; I have been politic with my friend, smooth</LINE>
<LINE>with mine enemy; I have undone three tailors; I have</LINE>
<LINE>had four quarrels, and like to have fought one.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And how was that ta'en up?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Faith, we met, and found the quarrel was upon the</LINE>
<LINE>seventh cause.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How seventh cause? Good my lord, like this fellow.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE SENIOR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I like him very well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>God 'ild you, sir; I desire you of the like. I</LINE>
<LINE>press in here, sir, amongst the rest of the country</LINE>
<LINE>copulatives, to swear and to forswear: according as</LINE>
<LINE>marriage binds and blood breaks: a poor virgin,</LINE>
<LINE>sir, an ill-favoured thing, sir, but mine own; a poor</LINE>
<LINE>humour of mine, sir, to take that that no man else</LINE>
<LINE>will: rich honesty dwells like a miser, sir, in a</LINE>
<LINE>poor house; as your pearl in your foul oyster.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE SENIOR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By my faith, he is very swift and sententious.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>According to the fool's bolt, sir, and such dulcet diseases.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But, for the seventh cause; how did you find the</LINE>
<LINE>quarrel on the seventh cause?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Upon a lie seven times removed:--bear your body more</LINE>
<LINE>seeming, Audrey:--as thus, sir. I did dislike the</LINE>
<LINE>cut of a certain courtier's beard: he sent me word,</LINE>
<LINE>if I said his beard was not cut well, he was in the</LINE>
<LINE>mind it was: this is called the Retort Courteous.</LINE>
<LINE>If I sent him word again 'it was not well cut,' he</LINE>
<LINE>would send me word, he cut it to please himself:</LINE>
<LINE>this is called the Quip Modest. If again 'it was</LINE>
<LINE>not well cut,' he disabled my judgment: this is</LINE>
<LINE>called the Reply Churlish. If again 'it was not</LINE>
<LINE>well cut,' he would answer, I spake not true: this</LINE>
<LINE>is called the Reproof Valiant. If again 'it was not</LINE>
<LINE>well cut,' he would say I lied: this is called the</LINE>
<LINE>Counter-cheque Quarrelsome: and so to the Lie</LINE>
<LINE>Circumstantial and the Lie Direct.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And how oft did you say his beard was not well cut?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I durst go no further than the Lie Circumstantial,</LINE>
<LINE>nor he durst not give me the Lie Direct; and so we</LINE>
<LINE>measured swords and parted.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O sir, we quarrel in print, by the book; as you have</LINE>
<LINE>books for good manners: I will name you the degrees.</LINE>
<LINE>The first, the Retort Courteous; the second, the</LINE>
<LINE>Quip Modest; the third, the Reply Churlish; the</LINE>
<LINE>fourth, the Reproof Valiant; the fifth, the</LINE>
<LINE>Countercheque Quarrelsome; the sixth, the Lie with</LINE>
<LINE>Circumstance; the seventh, the Lie Direct. All</LINE>
<LINE>these you may avoid but the Lie Direct; and you may</LINE>
<LINE>avoid that too, with an If. I knew when seven</LINE>
<LINE>justices could not take up a quarrel, but when the</LINE>
<LINE>parties were met themselves, one of them thought but</LINE>
<LINE>of an If, as, 'If you said so, then I said so;' and</LINE>
<LINE>they shook hands and swore brothers. Your If is the</LINE>
<LINE>only peacemaker; much virtue in If.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is not this a rare fellow, my lord? he's as good at</LINE>
<LINE>any thing and yet a fool.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE SENIOR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He uses his folly like a stalking-horse and under</LINE>

<SPEAKER>JAQUES DE BOYS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let me have audience for a word or two:</LINE>
<LINE>I am the second son of old Sir Rowland,</LINE>
<LINE>That bring these tidings to this fair assembly.</LINE>
<LINE>Duke Frederick, hearing how that every day</LINE>
<LINE>Men of great worth resorted to this forest,</LINE>
<LINE>Address'd a mighty power; which were on foot,</LINE>
<LINE>In his own conduct, purposely to take</LINE>
<LINE>His brother here and put him to the sword:</LINE>
<LINE>And to the skirts of this wild wood he came;</LINE>
<LINE>Where meeting with an old religious man,</LINE>
<LINE>After some question with him, was converted</LINE>
<LINE>Both from his enterprise and from the world,</LINE>
<LINE>His crown bequeathing to his banish'd brother,</LINE>
<LINE>And all their lands restored to them again</LINE>
<LINE>That were with him exiled. This to be true,</LINE>
<LINE>I do engage my life.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE SENIOR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Welcome, young man;</LINE>
<LINE>Thou offer'st fairly to thy brothers' wedding:</LINE>
<LINE>To one his lands withheld, and to the other</LINE>
<LINE>A land itself at large, a potent dukedom.</LINE>
<LINE>First, in this forest, let us do those ends</LINE>
<LINE>That here were well begun and well begot:</LINE>
<LINE>And after, every of this happy number</LINE>
<LINE>That have endured shrewd days and nights with us</LINE>
<LINE>Shall share the good of our returned fortune,</LINE>
<LINE>According to the measure of their states.</LINE>
<LINE>Meantime, forget this new-fall'n dignity</LINE>
<LINE>And fall into our rustic revelry.</LINE>
<LINE>Play, music! And you, brides and bridegrooms all,</LINE>
<LINE>With measure heap'd in joy, to the measures fall.</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Sir, by your patience. If I heard you rightly,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue;</LINE>
<LINE>but it is no more unhandsome than to see the lord</LINE>
<LINE>the prologue. If it be true that good wine needs</LINE>
<LINE>no bush, 'tis true that a good play needs no</LINE>
<LINE>epilogue; yet to good wine they do use good bushes,</LINE>
<LINE>and good plays prove the better by the help of good</LINE>
<LINE>epilogues. What a case am I in then, that am</LINE>
<LINE>neither a good epilogue nor cannot insinuate with</LINE>
<LINE>you in the behalf of a good play! I am not</LINE>
<LINE>furnished like a beggar, therefore to beg will not</LINE>
<LINE>become me: my way is to conjure you; and I'll begin</LINE>
<LINE>with the women. I charge you, O women, for the love</LINE>
<LINE>you bear to men, to like as much of this play as</LINE>
<LINE>please you: and I charge you, O men, for the love</LINE>
<LINE>you bear to women--as I perceive by your simpering,</LINE>
<LINE>none of you hates them--that between you and the</LINE>
<LINE>women the play may please. If I were a woman I</LINE>
<LINE>would kiss as many of you as had beards that pleased</LINE>
<LINE>me, complexions that liked me and breaths that I</LINE>
<LINE>defied not: and, I am sure, as many as have good</LINE>
<LINE>beards or good faces or sweet breaths will, for my</LINE>
<LINE>kind offer, when I make curtsy, bid me farewell.</LINE>
