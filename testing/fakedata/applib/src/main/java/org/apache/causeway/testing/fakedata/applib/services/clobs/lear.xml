<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I thought the king had more affected the Duke of</LINE>
<LINE>Albany than Cornwall.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It did always seem so to us: but now, in the</LINE>
<LINE>division of the kingdom, it appears not which of</LINE>
<LINE>the dukes he values most; for equalities are so</LINE>
<LINE>weighed, that curiosity in neither can make choice</LINE>
<LINE>of either's moiety.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is not this your son, my lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>His breeding, sir, hath been at my charge: I have</LINE>
<LINE>so often blushed to acknowledge him, that now I am</LINE>
<LINE>brazed to it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I cannot conceive you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, this young fellow's mother could: whereupon</LINE>
<LINE>she grew round-wombed, and had, indeed, sir, a son</LINE>
<LINE>for her cradle ere she had a husband for her bed.</LINE>
<LINE>Do you smell a fault?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of it</LINE>
<LINE>being so proper.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But I have, sir, a son by order of law, some year</LINE>
<LINE>elder than this, who yet is no dearer in my account:</LINE>
<LINE>though this knave came something saucily into the</LINE>
<LINE>world before he was sent for, yet was his mother</LINE>
<LINE>fair; there was good sport at his making, and the</LINE>
<LINE>whoreson must be acknowledged. Do you know this</LINE>
<LINE>noble gentleman, Edmund?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDMUND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord of Kent: remember him hereafter as my</LINE>
<LINE>honourable friend.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDMUND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My services to your lordship.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I must love you, and sue to know you better.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDMUND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, I shall study deserving.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He hath been out nine years, and away he shall</LINE>
<LINE>again. The king is coming.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Sennet. Enter KING LEAR, CORNWALL, ALBANY,
GONERIL, REGAN, CORDELIA, and Attendants</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Attend the lords of France and Burgundy, Gloucester.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I shall, my liege.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt GLOUCESTER and EDMUND</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Meantime we shall express our darker purpose.</LINE>
<LINE>Give me the map there. Know that we have divided</LINE>
<LINE>In three our kingdom: and 'tis our fast intent</LINE>
<LINE>To shake all cares and business from our age;</LINE>
<LINE>Conferring them on younger strengths, while we</LINE>
<LINE>Unburthen'd crawl toward death. Our son of Cornwall,</LINE>
<LINE>And you, our no less loving son of Albany,</LINE>
<LINE>We have this hour a constant will to publish</LINE>
<LINE>Our daughters' several dowers, that future strife</LINE>
<LINE>May be prevented now. The princes, France and Burgundy,</LINE>
<LINE>Great rivals in our youngest daughter's love,</LINE>
<LINE>Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn,</LINE>
<LINE>And here are to be answer'd. Tell me, my daughters,--</LINE>
<LINE>Since now we will divest us both of rule,</LINE>
<LINE>Interest of territory, cares of state,--</LINE>
<LINE>Which of you shall we say doth love us most?</LINE>
<LINE>That we our largest bounty may extend</LINE>
<LINE>Where nature doth with merit challenge. Goneril,</LINE>
<LINE>Our eldest-born, speak first.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GONERIL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, I love you more than words can wield the matter;</LINE>
<LINE>Dearer than eye-sight, space, and liberty;</LINE>
<LINE>Beyond what can be valued, rich or rare;</LINE>
<LINE>No less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honour;</LINE>
<LINE>As much as child e'er loved, or father found;</LINE>
<LINE>A love that makes breath poor, and speech unable;</LINE>
<LINE>Beyond all manner of so much I love you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORDELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  What shall Cordelia do?</LINE>
<LINE>Love, and be silent.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Of all these bounds, even from this line to this,</LINE>
<LINE>With shadowy forests and with champains rich'd,</LINE>
<LINE>With plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads,</LINE>
<LINE>We make thee lady: to thine and Albany's issue</LINE>
<LINE>Be this perpetual. What says our second daughter,</LINE>
<LINE>Our dearest Regan, wife to Cornwall? Speak.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REGAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, I am made</LINE>
<LINE>Of the self-same metal that my sister is,</LINE>
<LINE>And prize me at her worth. In my true heart</LINE>
<LINE>I find she names my very deed of love;</LINE>
<LINE>Only she comes too short: that I profess</LINE>
<LINE>Myself an enemy to all other joys,</LINE>
<LINE>Which the most precious square of sense possesses;</LINE>
<LINE>And find I am alone felicitate</LINE>
<LINE>In your dear highness' love.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORDELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR> Then poor Cordelia!</LINE>
<LINE>And yet not so; since, I am sure, my love's</LINE>
<LINE>More richer than my tongue.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To thee and thine hereditary ever</LINE>
<LINE>Remain this ample third of our fair kingdom;</LINE>
<LINE>No less in space, validity, and pleasure,</LINE>
<LINE>Than that conferr'd on Goneril. Now, our joy,</LINE>
<LINE>Although the last, not least; to whose young love</LINE>
<LINE>The vines of France and milk of Burgundy</LINE>
<LINE>Strive to be interess'd; what can you say to draw</LINE>
<LINE>A third more opulent than your sisters? Speak.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORDELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nothing, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nothing!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORDELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nothing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nothing will come of nothing: speak again.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORDELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave</LINE>
<LINE>My heart into my mouth: I love your majesty</LINE>
<LINE>According to my bond; nor more nor less.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How, how, Cordelia! mend your speech a little,</LINE>
<LINE>Lest it may mar your fortunes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORDELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good my lord,</LINE>
<LINE>You have begot me, bred me, loved me: I</LINE>
<LINE>Return those duties back as are right fit,</LINE>
<LINE>Obey you, love you, and most honour you.</LINE>
<LINE>Why have my sisters husbands, if they say</LINE>
<LINE>They love you all? Haply, when I shall wed,</LINE>
<LINE>That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry</LINE>
<LINE>Half my love with him, half my care and duty:</LINE>
<LINE>Sure, I shall never marry like my sisters,</LINE>
<LINE>To love my father all.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But goes thy heart with this?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORDELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, good my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So young, and so untender?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORDELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So young, my lord, and true.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let it be so; thy truth, then, be thy dower:</LINE>
<LINE>For, by the sacred radiance of the sun,</LINE>
<LINE>The mysteries of Hecate, and the night;</LINE>
<LINE>By all the operation of the orbs</LINE>
<LINE>From whom we do exist, and cease to be;</LINE>
<LINE>Here I disclaim all my paternal care,</LINE>
<LINE>Propinquity and property of blood,</LINE>
<LINE>And as a stranger to my heart and me</LINE>
<LINE>Hold thee, from this, for ever. The barbarous Scythian,</LINE>
<LINE>Or he that makes his generation messes</LINE>
<LINE>To gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom</LINE>
<LINE>Be as well neighbour'd, pitied, and relieved,</LINE>
<LINE>As thou my sometime daughter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good my liege,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Peace, Kent!</LINE>
<LINE>Come not between the dragon and his wrath.</LINE>
<LINE>I loved her most, and thought to set my rest</LINE>
<LINE>On her kind nursery. Hence, and avoid my sight!</LINE>
<LINE>So be my grave my peace, as here I give</LINE>
<LINE>Her father's heart from her! Call France; who stirs?</LINE>
<LINE>Call Burgundy. Cornwall and Albany,</LINE>
<LINE>With my two daughters' dowers digest this third:</LINE>
<LINE>Let pride, which she calls plainness, marry her.</LINE>
<LINE>I do invest you jointly with my power,</LINE>
<LINE>Pre-eminence, and all the large effects</LINE>
<LINE>That troop with majesty. Ourself, by monthly course,</LINE>
<LINE>With reservation of an hundred knights,</LINE>
<LINE>By you to be sustain'd, shall our abode</LINE>
<LINE>Make with you by due turns. Only we still retain</LINE>
<LINE>The name, and all the additions to a king;</LINE>
<LINE>The sway, revenue, execution of the rest,</LINE>
<LINE>Beloved sons, be yours: which to confirm,</LINE>
<LINE>This coronet part betwixt you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Giving the crown</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Royal Lear,</LINE>
<LINE>Whom I have ever honour'd as my king,</LINE>
<LINE>Loved as my father, as my master follow'd,</LINE>
<LINE>As my great patron thought on in my prayers,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The bow is bent and drawn, make from the shaft.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let it fall rather, though the fork invade</LINE>
<LINE>The region of my heart: be Kent unmannerly,</LINE>
<LINE>When Lear is mad. What wilt thou do, old man?</LINE>
<LINE>Think'st thou that duty shall have dread to speak,</LINE>
<LINE>When power to flattery bows? To plainness honour's bound,</LINE>
<LINE>When majesty stoops to folly. Reverse thy doom;</LINE>
<LINE>And, in thy best consideration, cheque</LINE>
<LINE>This hideous rashness: answer my life my judgment,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least;</LINE>
<LINE>Nor are those empty-hearted whose low sound</LINE>
<LINE>Reverbs no hollowness.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Kent, on thy life, no more.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My life I never held but as a pawn</LINE>
<LINE>To wage against thy enemies; nor fear to lose it,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy safety being the motive.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Out of my sight!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>See better, Lear; and let me still remain</LINE>
<LINE>The true blank of thine eye.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, by Apollo,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, by Apollo, king,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou swear'st thy gods in vain.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, vassal! miscreant!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Laying his hand on his sword</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALBANY</SPEAKER>
<SPEAKER>CORNWALL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Dear sir, forbear.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do:</LINE>
<LINE>Kill thy physician, and the fee bestow</LINE>
<LINE>Upon thy foul disease. Revoke thy doom;</LINE>
<LINE>Or, whilst I can vent clamour from my throat,</LINE>
<LINE>I'll tell thee thou dost evil.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hear me, recreant!</LINE>
<LINE>On thine allegiance, hear me!</LINE>
<LINE>Since thou hast sought to make us break our vow,</LINE>
<LINE>Which we durst never yet, and with strain'd pride</LINE>
<LINE>To come between our sentence and our power,</LINE>
<LINE>Which nor our nature nor our place can bear,</LINE>
<LINE>Our potency made good, take thy reward.</LINE>
<LINE>Five days we do allot thee, for provision</LINE>
<LINE>To shield thee from diseases of the world;</LINE>
<LINE>And on the sixth to turn thy hated back</LINE>
<LINE>Upon our kingdom: if, on the tenth day following,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy banish'd trunk be found in our dominions,</LINE>
<LINE>The moment is thy death. Away! by Jupiter,</LINE>
<LINE>This shall not be revoked.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fare thee well, king: sith thus thou wilt appear,</LINE>
<LINE>Freedom lives hence, and banishment is here.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>To CORDELIA</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>The gods to their dear shelter take thee, maid,</LINE>
<LINE>That justly think'st, and hast most rightly said!</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>To REGAN and GONERIL</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>And your large speeches may your deeds approve,</LINE>
<LINE>That good effects may spring from words of love.</LINE>
<LINE>Thus Kent, O princes, bids you all adieu;</LINE>
<LINE>He'll shape his old course in a country new.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>Flourish. Re-enter GLOUCESTER, with KING OF FRANCE,
BURGUNDY, and Attendants</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here's France and Burgundy, my noble lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord of Burgundy.</LINE>
<LINE>We first address towards you, who with this king</LINE>
<LINE>Hath rivall'd for our daughter: what, in the least,</LINE>
<LINE>Will you require in present dower with her,</LINE>
<LINE>Or cease your quest of love?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BURGUNDY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Most royal majesty,</LINE>
<LINE>I crave no more than what your highness offer'd,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor will you tender less.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Right noble Burgundy,</LINE>
<LINE>When she was dear to us, we did hold her so;</LINE>
<LINE>But now her price is fall'n. Sir, there she stands:</LINE>
<LINE>If aught within that little seeming substance,</LINE>
<LINE>Or all of it, with our displeasure pieced,</LINE>
<LINE>And nothing more, may fitly like your grace,</LINE>
<LINE>She's there, and she is yours.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BURGUNDY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know no answer.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Will you, with those infirmities she owes,</LINE>
<LINE>Unfriended, new-adopted to our hate,</LINE>
<LINE>Dower'd with our curse, and stranger'd with our oath,</LINE>
<LINE>Take her, or leave her?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BURGUNDY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pardon me, royal sir;</LINE>
<LINE>Election makes not up on such conditions.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then leave her, sir; for, by the power that made me,</LINE>
<LINE>I tell you all her wealth.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>To KING OF FRANCE</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>For you, great king,</LINE>
<LINE>I would not from your love make such a stray,</LINE>
<LINE>To match you where I hate; therefore beseech you</LINE>
<LINE>To avert your liking a more worthier way</LINE>
<LINE>Than on a wretch whom nature is ashamed</LINE>
<LINE>Almost to acknowledge hers.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING OF FRANCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is most strange,</LINE>
<LINE>That she, that even but now was your best object,</LINE>
<LINE>The argument of your praise, balm of your age,</LINE>
<LINE>Most best, most dearest, should in this trice of time</LINE>
<LINE>Commit a thing so monstrous, to dismantle</LINE>
<LINE>So many folds of favour. Sure, her offence</LINE>
<LINE>Must be of such unnatural degree,</LINE>
<LINE>That monsters it, or your fore-vouch'd affection</LINE>
<LINE>Fall'n into taint: which to believe of her,</LINE>
<LINE>Must be a faith that reason without miracle</LINE>
<LINE>Could never plant in me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORDELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I yet beseech your majesty,--</LINE>
<LINE>If for I want that glib and oily art,</LINE>
<LINE>To speak and purpose not; since what I well intend,</LINE>
<LINE>I'll do't before I speak,--that you make known</LINE>
<LINE>It is no vicious blot, murder, or foulness,</LINE>
<LINE>No unchaste action, or dishonour'd step,</LINE>
<LINE>That hath deprived me of your grace and favour;</LINE>
<LINE>But even for want of that for which I am richer,</LINE>
<LINE>A still-soliciting eye, and such a tongue</LINE>
<LINE>As I am glad I have not, though not to have it</LINE>
<LINE>Hath lost me in your liking.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Better thou</LINE>
<LINE>Hadst not been born than not to have pleased me better.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING OF FRANCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is it but this,--a tardiness in nature</LINE>
<LINE>Which often leaves the history unspoke</LINE>
<LINE>That it intends to do? My lord of Burgundy,</LINE>
<LINE>What say you to the lady? Love's not love</LINE>
<LINE>When it is mingled with regards that stand</LINE>
<LINE>Aloof from the entire point. Will you have her?</LINE>
<LINE>She is herself a dowry.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BURGUNDY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Royal Lear,</LINE>
<LINE>Give but that portion which yourself proposed,</LINE>
<LINE>And here I take Cordelia by the hand,</LINE>
<LINE>Duchess of Burgundy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nothing: I have sworn; I am firm.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BURGUNDY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am sorry, then, you have so lost a father</LINE>
<LINE>That you must lose a husband.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORDELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Peace be with Burgundy!</LINE>
<LINE>Since that respects of fortune are his love,</LINE>
<LINE>I shall not be his wife.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING OF FRANCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fairest Cordelia, that art most rich, being poor;</LINE>
<LINE>Most choice, forsaken; and most loved, despised!</LINE>
<LINE>Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon:</LINE>
<LINE>Be it lawful I take up what's cast away.</LINE>
<LINE>Gods, gods! 'tis strange that from their cold'st neglect</LINE>
<LINE>My love should kindle to inflamed respect.</LINE>
<LINE>Thy dowerless daughter, king, thrown to my chance,</LINE>
<LINE>Is queen of us, of ours, and our fair France:</LINE>
<LINE>Not all the dukes of waterish Burgundy</LINE>
<LINE>Can buy this unprized precious maid of me.</LINE>
<LINE>Bid them farewell, Cordelia, though unkind:</LINE>
<LINE>Thou losest here, a better where to find.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou hast her, France: let her be thine; for we</LINE>
<LINE>Have no such daughter, nor shall ever see</LINE>
<LINE>That face of hers again. Therefore be gone</LINE>
<LINE>Without our grace, our love, our benison.</LINE>
<LINE>Come, noble Burgundy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Flourish. Exeunt all but KING OF FRANCE, GONERIL,
REGAN, and CORDELIA</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING OF FRANCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Bid farewell to your sisters.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORDELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The jewels of our father, with wash'd eyes</LINE>
<LINE>Cordelia leaves you: I know you what you are;</LINE>
<LINE>And like a sister am most loath to call</LINE>
<LINE>Your faults as they are named. Use well our father:</LINE>
<LINE>To your professed bosoms I commit him</LINE>
<LINE>But yet, alas, stood I within his grace,</LINE>
<LINE>I would prefer him to a better place.</LINE>
<LINE>So, farewell to you both.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REGAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Prescribe not us our duties.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GONERIL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let your study</LINE>
<LINE>Be to content your lord, who hath received you</LINE>
<LINE>At fortune's alms. You have obedience scanted,</LINE>
<LINE>And well are worth the want that you have wanted.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORDELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Time shall unfold what plaited cunning hides:</LINE>
<LINE>Who cover faults, at last shame them derides.</LINE>
<LINE>Well may you prosper!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING OF FRANCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, my fair Cordelia.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt KING OF FRANCE and CORDELIA</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GONERIL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sister, it is not a little I have to say of what</LINE>
<LINE>most nearly appertains to us both. I think our</LINE>
<LINE>father will hence to-night.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REGAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That's most certain, and with you; next month with us.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GONERIL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You see how full of changes his age is; the</LINE>
<LINE>observation we have made of it hath not been</LINE>
<LINE>little: he always loved our sister most; and</LINE>
<LINE>with what poor judgment he hath now cast her off</LINE>
<LINE>appears too grossly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>'Tis the infirmity of his age: yet he hath ever</LINE>
<LINE>but slenderly known himself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GONERIL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The best and soundest of his time hath been but</LINE>
<LINE>rash; then must we look to receive from his age,</LINE>
<LINE>not alone the imperfections of long-engraffed</LINE>
<LINE>condition, but therewithal the unruly waywardness</LINE>
<LINE>that infirm and choleric years bring with them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REGAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Such unconstant starts are we like to have from</LINE>
<LINE>him as this of Kent's banishment.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GONERIL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There is further compliment of leavetaking</LINE>
<LINE>between France and him. Pray you, let's hit</LINE>

<LINE>such dispositions as he bears, this last</LINE>
<LINE>surrender of his will but offend us.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REGAN</SPEAKER>

<STAGEDIR>Enter EDMUND, with a letter</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDMUND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou, nature, art my goddess; to thy law</LINE>
<LINE>My services are bound. Wherefore should I</LINE>
<LINE>Stand in the plague of custom, and permit</LINE>
<LINE>The curiosity of nations to deprive me,</LINE>
<LINE>For that I am some twelve or fourteen moon-shines</LINE>
<LINE>Lag of a brother? Why bastard? wherefore base?</LINE>
<LINE>When my dimensions are as well compact,</LINE>
<LINE>My mind as generous, and my shape as true,</LINE>
<LINE>As honest madam's issue? Why brand they us</LINE>
<LINE>With base? with baseness? bastardy? base, base?</LINE>
<LINE>Who, in the lusty stealth of nature, take</LINE>
<LINE>More composition and fierce quality</LINE>
<LINE>Than doth, within a dull, stale, tired bed,</LINE>
<LINE>Go to the creating a whole tribe of fops,</LINE>
<LINE>Got 'tween asleep and wake? Well, then,</LINE>
<LINE>Legitimate Edgar, I must have your land:</LINE>
<LINE>Our father's love is to the bastard Edmund</LINE>
<LINE>As to the legitimate: fine word,--legitimate!</LINE>
<LINE>Well, my legitimate, if this letter speed,</LINE>
<LINE>And my invention thrive, Edmund the base</LINE>
<LINE>Shall top the legitimate. I grow; I prosper:</LINE>
<LINE>Now, gods, stand up for bastards!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter GLOUCESTER</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Kent banish'd thus! and France in choler parted!</LINE>
<LINE>And the king gone to-night! subscribed his power!</LINE>
<LINE>Confined to exhibition! All this done</LINE>
<LINE>Upon the gad! Edmund, how now! what news?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDMUND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So please your lordship, none.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Putting up the letter</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why so earnestly seek you to put up that letter?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDMUND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know no news, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What paper were you reading?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDMUND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nothing, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No? What needed, then, that terrible dispatch of</LINE>
<LINE>it into your pocket? the quality of nothing hath</LINE>
<LINE>not such need to hide itself. Let's see: come,</LINE>
<LINE>if it be nothing, I shall not need spectacles.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDMUND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I beseech you, sir, pardon me: it is a letter</LINE>
<LINE>from my brother, that I have not all o'er-read;</LINE>
<LINE>and for so much as I have perused, I find it not</LINE>
<LINE>fit for your o'er-looking.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Give me the letter, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDMUND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I shall offend, either to detain or give it. The</LINE>
<LINE>contents, as in part I understand them, are to blame.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let's see, let's see.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDMUND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I hope, for my brother's justification, he wrote</LINE>
<LINE>this but as an essay or taste of my virtue.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Reads</STAGEDIR>  'This policy and reverence of age makes</LINE>
<LINE>the world bitter to the best of our times; keeps</LINE>
<LINE>our fortunes from us till our oldness cannot relish</LINE>
<LINE>them. I begin to find an idle and fond bondage</LINE>
<LINE>in the oppression of aged tyranny; who sways, not</LINE>
<LINE>as it hath power, but as it is suffered. Come to</LINE>
<LINE>me, that of this I may speak more. If our father</LINE>
<LINE>would sleep till I waked him, you should half his</LINE>
<LINE>revenue for ever, and live the beloved of your</LINE>
<LINE>brother, EDGAR.'</LINE>
<LINE>Hum--conspiracy!--'Sleep till I waked him,--you</LINE>
<LINE>should enjoy half his revenue,'--My son Edgar!</LINE>
<LINE>Had he a hand to write this? a heart and brain</LINE>
<LINE>to breed it in?--When came this to you? who</LINE>
<LINE>brought it?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDMUND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It was not brought me, my lord; there's the</LINE>
<LINE>cunning of it; I found it thrown in at the</LINE>
<LINE>casement of my closet.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You know the character to be your brother's?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDMUND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If the matter were good, my lord, I durst swear</LINE>
<LINE>it were his; but, in respect of that, I would</LINE>
<LINE>fain think it were not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is his.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDMUND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is his hand, my lord; but I hope his heart is</LINE>
<LINE>not in the contents.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hath he never heretofore sounded you in this business?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDMUND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Never, my lord: but I have heard him oft</LINE>
<LINE>maintain it to be fit, that, sons at perfect age,</LINE>
<LINE>and fathers declining, the father should be as</LINE>
<LINE>ward to the son, and the son manage his revenue.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O villain, villain! His very opinion in the</LINE>
<LINE>letter! Abhorred villain! Unnatural, detested,</LINE>
<LINE>brutish villain! worse than brutish! Go, sirrah,</LINE>
<LINE>seek him; I'll apprehend him: abominable villain!</LINE>
<LINE>Where is he?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDMUND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do not well know, my lord. If it shall please</LINE>
<LINE>you to suspend your indignation against my</LINE>
<LINE>brother till you can derive from him better</LINE>
<LINE>testimony of his intent, you shall run a certain</LINE>
<LINE>course; where, if you violently proceed against</LINE>
<LINE>him, mistaking his purpose, it would make a great</LINE>
<LINE>gap in your own honour, and shake in pieces the</LINE>
<LINE>heart of his obedience. I dare pawn down my life</LINE>
<LINE>for him, that he hath wrote this to feel my</LINE>
<LINE>affection to your honour, and to no further</LINE>
<LINE>pretence of danger.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Think you so?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDMUND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If your honour judge it meet, I will place you</LINE>
<LINE>where you shall hear us confer of this, and by an</LINE>
<LINE>auricular assurance have your satisfaction; and</LINE>
<LINE>that without any further delay than this very evening.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He cannot be such a monster--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDMUND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nor is not, sure.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To his father, that so tenderly and entirely</LINE>
<LINE>loves him. Heaven and earth! Edmund, seek him</LINE>
<LINE>out: wind me into him, I pray you: frame the</LINE>
<LINE>business after your own wisdom. I would unstate</LINE>
<LINE>myself, to be in a due resolution.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDMUND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will seek him, sir, presently: convey the</LINE>
<LINE>business as I shall find means and acquaint you withal.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend</LINE>
<LINE>no good to us: though the wisdom of nature can</LINE>
<LINE>reason it thus and thus, yet nature finds itself</LINE>
<LINE>scourged by the sequent effects: love cools,</LINE>
<LINE>friendship falls off, brothers divide: in</LINE>
<LINE>cities, mutinies; in countries, discord; in</LINE>
<LINE>palaces, treason; and the bond cracked 'twixt son</LINE>
<LINE>and father. This villain of mine comes under the</LINE>
<LINE>prediction; there's son against father: the king</LINE>
<LINE>falls from bias of nature; there's father against</LINE>
<LINE>child. We have seen the best of our time:</LINE>
<LINE>machinations, hollowness, treachery, and all</LINE>
<LINE>ruinous disorders, follow us disquietly to our</LINE>
<LINE>graves. Find out this villain, Edmund; it shall</LINE>
<LINE>lose thee nothing; do it carefully. And the</LINE>
<LINE>noble and true-hearted Kent banished! his</LINE>
<LINE>offence, honesty! 'Tis strange.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDMUND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is the excellent foppery of the world, that,</LINE>
<LINE>when we are sick in fortune,--often the surfeit</LINE>
<LINE>of our own behavior,--we make guilty of our</LINE>
<LINE>disasters the sun, the moon, and the stars: as</LINE>
<LINE>if we were villains by necessity; fools by</LINE>
<LINE>heavenly compulsion; knaves, thieves, and</LINE>
<LINE>treachers, by spherical predominance; drunkards,</LINE>
<LINE>liars, and adulterers, by an enforced obedience of</LINE>
<LINE>planetary influence; and all that we are evil in,</LINE>
<LINE>by a divine thrusting on: an admirable evasion</LINE>
<LINE>of whoremaster man, to lay his goatish</LINE>
<LINE>disposition to the charge of a star! My</LINE>
<LINE>father compounded with my mother under the</LINE>
<LINE>dragon's tail; and my nativity was under Ursa</LINE>
<LINE>major; so that it follows, I am rough and</LINE>
<LINE>lecherous. Tut, I should have been that I am,</LINE>
<LINE>had the maidenliest star in the firmament</LINE>
<LINE>twinkled on my bastardizing. Edgar--</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter EDGAR</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>And pat he comes like the catastrophe of the old</LINE>
<LINE>comedy: my cue is villanous melancholy, with a</LINE>
<LINE>sigh like Tom o' Bedlam. O, these eclipses do</LINE>
<LINE>portend these divisions! fa, sol, la, mi.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDGAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How now, brother Edmund! what serious</LINE>
<LINE>contemplation are you in?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDMUND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am thinking, brother, of a prediction I read</LINE>
<LINE>this other day, what should follow these eclipses.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDGAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do you busy yourself about that?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDMUND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I promise you, the effects he writes of succeed</LINE>
<LINE>unhappily; as of unnaturalness between the child</LINE>
<LINE>and the parent; death, dearth, dissolutions of</LINE>
<LINE>ancient amities; divisions in state, menaces and</LINE>
<LINE>maledictions against king and nobles; needless</LINE>
<LINE>diffidences, banishment of friends, dissipation</LINE>
<LINE>of cohorts, nuptial breaches, and I know not what.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDGAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, two hours together.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDMUND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Parted you in good terms? Found you no</LINE>
<LINE>displeasure in him by word or countenance?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDGAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>None at all.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDMUND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Bethink yourself wherein you may have offended</LINE>
<LINE>him: and at my entreaty forbear his presence</LINE>
<LINE>till some little time hath qualified the heat of</LINE>
<LINE>his displeasure; which at this instant so rageth</LINE>
<LINE>in him, that with the mischief of your person it</LINE>
<LINE>would scarcely allay.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDGAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Some villain hath done me wrong.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDMUND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That's my fear. I pray you, have a continent</LINE>
<LINE>forbearance till the spied of his rage goes</LINE>
<LINE>slower; and, as I say, retire with me to my</LINE>
<LINE>lodging, from whence I will fitly bring you to</LINE>
<LINE>hear my lord speak: pray ye, go; there's my key:</LINE>
<LINE>if you do stir abroad, go armed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDGAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Armed, brother!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDMUND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Brother, I advise you to the best; go armed: I</LINE>
<LINE>am no honest man if there be any good meaning</LINE>
<LINE>towards you: I have told you what I have seen</LINE>
<LINE>and heard; but faintly, nothing like the image</LINE>
<LINE>and horror of it: pray you, away.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDGAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Shall I hear from you anon?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDMUND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do serve you in this business.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit EDGAR</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>A credulous father! and a brother noble,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose nature is so far from doing harms,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GONERIL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By day and night he wrongs me; every hour</LINE>
<LINE>He flashes into one gross crime or other,</LINE>
<LINE>That sets us all at odds: I'll not endure it:</LINE>
<LINE>His knights grow riotous, and himself upbraids us</LINE>
<LINE>On every trifle. When he returns from hunting,</LINE>
<LINE>I will not speak with him; say I am sick:</LINE>
<LINE>If you come slack of former services,</LINE>
<LINE>You shall do well; the fault of it I'll answer.</LINE>

<LINE>Whose mind and mine, I know, in that are one,</LINE>
<LINE>Not to be over-ruled. Idle old man,</LINE>
<LINE>That still would manage those authorities</LINE>
<LINE>That he hath given away! Now, by my life,</LINE>

<LINE>What dost thou profess? what wouldst thou with us?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do profess to be no less than I seem; to serve</LINE>
<LINE>him truly that will put me in trust: to love him</LINE>
<LINE>that is honest; to converse with him that is wise,</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What art thou?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I can keep honest counsel, ride, run, mar a curious</LINE>

<LINE>My lord, I know not what the matter is; but, to my</LINE>

<LINE>Thou but rememberest me of mine own conception: I</LINE>

<LINE>both parts, thou borest thy ass on thy back o'er</LINE>
<LINE>the dirt: thou hadst little wit in thy bald crown,</LINE>
<LINE>when thou gavest thy golden one away. If I speak</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Singing</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Then they for sudden joy did weep,</LINE>
<LINE>And I for sorrow sung,</LINE>

<LINE>whipped for holding my peace. I had rather be any</LINE>
<LINE>kind o' thing than a fool: and yet I would not be</LINE>
<LINE>thee, nuncle; thou hast pared thy wit o' both sides,</LINE>

<LINE>Yes, forsooth, I will hold my tongue; so your face</LINE>

<LINE>But other of your insolent retinue</LINE>
<LINE>Do hourly carp and quarrel; breaking forth</LINE>
<LINE>In rank and not-to-be endured riots. Sir,</LINE>
<LINE>I had thought, by making this well known unto you,</LINE>
<LINE>To have found a safe redress; but now grow fearful,</LINE>
<LINE>By what yourself too late have spoke and done.</LINE>
<LINE>That you protect this course, and put it on</LINE>
<LINE>By your allowance; which if you should, the fault</LINE>
<LINE>Would not 'scape censure, nor the redresses sleep,</LINE>
<LINE>Which, in the tender of a wholesome weal,</LINE>
<LINE>Might in their working do you that offence,</LINE>
<LINE>Which else were shame, that then necessity</LINE>
<LINE>Will call discreet proceeding.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Fool</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For, you trow, nuncle,</LINE>
<LINE>The hedge-sparrow fed the cuckoo so long,</LINE>
<LINE>That it's had it head bit off by it young.</LINE>
<LINE>So, out went the candle, and we were left darkling.</LINE>

<LINE>Doth any here know me? This is not Lear:</LINE>

<LINE>Here do you keep a hundred knights and squires;</LINE>
<LINE>Men so disorder'd, so debosh'd and bold,</LINE>
<LINE>That this our court, infected with their manners,</LINE>
<LINE>Shows like a riotous inn: epicurism and lust</LINE>
<LINE>Make it more like a tavern or a brothel</LINE>
<LINE>Than a graced palace. The shame itself doth speak</LINE>
<LINE>For instant remedy: be then desired</LINE>
<LINE>By her, that else will take the thing she begs,</LINE>
<LINE>A little to disquantity your train;</LINE>
<LINE>And the remainder, that shall still depend,</LINE>

<LINE>How ugly didst thou in Cordelia show!</LINE>
<LINE>That, like an engine, wrench'd my frame of nature</LINE>
<LINE>From the fix'd place; drew from heart all love,</LINE>

<LINE>Into her womb convey sterility!</LINE>
<LINE>Dry up in her the organs of increase;</LINE>

<LINE>Let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth;</LINE>
<LINE>With cadent tears fret channels in her cheeks;</LINE>
<LINE>Turn all her mother's pains and benefits</LINE>

<LINE>Pierce every sense about thee! Old fond eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>Beweep this cause again, I'll pluck ye out,</LINE>
<LINE>And cast you, with the waters that you lose,</LINE>
<LINE>To temper clay. Yea, it is come to this?</LINE>
<LINE>Let is be so: yet have I left a daughter,</LINE>
<LINE>Who, I am sure, is kind and comfortable:</LINE>
<LINE>When she shall hear this of thee, with her nails</LINE>
<LINE>She'll flay thy wolvish visage. Thou shalt find</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDMUND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Save thee, Curan.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CURAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And you, sir. I have been with your father, and</LINE>
<LINE>given him notice that the Duke of Cornwall and Regan</LINE>
<LINE>his duchess will be here with him this night.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDMUND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How comes that?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CURAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, I know not. You have heard of the news abroad;</LINE>
<LINE>I mean the whispered ones, for they are yet but</LINE>
<LINE>ear-kissing arguments?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDMUND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not I pray you, what are they?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CURAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Have you heard of no likely wars toward, 'twixt the</LINE>
<LINE>Dukes of Cornwall and Albany?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDMUND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not a word.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CURAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You may do, then, in time. Fare you well, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDMUND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The duke be here to-night? The better! best!</LINE>
<LINE>This weaves itself perforce into my business.</LINE>
<LINE>My father hath set guard to take my brother;</LINE>
<LINE>And I have one thing, of a queasy question,</LINE>
<LINE>Which I must act: briefness and fortune, work!</LINE>
<LINE>Brother, a word; descend: brother, I say!</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter EDGAR</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>My father watches: O sir, fly this place;</LINE>
<LINE>Intelligence is given where you are hid;</LINE>
<LINE>You have now the good advantage of the night:</LINE>
<LINE>Have you not spoken 'gainst the Duke of Cornwall?</LINE>
<LINE>He's coming hither: now, i' the night, i' the haste,</LINE>
<LINE>And Regan with him: have you nothing said</LINE>
<LINE>Upon his party 'gainst the Duke of Albany?</LINE>
<LINE>Advise yourself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDGAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am sure on't, not a word.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDMUND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I hear my father coming: pardon me:</LINE>
<LINE>In cunning I must draw my sword upon you</LINE>
<LINE>Draw; seem to defend yourself; now quit you well.</LINE>
<LINE>Yield: come before my father. Light, ho, here!</LINE>
<LINE>Fly, brother. Torches, torches! So, farewell.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit EDGAR</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Some blood drawn on me would beget opinion.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Wounds his arm</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Of my more fierce endeavour: I have seen drunkards</LINE>
<LINE>Do more than this in sport. Father, father!</LINE>
<LINE>Stop, stop! No help?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter GLOUCESTER, and Servants with torches</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, Edmund, where's the villain?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDMUND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here stood he in the dark, his sharp sword out,</LINE>
<LINE>Mumbling of wicked charms, conjuring the moon</LINE>
<LINE>To stand auspicious mistress,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But where is he?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDMUND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Look, sir, I bleed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where is the villain, Edmund?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDMUND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fled this way, sir. When by no means he could--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pursue him, ho! Go after.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exeunt some Servants</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>By no means what?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDMUND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Persuade me to the murder of your lordship;</LINE>
<LINE>But that I told him, the revenging gods</LINE>
<LINE>'Gainst parricides did all their thunders bend;</LINE>
<LINE>Spoke, with how manifold and strong a bond</LINE>
<LINE>The child was bound to the father; sir, in fine,</LINE>
<LINE>Seeing how loathly opposite I stood</LINE>
<LINE>To his unnatural purpose, in fell motion,</LINE>
<LINE>With his prepared sword, he charges home</LINE>
<LINE>My unprovided body, lanced mine arm:</LINE>
<LINE>But when he saw my best alarum'd spirits,</LINE>
<LINE>Bold in the quarrel's right, roused to the encounter,</LINE>
<LINE>Or whether gasted by the noise I made,</LINE>
<LINE>Full suddenly he fled.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let him fly far:</LINE>
<LINE>Not in this land shall he remain uncaught;</LINE>
<LINE>And found--dispatch. The noble duke my master,</LINE>
<LINE>My worthy arch and patron, comes to-night:</LINE>
<LINE>By his authority I will proclaim it,</LINE>
<LINE>That he which finds him shall deserve our thanks,</LINE>
<LINE>Bringing the murderous coward to the stake;</LINE>
<LINE>He that conceals him, death.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDMUND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>When I dissuaded him from his intent,</LINE>
<LINE>And found him pight to do it, with curst speech</LINE>
<LINE>I threaten'd to discover him: he replied,</LINE>
<LINE>'Thou unpossessing bastard! dost thou think,</LINE>
<LINE>If I would stand against thee, would the reposal</LINE>
<LINE>Of any trust, virtue, or worth in thee</LINE>
<LINE>Make thy words faith'd? No: what I should deny,--</LINE>
<LINE>As this I would: ay, though thou didst produce</LINE>
<LINE>My very character,--I'ld turn it all</LINE>
<LINE>To thy suggestion, plot, and damned practise:</LINE>
<LINE>And thou must make a dullard of the world,</LINE>
<LINE>If they not thought the profits of my death</LINE>
<LINE>Were very pregnant and potential spurs</LINE>
<LINE>To make thee seek it.'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Strong and fasten'd villain</LINE>
<LINE>Would he deny his letter? I never got him.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Tucket within</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Hark, the duke's trumpets! I know not why he comes.</LINE>
<LINE>All ports I'll bar; the villain shall not 'scape;</LINE>
<LINE>The duke must grant me that: besides, his picture</LINE>
<LINE>I will send far and near, that all the kingdom</LINE>
<LINE>May have the due note of him; and of my land,</LINE>
<LINE>Loyal and natural boy, I'll work the means</LINE>
<LINE>To make thee capable.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter CORNWALL, REGAN, and Attendants</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORNWALL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How now, my noble friend! since I came hither,</LINE>
<LINE>Which I can call but now, I have heard strange news.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REGAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If it be true, all vengeance comes too short</LINE>
<LINE>Which can pursue the offender. How dost, my lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, madam, my old heart is crack'd, it's crack'd!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REGAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, did my father's godson seek your life?</LINE>
<LINE>He whom my father named? your Edgar?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, lady, lady, shame would have it hid!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REGAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Was he not companion with the riotous knights</LINE>
<LINE>That tend upon my father?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know not, madam: 'tis too bad, too bad.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDMUND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, madam, he was of that consort.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REGAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No marvel, then, though he were ill affected:</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis they have put him on the old man's death,</LINE>
<LINE>To have the expense and waste of his revenues.</LINE>
<LINE>I have this present evening from my sister</LINE>
<LINE>Been well inform'd of them; and with such cautions,</LINE>
<LINE>That if they come to sojourn at my house,</LINE>
<LINE>I'll not be there.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORNWALL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nor I, assure thee, Regan.</LINE>
<LINE>Edmund, I hear that you have shown your father</LINE>
<LINE>A child-like office.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDMUND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Twas my duty, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He did bewray his practise; and received</LINE>
<LINE>This hurt you see, striving to apprehend him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORNWALL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is he pursued?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, my good lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORNWALL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If he be taken, he shall never more</LINE>
<LINE>Be fear'd of doing harm: make your own purpose,</LINE>
<LINE>How in my strength you please. For you, Edmund,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose virtue and obedience doth this instant</LINE>
<LINE>So much commend itself, you shall be ours:</LINE>
<LINE>Natures of such deep trust we shall much need;</LINE>
<LINE>You we first seize on.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDMUND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I shall serve you, sir,</LINE>
<LINE>Truly, however else.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For him I thank your grace.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORNWALL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You know not why we came to visit you,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REGAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thus out of season, threading dark-eyed night:</LINE>
<LINE>Occasions, noble Gloucester, of some poise,</LINE>
<LINE>Wherein we must have use of your advice:</LINE>
<LINE>Our father he hath writ, so hath our sister,</LINE>
<LINE>Of differences, which I least thought it fit</LINE>
<LINE>To answer from our home; the several messengers</LINE>
<LINE>From hence attend dispatch. Our good old friend,</LINE>
<LINE>Lay comforts to your bosom; and bestow</LINE>
<LINE>Your needful counsel to our business,</LINE>
<LINE>Which craves the instant use.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I serve you, madam:</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OSWALD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good dawning to thee, friend: art of this house?</LINE>

<LINE>Ay.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OSWALD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Prithee, if thou lovest me, tell me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I love thee not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OSWALD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, then, I care not for thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If I had thee in Lipsbury pinfold, I would make thee</LINE>
<LINE>care for me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OSWALD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why dost thou use me thus? I know thee not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fellow, I know thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OSWALD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What dost thou know me for?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A knave; a rascal; an eater of broken meats; a</LINE>
<LINE>base, proud, shallow, beggarly, three-suited,</LINE>
<LINE>hundred-pound, filthy, worsted-stocking knave; a</LINE>
<LINE>lily-livered, action-taking knave, a whoreson,</LINE>
<LINE>glass-gazing, super-serviceable finical rogue;</LINE>
<LINE>one-trunk-inheriting slave; one that wouldst be a</LINE>
<LINE>bawd, in way of good service, and art nothing but</LINE>
<LINE>the composition of a knave, beggar, coward, pandar,</LINE>
<LINE>and the son and heir of a mongrel bitch: one whom I</LINE>
<LINE>will beat into clamorous whining, if thou deniest</LINE>
<LINE>the least syllable of thy addition.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OSWALD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, what a monstrous fellow art thou, thus to rail</LINE>
<LINE>on one that is neither known of thee nor knows thee!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What a brazen-faced varlet art thou, to deny thou</LINE>
<LINE>knowest me! Is it two days ago since I tripped up</LINE>
<LINE>thy heels, and beat thee before the king? Draw, you</LINE>
<LINE>rogue: for, though it be night, yet the moon</LINE>
<LINE>shines; I'll make a sop o' the moonshine of you:</LINE>
<LINE>draw, you whoreson cullionly barber-monger, draw.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Drawing his sword</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OSWALD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Away! I have nothing to do with thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Draw, you rascal: you come with letters against the</LINE>
<LINE>king; and take vanity the puppet's part against the</LINE>
<LINE>royalty of her father: draw, you rogue, or I'll so</LINE>
<LINE>carbonado your shanks: draw, you rascal; come your ways.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>Help, ho! murder! murder!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter EDMUND, with his rapier drawn, CORNWALL,
REGAN, GLOUCESTER, and Servants</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDMUND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How now! What's the matter?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With you, goodman boy, an you please: come, I'll</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORNWALL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Keep peace, upon your lives:</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REGAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The messengers from our sister and the king.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORNWALL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What is your difference? speak.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OSWALD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am scarce in breath, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No marvel, you have so bestirred your valour. You</LINE>
<LINE>cowardly rascal, nature disclaims in thee: a</LINE>
<LINE>tailor made thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORNWALL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou art a strange fellow: a tailor make a man?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, a tailor, sir: a stone-cutter or painter could</LINE>
<LINE>not have made him so ill, though he had been but two</LINE>
<LINE>hours at the trade.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORNWALL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Speak yet, how grew your quarrel?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OSWALD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This ancient ruffian, sir, whose life I have spared</LINE>
<LINE>at suit of his gray beard,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou whoreson zed! thou unnecessary letter! My</LINE>
<LINE>lord, if you will give me leave, I will tread this</LINE>
<LINE>unbolted villain into mortar, and daub the wall of</LINE>
<LINE>a jakes with him. Spare my gray beard, you wagtail?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORNWALL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Peace, sirrah!</LINE>
<LINE>You beastly knave, know you no reverence?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, sir; but anger hath a privilege.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORNWALL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why art thou angry?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That such a slave as this should wear a sword,</LINE>
<LINE>Who wears no honesty. Such smiling rogues as these,</LINE>
<LINE>Like rats, oft bite the holy cords a-twain</LINE>
<LINE>Which are too intrinse t' unloose; smooth every passion</LINE>
<LINE>That in the natures of their lords rebel;</LINE>
<LINE>Bring oil to fire, snow to their colder moods;</LINE>
<LINE>Renege, affirm, and turn their halcyon beaks</LINE>
<LINE>With every gale and vary of their masters,</LINE>
<LINE>Knowing nought, like dogs, but following.</LINE>
<LINE>A plague upon your epileptic visage!</LINE>
<LINE>Smile you my speeches, as I were a fool?</LINE>
<LINE>Goose, if I had you upon Sarum plain,</LINE>
<LINE>I'ld drive ye cackling home to Camelot.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORNWALL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, art thou mad, old fellow?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How fell you out? say that.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No contraries hold more antipathy</LINE>
<LINE>Than I and such a knave.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORNWALL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why dost thou call him a knave?  What's his offence?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>His countenance likes me not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORNWALL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No more, perchance, does mine, nor his, nor hers.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, 'tis my occupation to be plain:</LINE>
<LINE>I have seen better faces in my time</LINE>
<LINE>Than stands on any shoulder that I see</LINE>
<LINE>Before me at this instant.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORNWALL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is some fellow,</LINE>
<LINE>Who, having been praised for bluntness, doth affect</LINE>
<LINE>A saucy roughness, and constrains the garb</LINE>
<LINE>Quite from his nature: he cannot flatter, he,</LINE>
<LINE>An honest mind and plain, he must speak truth!</LINE>
<LINE>An they will take it, so; if not, he's plain.</LINE>
<LINE>These kind of knaves I know, which in this plainness</LINE>
<LINE>Harbour more craft and more corrupter ends</LINE>
<LINE>Than twenty silly ducking observants</LINE>
<LINE>That stretch their duties nicely.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, in good sooth, in sincere verity,</LINE>
<LINE>Under the allowance of your great aspect,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose influence, like the wreath of radiant fire</LINE>
<LINE>On flickering Phoebus' front,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORNWALL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What mean'st by this?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To go out of my dialect, which you</LINE>
<LINE>discommend so much. I know, sir, I am no</LINE>
<LINE>flatterer: he that beguiled you in a plain</LINE>
<LINE>accent was a plain knave; which for my part</LINE>
<LINE>I will not be, though I should win your displeasure</LINE>
<LINE>to entreat me to 't.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORNWALL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What was the offence you gave him?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OSWALD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I never gave him any:</LINE>
<LINE>It pleased the king his master very late</LINE>
<LINE>To strike at me, upon his misconstruction;</LINE>
<LINE>When he, conjunct and flattering his displeasure,</LINE>
<LINE>Tripp'd me behind; being down, insulted, rail'd,</LINE>
<LINE>And put upon him such a deal of man,</LINE>
<LINE>That worthied him, got praises of the king</LINE>
<LINE>For him attempting who was self-subdued;</LINE>
<LINE>And, in the fleshment of this dread exploit,</LINE>
<LINE>Drew on me here again.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>None of these rogues and cowards</LINE>
<LINE>But Ajax is their fool.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORNWALL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fetch forth the stocks!</LINE>
<LINE>You stubborn ancient knave, you reverend braggart,</LINE>
<LINE>We'll teach you--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, I am too old to learn:</LINE>
<LINE>Call not your stocks for me: I serve the king;</LINE>
<LINE>On whose employment I was sent to you:</LINE>
<LINE>You shall do small respect, show too bold malice</LINE>
<LINE>Against the grace and person of my master,</LINE>
<LINE>Stocking his messenger.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORNWALL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fetch forth the stocks! As I have life and honour,</LINE>
<LINE>There shall he sit till noon.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REGAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Till noon! till night, my lord; and all night too.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, madam, if I were your father's dog,</LINE>
<LINE>You should not use me so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REGAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, being his knave, I will.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORNWALL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is a fellow of the self-same colour</LINE>
<LINE>Our sister speaks of. Come, bring away the stocks!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Stocks brought out</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let me beseech your grace not to do so:</LINE>
<LINE>His fault is much, and the good king his master</LINE>
<LINE>Will cheque him for 't: your purposed low correction</LINE>
<LINE>Is such as basest and contemned'st wretches</LINE>
<LINE>For pilferings and most common trespasses</LINE>
<LINE>Are punish'd with: the king must take it ill,</LINE>
<LINE>That he's so slightly valued in his messenger,</LINE>
<LINE>Should have him thus restrain'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORNWALL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll answer that.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>My sister may receive it much more worse,</LINE>

<LINE>Come, my good lord, away.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER and KENT</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am sorry for thee, friend; 'tis the duke's pleasure,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose disposition, all the world well knows,</LINE>
<LINE>Will not be rubb'd nor stopp'd: I'll entreat for thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pray, do not, sir: I have watched and travell'd hard;</LINE>
<LINE>Some time I shall sleep out, the rest I'll whistle.</LINE>
<LINE>A good man's fortune may grow out at heels:</LINE>
<LINE>Give you good morrow!</LINE>

<LINE>Good king, that must approve the common saw,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou out of heaven's benediction comest</LINE>
<LINE>To the warm sun!</LINE>
<LINE>Approach, thou beacon to this under globe,</LINE>
<LINE>That by thy comfortable beams I may</LINE>
<LINE>Peruse this letter! Nothing almost sees miracles</LINE>
<LINE>But misery: I know 'tis from Cordelia,</LINE>
<LINE>Who hath most fortunately been inform'd</LINE>
<LINE>Of my obscured course; and shall find time</LINE>
<LINE>From this enormous state, seeking to give</LINE>
<LINE>Losses their remedies. All weary and o'erwatch'd,</LINE>
<LINE>Take vantage, heavy eyes, not to behold</LINE>
<LINE>This shameful lodging.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDGAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I heard myself proclaim'd;</LINE>
<LINE>And by the happy hollow of a tree</LINE>
<LINE>Escaped the hunt. No port is free; no place,</LINE>
<LINE>That guard, and most unusual vigilance,</LINE>
<LINE>Does not attend my taking. Whiles I may 'scape,</LINE>
<LINE>I will preserve myself: and am bethought</LINE>
<LINE>To take the basest and most poorest shape</LINE>
<LINE>That ever penury, in contempt of man,</LINE>
<LINE>Brought near to beast: my face I'll grime with filth;</LINE>
<LINE>Blanket my loins: elf all my hair in knots;</LINE>
<LINE>And with presented nakedness out-face</LINE>
<LINE>The winds and persecutions of the sky.</LINE>
<LINE>The country gives me proof and precedent</LINE>
<LINE>Of Bedlam beggars, who, with roaring voices,</LINE>
<LINE>Strike in their numb'd and mortified bare arms</LINE>
<LINE>Pins, wooden pricks, nails, sprigs of rosemary;</LINE>
<LINE>And with this horrible object, from low farms,</LINE>
<LINE>Poor pelting villages, sheep-cotes, and mills,</LINE>
<LINE>Sometime with lunatic bans, sometime with prayers,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis strange that they should so depart from home,</LINE>
<LINE>And not send back my messenger.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Gentleman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As I learn'd,</LINE>
<LINE>The night before there was no purpose in them</LINE>
<LINE>Of this remove.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hail to thee, noble master!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ha!</LINE>
<LINE>Makest thou this shame thy pastime?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Fool</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ha, ha! he wears cruel garters. Horses are tied</LINE>
<LINE>by the heads, dogs and bears by the neck, monkeys by</LINE>
<LINE>the loins, and men by the legs: when a man's</LINE>
<LINE>over-lusty at legs, then he wears wooden</LINE>
<LINE>nether-stocks.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What's he that hath so much thy place mistook</LINE>
<LINE>To set thee here?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is both he and she;</LINE>
<LINE>Your son and daughter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, I say.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I say, yea.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, no, they would not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, they have.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By Jupiter, I swear, no.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By Juno, I swear, ay.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They durst not do 't;</LINE>
<LINE>They could not, would not do 't; 'tis worse than murder,</LINE>
<LINE>To do upon respect such violent outrage:</LINE>
<LINE>Resolve me, with all modest haste, which way</LINE>
<LINE>Thou mightst deserve, or they impose, this usage,</LINE>
<LINE>Coming from us.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, when at their home</LINE>
<LINE>I did commend your highness' letters to them,</LINE>
<LINE>Ere I was risen from the place that show'd</LINE>
<LINE>My duty kneeling, came there a reeking post,</LINE>
<LINE>Stew'd in his haste, half breathless, panting forth</LINE>
<LINE>From Goneril his mistress salutations;</LINE>
<LINE>Deliver'd letters, spite of intermission,</LINE>
<LINE>Which presently they read: on whose contents,</LINE>
<LINE>They summon'd up their meiny, straight took horse;</LINE>
<LINE>Commanded me to follow, and attend</LINE>
<LINE>The leisure of their answer; gave me cold looks:</LINE>
<LINE>And meeting here the other messenger,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose welcome, I perceived, had poison'd mine,--</LINE>
<LINE>Being the very fellow that of late</LINE>
<LINE>Display'd so saucily against your highness,--</LINE>
<LINE>Having more man than wit about me, drew:</LINE>
<LINE>He raised the house with loud and coward cries.</LINE>
<LINE>Your son and daughter found this trespass worth</LINE>
<LINE>The shame which here it suffers.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Fool</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Winter's not gone yet, if the wild-geese fly that way.</LINE>
<LINE>Fathers that wear rags</LINE>
<LINE>Do make their children blind;</LINE>
<LINE>But fathers that bear bags</LINE>
<LINE>Shall see their children kind.</LINE>
<LINE>Fortune, that arrant whore,</LINE>
<LINE>Ne'er turns the key to the poor.</LINE>
<LINE>But, for all this, thou shalt have as many dolours</LINE>
<LINE>for thy daughters as thou canst tell in a year.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, how this mother swells up toward my heart!</LINE>
<LINE>Hysterica passio, down, thou climbing sorrow,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy element's below! Where is this daughter?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With the earl, sir, here within.</LINE>

<LINE>Stay here.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Gentleman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Made you no more offence but what you speak of?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>None.</LINE>
<LINE>How chance the king comes with so small a train?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Fool</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And thou hadst been set i' the stocks for that</LINE>
<LINE>question, thou hadst well deserved it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, fool?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Fool</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We'll set thee to school to an ant, to teach thee</LINE>
<LINE>there's no labouring i' the winter. All that follow</LINE>
<LINE>their noses are led by their eyes but blind men; and</LINE>
<LINE>there's not a nose among twenty but can smell him</LINE>
<LINE>that's stinking. Let go thy hold when a great wheel</LINE>
<LINE>runs down a hill, lest it break thy neck with</LINE>
<LINE>following it: but the great one that goes up the</LINE>
<LINE>hill, let him draw thee after. When a wise man</LINE>
<LINE>gives thee better counsel, give me mine again: I</LINE>
<LINE>would have none but knaves follow it, since a fool gives it.</LINE>
<LINE>That sir which serves and seeks for gain,</LINE>
<LINE>And follows but for form,</LINE>
<LINE>Will pack when it begins to rain,</LINE>
<LINE>And leave thee in the storm,</LINE>
<LINE>But I will tarry; the fool will stay,</LINE>
<LINE>And let the wise man fly:</LINE>
<LINE>The knave turns fool that runs away;</LINE>
<LINE>The fool no knave, perdy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Re-enter KING LEAR with GLOUCESTER</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Deny to speak with me? They are sick? they are weary?</LINE>
<LINE>They have travell'd all the night? Mere fetches;</LINE>
<LINE>The images of revolt and flying off.</LINE>
<LINE>Fetch me a better answer.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My dear lord,</LINE>
<LINE>You know the fiery quality of the duke;</LINE>
<LINE>How unremoveable and fix'd he is</LINE>
<LINE>In his own course.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Vengeance! plague! death! confusion!</LINE>
<LINE>Fiery? what quality? Why, Gloucester, Gloucester,</LINE>
<LINE>I'ld speak with the Duke of Cornwall and his wife.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, my good lord, I have inform'd them so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Inform'd them! Dost thou understand me, man?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, my good lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The king would speak with Cornwall; the dear father</LINE>
<LINE>Would with his daughter speak, commands her service:</LINE>
<LINE>Are they inform'd of this? My breath and blood!</LINE>
<LINE>Fiery? the fiery duke? Tell the hot duke that--</LINE>
<LINE>No, but not yet: may be he is not well:</LINE>
<LINE>Infirmity doth still neglect all office</LINE>
<LINE>Whereto our health is bound; we are not ourselves</LINE>
<LINE>When nature, being oppress'd, commands the mind</LINE>
<LINE>To suffer with the body: I'll forbear;</LINE>
<LINE>And am fall'n out with my more headier will,</LINE>
<LINE>To take the indisposed and sickly fit</LINE>
<LINE>For the sound man. Death on my state! wherefore</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Looking on KENT</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Should he sit here? This act persuades me</LINE>
<LINE>That this remotion of the duke and her</LINE>
<LINE>Is practise only. Give me my servant forth.</LINE>
<LINE>Go tell the duke and 's wife I'ld speak with them,</LINE>
<LINE>Now, presently: bid them come forth and hear me,</LINE>
<LINE>Or at their chamber-door I'll beat the drum</LINE>
<LINE>Till it cry sleep to death.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>Fool</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Cry to it, nuncle, as the cockney did to the eels</LINE>
<LINE>when she put 'em i' the paste alive; she knapped 'em</LINE>
<LINE>o' the coxcombs with a stick, and cried 'Down,</LINE>
<LINE>wantons, down!' 'Twas her brother that, in pure</LINE>
<LINE>kindness to his horse, buttered his hay.</LINE>

<LINE>Good morrow to you both.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORNWALL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hail to your grace!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>KENT is set at liberty</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REGAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am glad to see your highness.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Regan, I think you are; I know what reason</LINE>
<LINE>I have to think so: if thou shouldst not be glad,</LINE>
<LINE>I would divorce me from thy mother's tomb,</LINE>
<LINE>Sepulchring an adultress.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>To KENT</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>O, are you free?</LINE>
<LINE>Some other time for that. Beloved Regan,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy sister's naught: O Regan, she hath tied</LINE>
<LINE>Sharp-tooth'd unkindness, like a vulture, here:</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Points to his heart</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>I can scarce speak to thee; thou'lt not believe</LINE>
<LINE>With how depraved a quality--O Regan!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REGAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I pray you, sir, take patience: I have hope.</LINE>
<LINE>You less know how to value her desert</LINE>
<LINE>Than she to scant her duty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Say, how is that?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REGAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I cannot think my sister in the least</LINE>
<LINE>Would fail her obligation: if, sir, perchance</LINE>
<LINE>She have restrain'd the riots of your followers,</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis on such ground, and to such wholesome end,</LINE>
<LINE>As clears her from all blame.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My curses on her!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REGAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, sir, you are old.</LINE>
<LINE>Nature in you stands on the very verge</LINE>
<LINE>Of her confine: you should be ruled and led</LINE>
<LINE>By some discretion, that discerns your state</LINE>
<LINE>Better than you yourself. Therefore, I pray you,</LINE>
<LINE>That to our sister you do make return;</LINE>
<LINE>Say you have wrong'd her, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ask her forgiveness?</LINE>
<LINE>Do you but mark how this becomes the house:</LINE>
<LINE>'Dear daughter, I confess that I am old;</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Kneeling</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Age is unnecessary: on my knees I beg</LINE>
<LINE>That you'll vouchsafe me raiment, bed, and food.'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REGAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good sir, no more; these are unsightly tricks:</LINE>
<LINE>Return you to my sister.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Rising</STAGEDIR>  Never, Regan:</LINE>
<LINE>She hath abated me of half my train;</LINE>
<LINE>Look'd black upon me; struck me with her tongue,</LINE>
<LINE>Most serpent-like, upon the very heart:</LINE>
<LINE>All the stored vengeances of heaven fall</LINE>
<LINE>On her ingrateful top! Strike her young bones,</LINE>
<LINE>You taking airs, with lameness!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORNWALL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fie, sir, fie!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You nimble lightnings, dart your blinding flames</LINE>
<LINE>Into her scornful eyes! Infect her beauty,</LINE>
<LINE>You fen-suck'd fogs, drawn by the powerful sun,</LINE>
<LINE>To fall and blast her pride!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REGAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O the blest gods! so will you wish on me,</LINE>
<LINE>When the rash mood is on.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse:</LINE>
<LINE>Thy tender-hefted nature shall not give</LINE>
<LINE>Thee o'er to harshness: her eyes are fierce; but thine</LINE>
<LINE>Do comfort and not burn. 'Tis not in thee</LINE>
<LINE>To grudge my pleasures, to cut off my train,</LINE>
<LINE>To bandy hasty words, to scant my sizes,</LINE>
<LINE>And in conclusion to oppose the bolt</LINE>
<LINE>Against my coming in: thou better know'st</LINE>
<LINE>The offices of nature, bond of childhood,</LINE>
<LINE>Effects of courtesy, dues of gratitude;</LINE>
<LINE>Thy half o' the kingdom hast thou not forgot,</LINE>
<LINE>Wherein I thee endow'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REGAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good sir, to the purpose.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>Who put my man i' the stocks?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Tucket within</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORNWALL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What trumpet's that?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REGAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know't, my sister's: this approves her letter,</LINE>
<LINE>That she would soon be here.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter OSWALD</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Is your lady come?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is a slave, whose easy-borrow'd pride</LINE>
<LINE>Dwells in the fickle grace of her he follows.</LINE>
<LINE>Out, varlet, from my sight!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORNWALL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What means your grace?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who stock'd my servant? Regan, I have good hope</LINE>
<LINE>Thou didst not know on't. Who comes here? O heavens,</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter GONERIL</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>If you do love old men, if your sweet sway</LINE>
<LINE>Allow obedience, if yourselves are old,</LINE>
<LINE>Make it your cause; send down, and take my part!</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>To GONERIL</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Art not ashamed to look upon this beard?</LINE>
<LINE>O Regan, wilt thou take her by the hand?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GONERIL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why not by the hand, sir? How have I offended?</LINE>
<LINE>All's not offence that indiscretion finds</LINE>
<LINE>And dotage terms so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O sides, you are too tough;</LINE>
<LINE>Will you yet hold? How came my man i' the stocks?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORNWALL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I set him there, sir: but his own disorders</LINE>
<LINE>Deserved much less advancement.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You! did you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REGAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I pray you, father, being weak, seem so.</LINE>
<LINE>If, till the expiration of your month,</LINE>
<LINE>You will return and sojourn with my sister,</LINE>
<LINE>Dismissing half your train, come then to me:</LINE>
<LINE>I am now from home, and out of that provision</LINE>
<LINE>Which shall be needful for your entertainment.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Return to her, and fifty men dismiss'd?</LINE>
<LINE>No, rather I abjure all roofs, and choose</LINE>
<LINE>To wage against the enmity o' the air;</LINE>
<LINE>To be a comrade with the wolf and owl,--</LINE>
<LINE>Necessity's sharp pinch! Return with her?</LINE>
<LINE>Why, the hot-blooded France, that dowerless took</LINE>
<LINE>Our youngest born, I could as well be brought</LINE>
<LINE>To knee his throne, and, squire-like; pension beg</LINE>
<LINE>To keep base life afoot. Return with her?</LINE>
<LINE>Persuade me rather to be slave and sumpter</LINE>
<LINE>To this detested groom.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Pointing at OSWALD</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GONERIL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>At your choice, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I prithee, daughter, do not make me mad:</LINE>
<LINE>I will not trouble thee, my child; farewell:</LINE>
<LINE>We'll no more meet, no more see one another:</LINE>
<LINE>But yet thou art my flesh, my blood, my daughter;</LINE>
<LINE>Or rather a disease that's in my flesh,</LINE>
<LINE>Which I must needs call mine: thou art a boil,</LINE>
<LINE>A plague-sore, an embossed carbuncle,</LINE>
<LINE>In my corrupted blood. But I'll not chide thee;</LINE>
<LINE>Let shame come when it will, I do not call it:</LINE>
<LINE>I do not bid the thunder-bearer shoot,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor tell tales of thee to high-judging Jove:</LINE>
<LINE>Mend when thou canst; be better at thy leisure:</LINE>
<LINE>I can be patient; I can stay with Regan,</LINE>
<LINE>I and my hundred knights.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REGAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not altogether so:</LINE>
<LINE>I look'd not for you yet, nor am provided</LINE>
<LINE>For your fit welcome. Give ear, sir, to my sister;</LINE>
<LINE>For those that mingle reason with your passion</LINE>
<LINE>Must be content to think you old, and so--</LINE>
<LINE>But she knows what she does.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is this well spoken?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REGAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I dare avouch it, sir: what, fifty followers?</LINE>
<LINE>Is it not well? What should you need of more?</LINE>
<LINE>Yea, or so many, sith that both charge and danger</LINE>
<LINE>Speak 'gainst so great a number? How, in one house,</LINE>
<LINE>Should many people, under two commands,</LINE>
<LINE>Hold amity? 'Tis hard; almost impossible.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GONERIL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why might not you, my lord, receive attendance</LINE>
<LINE>From those that she calls servants or from mine?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REGAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why not, my lord? If then they chanced to slack you,</LINE>
<LINE>We could control them. If you will come to me,--</LINE>
<LINE>For now I spy a danger,--I entreat you</LINE>
<LINE>To bring but five and twenty: to no more</LINE>
<LINE>Will I give place or notice.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I gave you all--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REGAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And in good time you gave it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Made you my guardians, my depositaries;</LINE>
<LINE>But kept a reservation to be follow'd</LINE>
<LINE>With such a number. What, must I come to you</LINE>
<LINE>With five and twenty, Regan? said you so?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REGAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And speak't again, my lord; no more with me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Those wicked creatures yet do look well-favour'd,</LINE>
<LINE>When others are more wicked: not being the worst</LINE>
<LINE>Stands in some rank of praise.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>To GONERIL</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>I'll go with thee:</LINE>
<LINE>Thy fifty yet doth double five and twenty,</LINE>
<LINE>And thou art twice her love.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GONERIL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hear me, my lord;</LINE>
<LINE>What need you five and twenty, ten, or five,</LINE>
<LINE>To follow in a house where twice so many</LINE>
<LINE>Have a command to tend you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REGAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What need one?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, reason not the need: our basest beggars</LINE>
<LINE>Are in the poorest thing superfluous:</LINE>
<LINE>Allow not nature more than nature needs,</LINE>
<LINE>Man's life's as cheap as beast's: thou art a lady;</LINE>
<LINE>If only to go warm were gorgeous,</LINE>
<LINE>Why, nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear'st,</LINE>
<LINE>Which scarcely keeps thee warm. But, for true need,--</LINE>
<LINE>You heavens, give me that patience, patience I need!</LINE>
<LINE>You see me here, you gods, a poor old man,</LINE>
<LINE>As full of grief as age; wretched in both!</LINE>
<LINE>If it be you that stir these daughters' hearts</LINE>
<LINE>Against their father, fool me not so much</LINE>
<LINE>To bear it tamely; touch me with noble anger,</LINE>
<LINE>And let not women's weapons, water-drops,</LINE>
<LINE>Stain my man's cheeks! No, you unnatural hags,</LINE>
<LINE>I will have such revenges on you both,</LINE>
<LINE>That all the world shall--I will do such things,--</LINE>
<LINE>What they are, yet I know not: but they shall be</LINE>
<LINE>The terrors of the earth. You think I'll weep</LINE>
<LINE>No, I'll not weep:</LINE>
<LINE>I have full cause of weeping; but this heart</LINE>
<LINE>Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws,</LINE>
<LINE>Or ere I'll weep. O fool, I shall go mad!</LINE>

<SPEAKER>CORNWALL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let us withdraw; 'twill be a storm.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REGAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This house is little: the old man and his people</LINE>
<LINE>Cannot be well bestow'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GONERIL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis his own blame; hath put himself from rest,</LINE>
<LINE>And must needs taste his folly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REGAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For his particular, I'll receive him gladly,</LINE>
<LINE>But not one follower.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>So am I purposed.</LINE>
<LINE>Where is my lord of Gloucester?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORNWALL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Follow'd the old man forth: he is return'd.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The king is in high rage.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORNWALL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Whither is he going?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He calls to horse; but will I know not whither.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORNWALL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis best to give him way; he leads himself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GONERIL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, entreat him by no means to stay.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alack, the night comes on, and the bleak winds</LINE>
<LINE>Do sorely ruffle; for many miles about</LINE>
<LINE>There's scarce a bush.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REGAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, sir, to wilful men,</LINE>
<LINE>The injuries that they themselves procure</LINE>
<LINE>Must be their schoolmasters. Shut up your doors:</LINE>
<LINE>He is attended with a desperate train;</LINE>
<LINE>And what they may incense him to, being apt</LINE>
<LINE>To have his ear abused, wisdom bids fear.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORNWALL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Shut up your doors, my lord; 'tis a wild night:</LINE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE I.  A heath.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Storm still. Enter KENT and a Gentleman, meeting</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who's there, besides foul weather?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Gentleman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>One minded like the weather, most unquietly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know you. Where's the king?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Gentleman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Contending with the fretful element:</LINE>
<LINE>Bids the winds blow the earth into the sea,</LINE>
<LINE>Or swell the curled water 'bove the main,</LINE>
<LINE>That things might change or cease; tears his white hair,</LINE>
<LINE>Which the impetuous blasts, with eyeless rage,</LINE>
<LINE>Catch in their fury, and make nothing of;</LINE>
<LINE>Strives in his little world of man to out-scorn</LINE>
<LINE>The to-and-fro-conflicting wind and rain.</LINE>
<LINE>This night, wherein the cub-drawn bear would couch,</LINE>
<LINE>The lion and the belly-pinched wolf</LINE>
<LINE>Keep their fur dry, unbonneted he runs,</LINE>
<LINE>And bids what will take all.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But who is with him?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Gentleman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>None but the fool; who labours to out-jest</LINE>
<LINE>His heart-struck injuries.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, I do know you;</LINE>
<LINE>And dare, upon the warrant of my note,</LINE>
<LINE>Commend a dear thing to you. There is division,</LINE>
<LINE>Although as yet the face of it be cover'd</LINE>
<LINE>With mutual cunning, 'twixt Albany and Cornwall;</LINE>
<LINE>Who have--as who have not, that their great stars</LINE>
<LINE>Throned and set high?--servants, who seem no less,</LINE>
<LINE>Which are to France the spies and speculations</LINE>
<LINE>Intelligent of our state; what hath been seen,</LINE>
<LINE>Either in snuffs and packings of the dukes,</LINE>
<LINE>Or the hard rein which both of them have borne</LINE>
<LINE>Against the old kind king; or something deeper,</LINE>
<LINE>Whereof perchance these are but furnishings;</LINE>
<LINE>But, true it is, from France there comes a power</LINE>
<LINE>Into this scatter'd kingdom; who already,</LINE>
<LINE>Wise in our negligence, have secret feet</LINE>
<LINE>In some of our best ports, and are at point</LINE>
<LINE>To show their open banner. Now to you:</LINE>
<LINE>If on my credit you dare build so far</LINE>
<LINE>To make your speed to Dover, you shall find</LINE>
<LINE>Some that will thank you, making just report</LINE>
<LINE>Of how unnatural and bemadding sorrow</LINE>
<LINE>The king hath cause to plain.</LINE>
<LINE>I am a gentleman of blood and breeding;</LINE>
<LINE>And, from some knowledge and assurance, offer</LINE>
<LINE>This office to you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Gentleman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will talk further with you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, do not.</LINE>
<LINE>For confirmation that I am much more</LINE>
<LINE>Than my out-wall, open this purse, and take</LINE>
<LINE>What it contains. If you shall see Cordelia,--</LINE>
<LINE>As fear not but you shall,--show her this ring;</LINE>
<LINE>And she will tell you who your fellow is</LINE>
<LINE>That yet you do not know. Fie on this storm!</LINE>
<LINE>I will go seek the king.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Gentleman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Give me your hand: have you no more to say?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Few words, but, to effect, more than all yet;</LINE>
<LINE>That, when we have found the king,--in which your pain</LINE>
<LINE>That way, I'll this,--he that first lights on him</LINE>
<LINE>Holla the other.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! rage! blow!</LINE>
<LINE>You cataracts and hurricanoes, spout</LINE>
<LINE>Till you have drench'd our steeples, drown'd the cocks!</LINE>
<LINE>You sulphurous and thought-executing fires,</LINE>
<LINE>Vaunt-couriers to oak-cleaving thunderbolts,</LINE>
<LINE>Singe my white head! And thou, all-shaking thunder,</LINE>
<LINE>Smite flat the thick rotundity o' the world!</LINE>
<LINE>Crack nature's moulds, an germens spill at once,</LINE>
<LINE>That make ingrateful man!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Fool</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O nuncle, court holy-water in a dry</LINE>
<LINE>house is better than this rain-water out o' door.</LINE>
<LINE>Good nuncle, in, and ask thy daughters' blessing:</LINE>
<LINE>here's a night pities neither wise man nor fool.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Rumble thy bellyful! Spit, fire! spout, rain!</LINE>
<LINE>Nor rain, wind, thunder, fire, are my daughters:</LINE>
<LINE>I tax not you, you elements, with unkindness;</LINE>
<LINE>I never gave you kingdom, call'd you children,</LINE>
<LINE>You owe me no subscription: then let fall</LINE>
<LINE>Your horrible pleasure: here I stand, your slave,</LINE>
<LINE>A poor, infirm, weak, and despised old man:</LINE>
<LINE>But yet I call you servile ministers,</LINE>
<LINE>That have with two pernicious daughters join'd</LINE>
<LINE>Your high engender'd battles 'gainst a head</LINE>
<LINE>So old and white as this. O! O! 'tis foul!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Fool</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He that has a house to put's head in has a good</LINE>
<LINE>head-piece.</LINE>
<LINE>The cod-piece that will house</LINE>
<LINE>Before the head has any,</LINE>
<LINE>The head and he shall louse;</LINE>
<LINE>So beggars marry many.</LINE>
<LINE>The man that makes his toe</LINE>
<LINE>What he his heart should make</LINE>
<LINE>Shall of a corn cry woe,</LINE>
<LINE>And turn his sleep to wake.</LINE>
<LINE>For there was never yet fair woman but she made</LINE>
<LINE>mouths in a glass.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>No, I will be the pattern of all patience;</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Fool</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, here's grace and a cod-piece; that's a wise</LINE>
<LINE>man and a fool.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alas, sir, are you here? things that love night</LINE>
<LINE>Love not such nights as these; the wrathful skies</LINE>
<LINE>Gallow the very wanderers of the dark,</LINE>
<LINE>And make them keep their caves: since I was man,</LINE>
<LINE>Such sheets of fire, such bursts of horrid thunder,</LINE>
<LINE>Such groans of roaring wind and rain, I never</LINE>
<LINE>Remember to have heard: man's nature cannot carry</LINE>
<LINE>The affliction nor the fear.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let the great gods,</LINE>
<LINE>That keep this dreadful pother o'er our heads,</LINE>
<LINE>Find out their enemies now. Tremble, thou wretch,</LINE>
<LINE>That hast within thee undivulged crimes,</LINE>
<LINE>Unwhipp'd of justice: hide thee, thou bloody hand;</LINE>
<LINE>Thou perjured, and thou simular man of virtue</LINE>
<LINE>That art incestuous: caitiff, to pieces shake,</LINE>
<LINE>That under covert and convenient seeming</LINE>
<LINE>Hast practised on man's life: close pent-up guilts,</LINE>
<LINE>Rive your concealing continents, and cry</LINE>
<LINE>These dreadful summoners grace. I am a man</LINE>
<LINE>More sinn'd against than sinning.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alack, bare-headed!</LINE>
<LINE>Gracious my lord, hard by here is a hovel;</LINE>
<LINE>Some friendship will it lend you 'gainst the tempest:</LINE>
<LINE>Repose you there; while I to this hard house--</LINE>
<LINE>More harder than the stones whereof 'tis raised;</LINE>
<LINE>Which even but now, demanding after you,</LINE>
<LINE>Denied me to come in--return, and force</LINE>
<LINE>Their scanted courtesy.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My wits begin to turn.</LINE>
<LINE>Come on, my boy: how dost, my boy? art cold?</LINE>
<LINE>I am cold myself. Where is this straw, my fellow?</LINE>
<LINE>The art of our necessities is strange,</LINE>
<LINE>That can make vile things precious. Come,</LINE>
<LINE>your hovel.</LINE>
<LINE>Poor fool and knave, I have one part in my heart</LINE>
<LINE>That's sorry yet for thee.</LINE>

<LINE>This is a brave night to cool a courtezan.</LINE>
<LINE>I'll speak a prophecy ere I go:</LINE>
<LINE>When priests are more in word than matter;</LINE>
<LINE>When brewers mar their malt with water;</LINE>
<LINE>When nobles are their tailors' tutors;</LINE>
<LINE>No heretics burn'd, but wenches' suitors;</LINE>
<LINE>When every case in law is right;</LINE>
<LINE>No squire in debt, nor no poor knight;</LINE>
<LINE>When slanders do not live in tongues;</LINE>
<LINE>Nor cutpurses come not to throngs;</LINE>
<LINE>When usurers tell their gold i' the field;</LINE>
<LINE>And bawds and whores do churches build;</LINE>
<LINE>Then shall the realm of Albion</LINE>
<LINE>Come to great confusion:</LINE>
<LINE>Then comes the time, who lives to see't,</LINE>
<LINE>That going shall be used with feet.</LINE>
<LINE>This prophecy Merlin shall make; for I live before his time.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter GLOUCESTER and EDMUND</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alack, alack, Edmund, I like not this unnatural</LINE>
<LINE>dealing. When I desire their leave that I might</LINE>
<LINE>pity him, they took from me the use of mine own</LINE>
<LINE>house; charged me, on pain of their perpetual</LINE>
<LINE>displeasure, neither to speak of him, entreat for</LINE>
<LINE>him, nor any way sustain him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDMUND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Most savage and unnatural!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go to; say you nothing. There's a division betwixt</LINE>
<LINE>the dukes; and a worse matter than that: I have</LINE>
<LINE>received a letter this night; 'tis dangerous to be</LINE>
<LINE>spoken; I have locked the letter in my closet:</LINE>
<LINE>these injuries the king now bears will be revenged</LINE>
<LINE>home; there's part of a power already footed: we</LINE>
<LINE>must incline to the king. I will seek him, and</LINE>
<LINE>privily relieve him: go you and maintain talk with</LINE>
<LINE>the duke, that my charity be not of him perceived:</LINE>
<LINE>if he ask for me. I am ill, and gone to bed.</LINE>
<LINE>Though I die for it, as no less is threatened me,</LINE>
<LINE>the king my old master must be relieved. There is</LINE>
<LINE>some strange thing toward, Edmund; pray you, be careful.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDMUND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This courtesy, forbid thee, shall the duke</LINE>
<LINE>Instantly know; and of that letter too:</LINE>
<LINE>This seems a fair deserving, and must draw me</LINE>
<LINE>That which my father loses; no less than all:</LINE>

<LINE>Invades us to the skin: so 'tis to thee;</LINE>
<LINE>But where the greater malady is fix'd,</LINE>
<LINE>The lesser is scarce felt. Thou'ldst shun a bear;</LINE>
<LINE>But if thy flight lay toward the raging sea,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou'ldst meet the bear i' the mouth. When the</LINE>
<LINE>mind's free,</LINE>
<LINE>The body's delicate: the tempest in my mind</LINE>
<LINE>Doth from my senses take all feeling else</LINE>
<LINE>Save what beats there. Filial ingratitude!</LINE>
<LINE>Is it not as this mouth should tear this hand</LINE>
<LINE>For lifting food to't? But I will punish home:</LINE>
<LINE>No, I will weep no more. In such a night</LINE>
<LINE>To shut me out! Pour on; I will endure.</LINE>
<LINE>In such a night as this! O Regan, Goneril!</LINE>

<LINE>proud of heart, to ride on a bay trotting-horse over</LINE>
<LINE>four-inched bridges, to course his own shadow for a</LINE>

<LINE>her; swore as many oaths as I spake words, and</LINE>
<LINE>broke them in the sweet face of heaven: one that</LINE>
<LINE>slept in the contriving of lust, and waked to do it:</LINE>
<LINE>wine loved I deeply, dice dearly: and in woman</LINE>
<LINE>out-paramoured the Turk: false of heart, light of</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORNWALL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I now perceive, it was not altogether your</LINE>

<LINE>How malicious is my fortune, that I must repent to</LINE>

<LINE>In his anointed flesh stick boarish fangs.</LINE>
<LINE>The sea, with such a storm as his bare head</LINE>
<LINE>In hell-black night endured, would have buoy'd up,</LINE>
<LINE>And quench'd the stelled fires:</LINE>
<LINE>Yet, poor old heart, he holp the heavens to rain.</LINE>
<LINE>If wolves had at thy gate howl'd that stern time,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou shouldst have said 'Good porter, turn the key,'</LINE>
<LINE>All cruels else subscribed: but I shall see</LINE>
<LINE>The winged vengeance overtake such children.</LINE>

<LINE>Yet better thus, and known to be contemn'd,</LINE>

<LINE>The lowest and most dejected thing of fortune,</LINE>
<LINE>Stands still in esperance, lives not in fear:</LINE>
<LINE>The lamentable change is from the best;</LINE>
<LINE>The worst returns to laughter. Welcome, then,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have no way, and therefore want no eyes;</LINE>
<LINE>I stumbled when I saw: full oft 'tis seen,</LINE>

<LINE>thee, good man's son, from the foul fiend! five</LINE>
<LINE>fiends have been in poor Tom at once; of lust, as</LINE>
<LINE>Obidicut; Hobbididence, prince of dumbness; Mahu, of</LINE>
<LINE>stealing; Modo, of murder; Flibbertigibbet, of</LINE>
<LINE>mopping and mowing, who since possesses chambermaids</LINE>

<LINE>Let the superfluous and lust-dieted man,</LINE>
<LINE>That slaves your ordinance, that will not see</LINE>

<LINE>Welcome, my lord: I marvel our mild husband</LINE>
<LINE>Not met us on the way.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter OSWALD</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Now, where's your master'?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OSWALD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam, within; but never man so changed.</LINE>
<LINE>I told him of the army that was landed;</LINE>
<LINE>He smiled at it: I told him you were coming:</LINE>
<LINE>His answer was 'The worse:' of Gloucester's treachery,</LINE>
<LINE>And of the loyal service of his son,</LINE>
<LINE>When I inform'd him, then he call'd me sot,</LINE>
<LINE>And told me I had turn'd the wrong side out:</LINE>
<LINE>What most he should dislike seems pleasant to him;</LINE>
<LINE>What like, offensive.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GONERIL</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>To EDMUND</STAGEDIR>  Then shall you go no further.</LINE>
<LINE>It is the cowish terror of his spirit,</LINE>
<LINE>That dares not undertake: he'll not feel wrongs</LINE>
<LINE>Which tie him to an answer. Our wishes on the way</LINE>
<LINE>May prove effects. Back, Edmund, to my brother;</LINE>
<LINE>Hasten his musters and conduct his powers:</LINE>
<LINE>I must change arms at home, and give the distaff</LINE>
<LINE>Into my husband's hands. This trusty servant</LINE>
<LINE>Shall pass between us: ere long you are like to hear,</LINE>
<LINE>If you dare venture in your own behalf,</LINE>
<LINE>A mistress's command. Wear this; spare speech;</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Giving a favour</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Decline your head: this kiss, if it durst speak,</LINE>
<LINE>Would stretch thy spirits up into the air:</LINE>
<LINE>Conceive, and fare thee well.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GONERIL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have been worth the whistle.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALBANY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O Goneril!</LINE>
<LINE>You are not worth the dust which the rude wind</LINE>
<LINE>Blows in your face. I fear your disposition:</LINE>
<LINE>That nature, which contemns its origin,</LINE>
<LINE>Cannot be border'd certain in itself;</LINE>
<LINE>She that herself will sliver and disbranch</LINE>
<LINE>From her material sap, perforce must wither</LINE>
<LINE>And come to deadly use.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GONERIL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No more; the text is foolish.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALBANY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile:</LINE>
<LINE>Filths savour but themselves. What have you done?</LINE>
<LINE>Tigers, not daughters, what have you perform'd?</LINE>
<LINE>A father, and a gracious aged man,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose reverence even the head-lugg'd bear would lick,</LINE>
<LINE>Most barbarous, most degenerate! have you madded.</LINE>
<LINE>Could my good brother suffer you to do it?</LINE>
<LINE>A man, a prince, by him so benefited!</LINE>
<LINE>If that the heavens do not their visible spirits</LINE>
<LINE>Send quickly down to tame these vile offences,</LINE>
<LINE>It will come,</LINE>
<LINE>Humanity must perforce prey on itself,</LINE>
<LINE>Like monsters of the deep.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GONERIL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Milk-liver'd man!</LINE>
<LINE>That bear'st a cheek for blows, a head for wrongs;</LINE>
<LINE>Who hast not in thy brows an eye discerning</LINE>
<LINE>Thine honour from thy suffering; that not know'st</LINE>
<LINE>Fools do those villains pity who are punish'd</LINE>
<LINE>Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?</LINE>
<LINE>France spreads his banners in our noiseless land;</LINE>
<LINE>With plumed helm thy slayer begins threats;</LINE>
<LINE>Whiles thou, a moral fool, sit'st still, and criest</LINE>
<LINE>'Alack, why does he so?'</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, my good lord, the Duke of Cornwall's dead:</LINE>
<LINE>Slain by his servant, going to put out</LINE>
<LINE>The other eye of Gloucester.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALBANY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Gloucester's eye!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A servant that he bred, thrill'd with remorse,</LINE>
<LINE>Opposed against the act, bending his sword</LINE>
<LINE>To his great master; who, thereat enraged,</LINE>
<LINE>Flew on him, and amongst them fell'd him dead;</LINE>
<LINE>But not without that harmful stroke, which since</LINE>
<LINE>Hath pluck'd him after.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALBANY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This shows you are above,</LINE>
<LINE>You justicers, that these our nether crimes</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter KENT and a Gentleman</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why the King of France is so suddenly gone back</LINE>
<LINE>know you the reason?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Gentleman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Something he left imperfect in the</LINE>
<LINE>state, which since his coming forth is thought</LINE>
<LINE>of; which imports to the kingdom so much</LINE>
<LINE>fear and danger, that his personal return was</LINE>
<LINE>most required and necessary.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who hath he left behind him general?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Gentleman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The Marshal of France, Monsieur La Far.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Did your letters pierce the queen to any</LINE>
<LINE>demonstration of grief?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Gentleman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, sir; she took them, read them in my presence;</LINE>
<LINE>And now and then an ample tear trill'd down</LINE>
<LINE>Her delicate cheek: it seem'd she was a queen</LINE>
<LINE>Over her passion; who, most rebel-like,</LINE>
<LINE>Sought to be king o'er her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, then it moved her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Gentleman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not to a rage: patience and sorrow strove</LINE>
<LINE>Who should express her goodliest. You have seen</LINE>
<LINE>Sunshine and rain at once: her smiles and tears</LINE>
<LINE>Were like a better way: those happy smilets,</LINE>
<LINE>That play'd on her ripe lip, seem'd not to know</LINE>
<LINE>What guests were in her eyes; which parted thence,</LINE>
<LINE>As pearls from diamonds dropp'd. In brief,</LINE>
<LINE>Sorrow would be a rarity most beloved,</LINE>
<LINE>If all could so become it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Made she no verbal question?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Gentleman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Faith, once or twice she heaved the name of 'father'</LINE>
<LINE>Pantingly forth, as if it press'd her heart:</LINE>
<LINE>Cried 'Sisters! sisters! Shame of ladies! sisters!</LINE>
<LINE>Kent! father! sisters! What, i' the storm? i' the night?</LINE>
<LINE>Let pity not be believed!' There she shook</LINE>
<LINE>The holy water from her heavenly eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>And clamour moisten'd: then away she started</LINE>
<LINE>To deal with grief alone.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is the stars,</LINE>
<LINE>The stars above us, govern our conditions;</LINE>
<LINE>Else one self mate and mate could not beget</LINE>
<LINE>Such different issues. You spoke not with her since?</LINE>

<SPEAKER>Gentleman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No.</LINE>

<LINE>No, since.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, sir, the poor distressed Lear's i' the town;</LINE>
<LINE>Who sometime, in his better tune, remembers</LINE>
<LINE>What we are come about, and by no means</LINE>
<LINE>Will yield to see his daughter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Gentleman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, good sir?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A sovereign shame so elbows him: his own unkindness,</LINE>
<LINE>That stripp'd her from his benediction, turn'd her</LINE>
<LINE>To foreign casualties, gave her dear rights</LINE>
<LINE>To his dog-hearted daughters, these things sting</LINE>
<LINE>His mind so venomously, that burning shame</LINE>
<LINE>Detains him from Cordelia.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Gentleman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alack, poor gentleman!</LINE>

<LINE>Alack, 'tis he: why, he was met even now</LINE>
<LINE>As mad as the vex'd sea; singing aloud;</LINE>
<LINE>Crown'd with rank fumiter and furrow-weeds,</LINE>
<LINE>With bur-docks, hemlock, nettles, cuckoo-flowers,</LINE>
<LINE>Darnel, and all the idle weeds that grow</LINE>
<LINE>In our sustaining corn. A century send forth;</LINE>
<LINE>Search every acre in the high-grown field,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REGAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But are my brother's powers set forth?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OSWALD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, madam.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REGAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Himself in person there?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OSWALD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam, with much ado:</LINE>
<LINE>Your sister is the better soldier.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REGAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lord Edmund spake not with your lord at home?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OSWALD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, madam.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REGAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What might import my sister's letter to him?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OSWALD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know not, lady.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REGAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Faith, he is posted hence on serious matter.</LINE>
<LINE>It was great ignorance, Gloucester's eyes being out,</LINE>
<LINE>To let him live: where he arrives he moves</LINE>
<LINE>All hearts against us: Edmund, I think, is gone,</LINE>
<LINE>In pity of his misery, to dispatch</LINE>
<LINE>His nighted life: moreover, to descry</LINE>
<LINE>The strength o' the enemy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OSWALD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I must needs after him, madam, with my letter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REGAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Our troops set forth to-morrow: stay with us;</LINE>
<LINE>The ways are dangerous.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OSWALD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I may not, madam:</LINE>
<LINE>My lady charged my duty in this business.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REGAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why should she write to Edmund? Might not you</LINE>
<LINE>Transport her purposes by word? Belike,</LINE>
<LINE>Something--I know not what: I'll love thee much,</LINE>
<LINE>Let me unseal the letter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OSWALD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam, I had rather--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REGAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know your lady does not love her husband;</LINE>
<LINE>I am sure of that: and at her late being here</LINE>
<LINE>She gave strange oeillades and most speaking looks</LINE>
<LINE>To noble Edmund. I know you are of her bosom.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OSWALD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I, madam?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REGAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I speak in understanding; you are; I know't:</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore I do advise you, take this note:</LINE>
<LINE>My lord is dead; Edmund and I have talk'd;</LINE>
<LINE>And more convenient is he for my hand</LINE>
<LINE>Than for your lady's: you may gather more.</LINE>
<LINE>If you do find him, pray you, give him this;</LINE>
<LINE>And when your mistress hears thus much from you,</LINE>
<LINE>I pray, desire her call her wisdom to her.</LINE>
<LINE>So, fare you well.</LINE>
<LINE>If you do chance to hear of that blind traitor,</LINE>
<LINE>Preferment falls on him that cuts him off.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE VI.  Fields near Dover.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter GLOUCESTER, and EDGAR dressed like a peasant</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>When shall we come to the top of that same hill?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDGAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You do climb up it now: look, how we labour.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Methinks the ground is even.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDGAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Horrible steep.</LINE>
<LINE>Hark, do you hear the sea?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, truly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDGAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, then, your other senses grow imperfect</LINE>
<LINE>By your eyes' anguish.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So may it be, indeed:</LINE>
<LINE>Methinks thy voice is alter'd; and thou speak'st</LINE>
<LINE>In better phrase and matter than thou didst.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDGAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You're much deceived: in nothing am I changed</LINE>
<LINE>But in my garments.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Methinks you're better spoken.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDGAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come on, sir; here's the place: stand still. How fearful</LINE>
<LINE>And dizzy 'tis, to cast one's eyes so low!</LINE>
<LINE>The crows and choughs that wing the midway air</LINE>
<LINE>Show scarce so gross as beetles: half way down</LINE>
<LINE>Hangs one that gathers samphire, dreadful trade!</LINE>
<LINE>Methinks he seems no bigger than his head:</LINE>
<LINE>The fishermen, that walk upon the beach,</LINE>
<LINE>Appear like mice; and yond tall anchoring bark,</LINE>
<LINE>Diminish'd to her cock; her cock, a buoy</LINE>
<LINE>Almost too small for sight: the murmuring surge,</LINE>
<LINE>That on the unnumber'd idle pebbles chafes,</LINE>
<LINE>Cannot be heard so high. I'll look no more;</LINE>
<LINE>Lest my brain turn, and the deficient sight</LINE>
<LINE>Topple down headlong.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Set me where you stand.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDGAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Give me your hand: you are now within a foot</LINE>
<LINE>Of the extreme verge: for all beneath the moon</LINE>
<LINE>Would I not leap upright.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let go my hand.</LINE>
<LINE>Here, friend, 's another purse; in it a jewel</LINE>
<LINE>Well worth a poor man's taking: fairies and gods</LINE>
<LINE>Prosper it with thee! Go thou farther off;</LINE>
<LINE>Bid me farewell, and let me hear thee going.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDGAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now fare you well, good sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With all my heart.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDGAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why I do trifle thus with his despair</LINE>
<LINE>Is done to cure it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Kneeling</STAGEDIR>  O you mighty gods!</LINE>
<LINE>This world I do renounce, and, in your sights,</LINE>
<LINE>Shake patiently my great affliction off:</LINE>
<LINE>If I could bear it longer, and not fall</LINE>
<LINE>To quarrel with your great opposeless wills,</LINE>
<LINE>My snuff and loathed part of nature should</LINE>
<LINE>Burn itself out. If Edgar live, O, bless him!</LINE>
<LINE>Now, fellow, fare thee well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>He falls forward</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDGAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Gone, sir: farewell.</LINE>
<LINE>And yet I know not how conceit may rob</LINE>
<LINE>The treasury of life, when life itself</LINE>
<LINE>Yields to the theft: had he been where he thought,</LINE>
<LINE>By this, had thought been past. Alive or dead?</LINE>
<LINE>Ho, you sir! friend! Hear you, sir! speak!</LINE>
<LINE>Thus might he pass indeed: yet he revives.</LINE>
<LINE>What are you, sir?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Away, and let me die.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDGAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hadst thou been aught but gossamer, feathers, air,</LINE>
<LINE>So many fathom down precipitating,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou'dst shiver'd like an egg: but thou dost breathe;</LINE>
<LINE>Hast heavy substance; bleed'st not; speak'st; art sound.</LINE>
<LINE>Ten masts at each make not the altitude</LINE>
<LINE>Which thou hast perpendicularly fell:</LINE>
<LINE>Thy life's a miracle. Speak yet again.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But have I fall'n, or no?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDGAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>From the dread summit of this chalky bourn.</LINE>
<LINE>Look up a-height; the shrill-gorged lark so far</LINE>
<LINE>Cannot be seen or heard: do but look up.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alack, I have no eyes.</LINE>
<LINE>Is wretchedness deprived that benefit,</LINE>
<LINE>To end itself by death? 'Twas yet some comfort,</LINE>
<LINE>When misery could beguile the tyrant's rage,</LINE>
<LINE>And frustrate his proud will.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDGAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Give me your arm:</LINE>
<LINE>Up: so. How is 't? Feel you your legs? You stand.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Too well, too well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDGAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is above all strangeness.</LINE>
<LINE>Upon the crown o' the cliff, what thing was that</LINE>
<LINE>Which parted from you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A poor unfortunate beggar.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDGAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As I stood here below, methought his eyes</LINE>
<LINE>Were two full moons; he had a thousand noses,</LINE>
<LINE>Horns whelk'd and waved like the enridged sea:</LINE>
<LINE>It was some fiend; therefore, thou happy father,</LINE>
<LINE>Think that the clearest gods, who make them honours</LINE>
<LINE>Of men's impossibilities, have preserved thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do remember now: henceforth I'll bear</LINE>
<LINE>Affliction till it do cry out itself</LINE>
<LINE>'Enough, enough,' and die. That thing you speak of,</LINE>
<LINE>I took it for a man; often 'twould say</LINE>
<LINE>'The fiend, the fiend:' he led me to that place.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDGAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Bear free and patient thoughts. But who comes here?</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter KING LEAR, fantastically dressed with wild flowers</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>The safer sense will ne'er accommodate</LINE>
<LINE>His master thus.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, they cannot touch me for coining; I am the</LINE>
<LINE>king himself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDGAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O thou side-piercing sight!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nature's above art in that respect. There's your</LINE>
<LINE>press-money. That fellow handles his bow like a</LINE>
<LINE>crow-keeper: draw me a clothier's yard. Look,</LINE>
<LINE>look, a mouse! Peace, peace; this piece of toasted</LINE>
<LINE>cheese will do 't. There's my gauntlet; I'll prove</LINE>
<LINE>it on a giant. Bring up the brown bills. O, well</LINE>
<LINE>flown, bird! i' the clout, i' the clout: hewgh!</LINE>
<LINE>Give the word.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDGAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sweet marjoram.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pass.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know that voice.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ha! Goneril, with a white beard! They flattered</LINE>
<LINE>me like a dog; and told me I had white hairs in my</LINE>
<LINE>beard ere the black ones were there. To say 'ay'</LINE>
<LINE>and 'no' to every thing that I said!--'Ay' and 'no'</LINE>
<LINE>too was no good divinity. When the rain came to</LINE>
<LINE>wet me once, and the wind to make me chatter; when</LINE>
<LINE>the thunder would not peace at my bidding; there I</LINE>
<LINE>found 'em, there I smelt 'em out. Go to, they are</LINE>
<LINE>not men o' their words: they told me I was every</LINE>
<LINE>thing; 'tis a lie, I am not ague-proof.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The trick of that voice I do well remember:</LINE>
<LINE>Is 't not the king?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, every inch a king:</LINE>
<LINE>When I do stare, see how the subject quakes.</LINE>
<LINE>I pardon that man's life. What was thy cause? Adultery?</LINE>
<LINE>Thou shalt not die: die for adultery! No:</LINE>
<LINE>The wren goes to 't, and the small gilded fly</LINE>
<LINE>Does lecher in my sight.</LINE>
<LINE>Let copulation thrive; for Gloucester's bastard son</LINE>
<LINE>Was kinder to his father than my daughters</LINE>
<LINE>Got 'tween the lawful sheets.</LINE>
<LINE>To 't, luxury, pell-mell! for I lack soldiers.</LINE>
<LINE>Behold yond simpering dame,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose face between her forks presages snow;</LINE>
<LINE>That minces virtue, and does shake the head</LINE>
<LINE>To hear of pleasure's name;</LINE>
<LINE>The fitchew, nor the soiled horse, goes to 't</LINE>
<LINE>With a more riotous appetite.</LINE>
<LINE>Down from the waist they are Centaurs,</LINE>
<LINE>Though women all above:</LINE>
<LINE>But to the girdle do the gods inherit,</LINE>
<LINE>Beneath is all the fiends';</LINE>
<LINE>There's hell, there's darkness, there's the</LINE>
<LINE>sulphurous pit,</LINE>
<LINE>Burning, scalding, stench, consumption; fie,</LINE>
<LINE>fie, fie! pah, pah! Give me an ounce of civet,</LINE>
<LINE>good apothecary, to sweeten my imagination:</LINE>
<LINE>there's money for thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, let me kiss that hand!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let me wipe it first; it smells of mortality.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O ruin'd piece of nature! This great world</LINE>
<LINE>Shall so wear out to nought. Dost thou know me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I remember thine eyes well enough. Dost thou squiny</LINE>
<LINE>at me? No, do thy worst, blind Cupid! I'll not</LINE>
<LINE>love. Read thou this challenge; mark but the</LINE>
<LINE>penning of it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Were all the letters suns, I could not see one.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDGAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would not take this from report; it is,</LINE>
<LINE>And my heart breaks at it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Read.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, with the case of eyes?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, ho, are you there with me? No eyes in your</LINE>
<LINE>head, nor no money in your purse? Your eyes are in</LINE>
<LINE>a heavy case, your purse in a light; yet you see how</LINE>
<LINE>this world goes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I see it feelingly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, art mad? A man may see how this world goes</LINE>
<LINE>with no eyes. Look with thine ears: see how yond</LINE>
<LINE>justice rails upon yond simple thief. Hark, in</LINE>
<LINE>thine ear: change places; and, handy-dandy, which</LINE>
<LINE>is the justice, which is the thief? Thou hast seen</LINE>
<LINE>a farmer's dog bark at a beggar?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And the creature run from the cur? There thou</LINE>
<LINE>mightst behold the great image of authority: a</LINE>
<LINE>dog's obeyed in office.</LINE>
<LINE>Thou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody hand!</LINE>
<LINE>Why dost thou lash that whore? Strip thine own back;</LINE>
<LINE>Thou hotly lust'st to use her in that kind</LINE>
<LINE>For which thou whipp'st her. The usurer hangs the cozener.</LINE>
<LINE>Through tatter'd clothes small vices do appear;</LINE>
<LINE>Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,</LINE>
<LINE>And the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks:</LINE>
<LINE>Arm it in rags, a pigmy's straw does pierce it.</LINE>
<LINE>None does offend, none, I say, none; I'll able 'em:</LINE>
<LINE>Take that of me, my friend, who have the power</LINE>
<LINE>To seal the accuser's lips. Get thee glass eyes;</LINE>
<LINE>And like a scurvy politician, seem</LINE>
<LINE>To see the things thou dost not. Now, now, now, now:</LINE>
<LINE>Pull off my boots: harder, harder: so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDGAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, matter and impertinency mix'd! Reason in madness!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If thou wilt weep my fortunes, take my eyes.</LINE>
<LINE>I know thee well enough; thy name is Gloucester:</LINE>
<LINE>Thou must be patient; we came crying hither:</LINE>
<LINE>Thou know'st, the first time that we smell the air,</LINE>
<LINE>We wawl and cry. I will preach to thee: mark.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alack, alack the day!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>When we are born, we cry that we are come</LINE>
<LINE>To this great stage of fools: this a good block;</LINE>
<LINE>It were a delicate stratagem, to shoe</LINE>
<LINE>A troop of horse with felt: I'll put 't in proof;</LINE>
<LINE>And when I have stol'n upon these sons-in-law,</LINE>
<LINE>Then, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter a Gentleman, with Attendants</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Gentleman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, here he is: lay hand upon him. Sir,</LINE>
<LINE>Your most dear daughter--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No rescue? What, a prisoner? I am even</LINE>
<LINE>The natural fool of fortune. Use me well;</LINE>
<LINE>You shall have ransom. Let me have surgeons;</LINE>
<LINE>I am cut to the brains.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Gentleman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You shall have any thing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No seconds? all myself?</LINE>
<LINE>Why, this would make a man a man of salt,</LINE>
<LINE>To use his eyes for garden water-pots,</LINE>
<LINE>Ay, and laying autumn's dust.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Gentleman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good sir,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will die bravely, like a bridegroom. What!</LINE>
<LINE>I will be jovial: come, come; I am a king,</LINE>
<LINE>My masters, know you that.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Gentleman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You are a royal one, and we obey you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then there's life in't. Nay, if you get it, you</LINE>
<LINE>shall get it with running. Sa, sa, sa, sa.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit running; Attendants follow</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Gentleman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A sight most pitiful in the meanest wretch,</LINE>
<LINE>Past speaking of in a king! Thou hast one daughter,</LINE>
<LINE>Who redeems nature from the general curse</LINE>
<LINE>Which twain have brought her to.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDGAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hail, gentle sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Gentleman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, speed you: what's your will?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDGAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do you hear aught, sir, of a battle toward?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Gentleman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Most sure and vulgar: every one hears that,</LINE>
<LINE>Which can distinguish sound.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDGAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But, by your favour,</LINE>
<LINE>How near's the other army?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Gentleman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Near and on speedy foot; the main descry</LINE>
<LINE>Stands on the hourly thought.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDGAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I thank you, sir: that's all.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDGAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sit you down, father; rest you</LINE>
<LINE>Let's see these pockets: the letters that he speaks of</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The king is mad: how stiff is my vile sense,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORDELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O thou good Kent, how shall I live and work,</LINE>
<LINE>To match thy goodness? My life will be too short,</LINE>
<LINE>And every measure fail me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To be acknowledged, madam, is o'erpaid.</LINE>
<LINE>All my reports go with the modest truth;</LINE>
<LINE>Nor more nor clipp'd, but so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORDELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Be better suited:</LINE>
<LINE>These weeds are memories of those worser hours:</LINE>
<LINE>I prithee, put them off.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pardon me, dear madam;</LINE>
<LINE>Yet to be known shortens my made intent:</LINE>
<LINE>My boon I make it, that you know me not</LINE>
<LINE>Till time and I think meet.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORDELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then be't so, my good lord.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>To the Doctor</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>How does the king?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Doctor</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam, sleeps still.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORDELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O you kind gods,</LINE>
<LINE>Cure this great breach in his abused nature!</LINE>
<LINE>The untuned and jarring senses, O, wind up</LINE>
<LINE>Of this child-changed father!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Doctor</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So please your majesty</LINE>
<LINE>That we may wake the king: he hath slept long.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORDELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Be govern'd by your knowledge, and proceed</LINE>
<LINE>I' the sway of your own will. Is he array'd?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Gentleman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, madam; in the heaviness of his sleep</LINE>
<LINE>We put fresh garments on him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Doctor</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Be by, good madam, when we do awake him;</LINE>
<LINE>I doubt not of his temperance.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>Very well.</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Please you, draw near. Louder the music there!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORDELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O my dear father! Restoration hang</LINE>
<LINE>Thy medicine on my lips; and let this kiss</LINE>
<LINE>Repair those violent harms that my two sisters</LINE>
<LINE>Have in thy reverence made!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Kind and dear princess!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORDELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Had you not been their father, these white flakes</LINE>
<LINE>Had challenged pity of them. Was this a face</LINE>
<LINE>To be opposed against the warring winds?</LINE>
<LINE>To stand against the deep dread-bolted thunder?</LINE>
<LINE>In the most terrible and nimble stroke</LINE>
<LINE>Of quick, cross lightning? to watch--poor perdu!--</LINE>
<LINE>With this thin helm? Mine enemy's dog,</LINE>
<LINE>Though he had bit me, should have stood that night</LINE>
<LINE>Against my fire; and wast thou fain, poor father,</LINE>
<LINE>To hovel thee with swine, and rogues forlorn,</LINE>
<LINE>In short and musty straw? Alack, alack!</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis wonder that thy life and wits at once</LINE>
<LINE>Had not concluded all. He wakes; speak to him.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Doctor</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam, do you; 'tis fittest.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORDELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How does my royal lord? How fares your majesty?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You do me wrong to take me out o' the grave:</LINE>
<LINE>Thou art a soul in bliss; but I am bound</LINE>
<LINE>Upon a wheel of fire, that mine own tears</LINE>
<LINE>Do scald like moulten lead.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORDELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, do you know me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You are a spirit, I know: when did you die?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORDELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Still, still, far wide!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Doctor</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He's scarce awake: let him alone awhile.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where have I been? Where am I? Fair daylight?</LINE>
<LINE>I am mightily abused. I should e'en die with pity,</LINE>
<LINE>To see another thus. I know not what to say.</LINE>
<LINE>I will not swear these are my hands: let's see;</LINE>
<LINE>I feel this pin prick. Would I were assured</LINE>
<LINE>Of my condition!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORDELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, look upon me, sir,</LINE>
<LINE>And hold your hands in benediction o'er me:</LINE>
<LINE>No, sir, you must not kneel.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pray, do not mock me:</LINE>
<LINE>I am a very foolish fond old man,</LINE>
<LINE>Fourscore and upward, not an hour more nor less;</LINE>
<LINE>And, to deal plainly,</LINE>
<LINE>I fear I am not in my perfect mind.</LINE>
<LINE>Methinks I should know you, and know this man;</LINE>
<LINE>Yet I am doubtful for I am mainly ignorant</LINE>
<LINE>What place this is; and all the skill I have</LINE>
<LINE>Remembers not these garments; nor I know not</LINE>
<LINE>Where I did lodge last night. Do not laugh at me;</LINE>
<LINE>For, as I am a man, I think this lady</LINE>
<LINE>To be my child Cordelia.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORDELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And so I am, I am.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Be your tears wet? yes, 'faith. I pray, weep not:</LINE>
<LINE>If you have poison for me, I will drink it.</LINE>
<LINE>I know you do not love me; for your sisters</LINE>
<LINE>Have, as I do remember, done me wrong:</LINE>
<LINE>You have some cause, they have not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORDELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No cause, no cause.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do not abuse me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Doctor</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Be comforted, good madam: the great rage,</LINE>
<LINE>You see, is kill'd in him: and yet it is danger</LINE>
<LINE>To make him even o'er the time he has lost.</LINE>
<LINE>Desire him to go in; trouble him no more</LINE>
<LINE>Till further settling.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORDELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Will't please your highness walk?</LINE>

<LINE>That ebb and flow by the moon.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDMUND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Take them away.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Upon such sacrifices, my Cordelia,</LINE>
<LINE>The gods themselves throw incense. Have I caught thee?</LINE>
<LINE>He that parts us shall bring a brand from heaven,</LINE>
<LINE>And fire us hence like foxes. Wipe thine eyes;</LINE>
<LINE>The good-years shall devour them, flesh and fell,</LINE>
<LINE>Ere they shall make us weep: we'll see 'em starve</LINE>
<LINE>first. Come.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt KING LEAR and CORDELIA, guarded</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDMUND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come hither, captain; hark.</LINE>
<LINE>Take thou this note;</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Giving a paper</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>go follow them to prison:</LINE>
<LINE>One step I have advanced thee; if thou dost</LINE>
<LINE>As this instructs thee, thou dost make thy way</LINE>
<LINE>To noble fortunes: know thou this, that men</LINE>
<LINE>Are as the time is: to be tender-minded</LINE>
<LINE>Does not become a sword: thy great employment</LINE>
<LINE>Will not bear question; either say thou'lt do 't,</LINE>
<LINE>Or thrive by other means.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Captain</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll do 't, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDMUND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>About it; and write happy when thou hast done.</LINE>
<LINE>Mark, I say, instantly; and carry it so</LINE>
<LINE>As I have set it down.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Captain</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I cannot draw a cart, nor eat dried oats;</LINE>
<LINE>If it be man's work, I'll do 't.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>Flourish. Enter ALBANY, GONERIL, REGAN, another
Captain, and Soldiers</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALBANY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, you have shown to-day your valiant strain,</LINE>
<LINE>And fortune led you well: you have the captives</LINE>
<LINE>That were the opposites of this day's strife:</LINE>
<LINE>We do require them of you, so to use them</LINE>
<LINE>As we shall find their merits and our safety</LINE>
<LINE>May equally determine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDMUND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, I thought it fit</LINE>
<LINE>To send the old and miserable king</LINE>
<LINE>To some retention and appointed guard;</LINE>
<LINE>Whose age has charms in it, whose title more,</LINE>
<LINE>To pluck the common bosom on his side,</LINE>
<LINE>An turn our impress'd lances in our eyes</LINE>
<LINE>Which do command them. With him I sent the queen;</LINE>
<LINE>My reason all the same; and they are ready</LINE>
<LINE>To-morrow, or at further space, to appear</LINE>
<LINE>Where you shall hold your session. At this time</LINE>
<LINE>We sweat and bleed: the friend hath lost his friend;</LINE>
<LINE>And the best quarrels, in the heat, are cursed</LINE>
<LINE>By those that feel their sharpness:</LINE>
<LINE>The question of Cordelia and her father</LINE>
<LINE>Requires a fitter place.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALBANY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, by your patience,</LINE>
<LINE>I hold you but a subject of this war,</LINE>
<LINE>Not as a brother.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REGAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That's as we list to grace him.</LINE>
<LINE>Methinks our pleasure might have been demanded,</LINE>
<LINE>Ere you had spoke so far. He led our powers;</LINE>
<LINE>Bore the commission of my place and person;</LINE>
<LINE>The which immediacy may well stand up,</LINE>
<LINE>And call itself your brother.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GONERIL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not so hot:</LINE>
<LINE>In his own grace he doth exalt himself,</LINE>
<LINE>More than in your addition.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REGAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In my rights,</LINE>
<LINE>By me invested, he compeers the best.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GONERIL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That were the most, if he should husband you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REGAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Jesters do oft prove prophets.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GONERIL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Holla, holla!</LINE>
<LINE>That eye that told you so look'd but a-squint.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REGAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lady, I am not well; else I should answer</LINE>
<LINE>From a full-flowing stomach. General,</LINE>
<LINE>Take thou my soldiers, prisoners, patrimony;</LINE>
<LINE>Dispose of them, of me; the walls are thine:</LINE>
<LINE>Witness the world, that I create thee here</LINE>
<LINE>My lord and master.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GONERIL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Mean you to enjoy him?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALBANY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The let-alone lies not in your good will.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDMUND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nor in thine, lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALBANY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Half-blooded fellow, yes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REGAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>To EDMUND</STAGEDIR>  Let the drum strike, and prove my title thine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALBANY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Stay yet; hear reason. Edmund, I arrest thee</LINE>
<LINE>On capital treason; and, in thine attaint,</LINE>
<LINE>This gilded serpent</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Pointing to Goneril</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>For your claim, fair sister,</LINE>
<LINE>I bar it in the interest of my wife:</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis she is sub-contracted to this lord,</LINE>
<LINE>And I, her husband, contradict your bans.</LINE>
<LINE>If you will marry, make your loves to me,</LINE>
<LINE>My lady is bespoke.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GONERIL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>An interlude!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALBANY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou art arm'd, Gloucester: let the trumpet sound:</LINE>
<LINE>If none appear to prove upon thy head</LINE>
<LINE>Thy heinous, manifest, and many treasons,</LINE>
<LINE>There is my pledge;</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Throwing down a glove</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>I'll prove it on thy heart,</LINE>
<LINE>Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less</LINE>
<LINE>Than I have here proclaim'd thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REGAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sick, O, sick!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GONERIL</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  If not, I'll ne'er trust medicine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDMUND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There's my exchange:</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Throwing down a glove</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>what in the world he is</LINE>
<LINE>That names me traitor, villain-like he lies:</LINE>
<LINE>Call by thy trumpet: he that dares approach,</LINE>
<LINE>On him, on you, who not? I will maintain</LINE>
<LINE>My truth and honour firmly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALBANY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A herald, ho!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDMUND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A herald, ho, a herald!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALBANY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Trust to thy single virtue; for thy soldiers,</LINE>
<LINE>All levied in my name, have in my name</LINE>
<LINE>Took their discharge.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REGAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My sickness grows upon me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALBANY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She is not well; convey her to my tent.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit Regan, led</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>Enter a Herald</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Come hither, herald,--Let the trumpet sound,</LINE>
<LINE>And read out this.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Captain</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sound, trumpet!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>A trumpet sounds</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Herald</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Reads</STAGEDIR>  'If any man of quality or degree within</LINE>
<LINE>the lists of the army will maintain upon Edmund,</LINE>
<LINE>supposed Earl of Gloucester, that he is a manifold</LINE>
<LINE>traitor, let him appear by the third sound of the</LINE>
<LINE>trumpet: he is bold in his defence.'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDMUND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sound!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>First trumpet</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Herald</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Again!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Second trumpet</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Herald</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Again!</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Third trumpet</STAGEDIR>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Trumpet answers within</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>Enter EDGAR, at the third sound, armed, with a
trumpet before him</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALBANY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ask him his purposes, why he appears</LINE>
<LINE>Upon this call o' the trumpet.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Herald</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What are you?</LINE>
<LINE>Your name, your quality? and why you answer</LINE>
<LINE>This present summons?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDGAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Know, my name is lost;</LINE>
<LINE>By treason's tooth bare-gnawn and canker-bit:</LINE>
<LINE>Yet am I noble as the adversary</LINE>
<LINE>I come to cope.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALBANY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Which is that adversary?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDGAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What's he that speaks for Edmund Earl of Gloucester?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDMUND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Himself: what say'st thou to him?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDGAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Draw thy sword,</LINE>
<LINE>That, if my speech offend a noble heart,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy arm may do thee justice: here is mine.</LINE>
<LINE>Behold, it is the privilege of mine honours,</LINE>
<LINE>My oath, and my profession: I protest,</LINE>
<LINE>Maugre thy strength, youth, place, and eminence,</LINE>
<LINE>Despite thy victor sword and fire-new fortune,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy valour and thy heart, thou art a traitor;</LINE>
<LINE>False to thy gods, thy brother, and thy father;</LINE>
<LINE>Conspirant 'gainst this high-illustrious prince;</LINE>
<LINE>And, from the extremest upward of thy head</LINE>
<LINE>To the descent and dust below thy foot,</LINE>
<LINE>A most toad-spotted traitor. Say thou 'No,'</LINE>
<LINE>This sword, this arm, and my best spirits, are bent</LINE>
<LINE>To prove upon thy heart, whereto I speak,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou liest.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDMUND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In wisdom I should ask thy name;</LINE>
<LINE>But, since thy outside looks so fair and warlike,</LINE>
<LINE>And that thy tongue some say of breeding breathes,</LINE>
<LINE>What safe and nicely I might well delay</LINE>
<LINE>By rule of knighthood, I disdain and spurn:</LINE>
<LINE>Back do I toss these treasons to thy head;</LINE>
<LINE>With the hell-hated lie o'erwhelm thy heart;</LINE>
<LINE>Which, for they yet glance by and scarcely bruise,</LINE>
<LINE>This sword of mine shall give them instant way,</LINE>
<LINE>Where they shall rest for ever. Trumpets, speak!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Alarums. They fight. EDMUND falls</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALBANY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Save him, save him!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GONERIL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is practise, Gloucester:</LINE>
<LINE>By the law of arms thou wast not bound to answer</LINE>
<LINE>An unknown opposite; thou art not vanquish'd,</LINE>
<LINE>But cozen'd and beguiled.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALBANY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Shut your mouth, dame,</LINE>
<LINE>Or with this paper shall I stop it: Hold, sir:</LINE>
<LINE>Thou worse than any name, read thine own evil:</LINE>
<LINE>No tearing, lady: I perceive you know it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Gives the letter to EDMUND</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GONERIL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Say, if I do, the laws are mine, not thine:</LINE>
<LINE>Who can arraign me for't.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALBANY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Most monstrous! oh!</LINE>
<LINE>Know'st thou this paper?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GONERIL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ask me not what I know.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALBANY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go after her: she's desperate; govern her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDMUND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What you have charged me with, that have I done;</LINE>
<LINE>And more, much more; the time will bring it out:</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis past, and so am I. But what art thou</LINE>
<LINE>That hast this fortune on me? If thou'rt noble,</LINE>
<LINE>I do forgive thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDGAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let's exchange charity.</LINE>
<LINE>I am no less in blood than thou art, Edmund;</LINE>
<LINE>If more, the more thou hast wrong'd me.</LINE>
<LINE>My name is Edgar, and thy father's son.</LINE>
<LINE>The gods are just, and of our pleasant vices</LINE>
<LINE>Make instruments to plague us:</LINE>
<LINE>The dark and vicious place where thee he got</LINE>
<LINE>Cost him his eyes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDMUND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou hast spoken right, 'tis true;</LINE>
<LINE>The wheel is come full circle: I am here.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALBANY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Methought thy very gait did prophesy</LINE>
<LINE>A royal nobleness: I must embrace thee:</LINE>
<LINE>Let sorrow split my heart, if ever I</LINE>
<LINE>Did hate thee or thy father!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDGAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Worthy prince, I know't.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALBANY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where have you hid yourself?</LINE>
<LINE>How have you known the miseries of your father?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDGAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By nursing them, my lord. List a brief tale;</LINE>
<LINE>And when 'tis told, O, that my heart would burst!</LINE>
<LINE>The bloody proclamation to escape,</LINE>
<LINE>That follow'd me so near,--O, our lives' sweetness!</LINE>
<LINE>That we the pain of death would hourly die</LINE>
<LINE>Rather than die at once!--taught me to shift</LINE>
<LINE>Into a madman's rags; to assume a semblance</LINE>
<LINE>That very dogs disdain'd: and in this habit</LINE>
<LINE>Met I my father with his bleeding rings,</LINE>
<LINE>Their precious stones new lost: became his guide,</LINE>
<LINE>Led him, begg'd for him, saved him from despair;</LINE>
<LINE>Never,--O fault!--reveal'd myself unto him,</LINE>
<LINE>Until some half-hour past, when I was arm'd:</LINE>
<LINE>Not sure, though hoping, of this good success,</LINE>
<LINE>I ask'd his blessing, and from first to last</LINE>
<LINE>Told him my pilgrimage: but his flaw'd heart,</LINE>
<LINE>Alack, too weak the conflict to support!</LINE>
<LINE>'Twixt two extremes of passion, joy and grief,</LINE>
<LINE>Burst smilingly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDMUND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This speech of yours hath moved me,</LINE>
<LINE>And shall perchance do good: but speak you on;</LINE>
<LINE>You look as you had something more to say.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALBANY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If there be more, more woeful, hold it in;</LINE>
<LINE>For I am almost ready to dissolve,</LINE>
<LINE>Hearing of this.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDGAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This would have seem'd a period</LINE>
<LINE>To such as love not sorrow; but another,</LINE>
<LINE>To amplify too much, would make much more,</LINE>
<LINE>And top extremity.</LINE>
<LINE>Whilst I was big in clamour came there in a man,</LINE>
<LINE>Who, having seen me in my worst estate,</LINE>
<LINE>Shunn'd my abhorr'd society; but then, finding</LINE>
<LINE>Who 'twas that so endured, with his strong arms</LINE>
<LINE>He fastened on my neck, and bellow'd out</LINE>
<LINE>As he'ld burst heaven; threw him on my father;</LINE>
<LINE>Told the most piteous tale of Lear and him</LINE>
<LINE>That ever ear received: which in recounting</LINE>
<LINE>His grief grew puissant and the strings of life</LINE>
<LINE>Began to crack: twice then the trumpets sounded,</LINE>
<LINE>And there I left him tranced.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALBANY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But who was this?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDGAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Kent, sir, the banish'd Kent; who in disguise</LINE>
<LINE>Follow'd his enemy king, and did him service</LINE>
<LINE>Improper for a slave.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter a Gentleman, with a bloody knife</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Gentleman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Help, help, O, help!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDGAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What kind of help?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALBANY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Speak, man.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDGAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What means that bloody knife?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Gentleman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis hot, it smokes;</LINE>
<LINE>It came even from the heart of--O, she's dead!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALBANY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who dead? speak, man.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Gentleman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your lady, sir, your lady: and her sister</LINE>
<LINE>By her is poisoned; she hath confess'd it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDMUND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I was contracted to them both: all three</LINE>
<LINE>Now marry in an instant.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDGAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here comes Kent.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALBANY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Produce their bodies, be they alive or dead:</LINE>
<LINE>This judgment of the heavens, that makes us tremble,</LINE>
<LINE>Touches us not with pity.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit Gentleman</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>Enter KENT</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>O, is this he?</LINE>
<LINE>The time will not allow the compliment</LINE>
<LINE>Which very manners urges.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am come</LINE>
<LINE>To bid my king and master aye good night:</LINE>
<LINE>Is he not here?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALBANY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Great thing of us forgot!</LINE>
<LINE>Speak, Edmund, where's the king? and where's Cordelia?</LINE>
<LINE>See'st thou this object, Kent?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>The bodies of GONERIL and REGAN are brought in</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alack, why thus?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDMUND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yet Edmund was beloved:</LINE>
<LINE>The one the other poison'd for my sake,</LINE>
<LINE>And after slew herself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALBANY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Even so. Cover their faces.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDMUND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I pant for life: some good I mean to do,</LINE>
<LINE>Despite of mine own nature. Quickly send,</LINE>
<LINE>Be brief in it, to the castle; for my writ</LINE>
<LINE>Is on the life of Lear and on Cordelia:</LINE>
<LINE>Nay, send in time.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALBANY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Run, run, O, run!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDGAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To who, my lord? Who hath the office? send</LINE>
<LINE>Thy token of reprieve.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDMUND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well thought on: take my sword,</LINE>
<LINE>Give it the captain.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALBANY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Haste thee, for thy life.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit EDGAR</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDMUND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He hath commission from thy wife and me</LINE>
<LINE>To hang Cordelia in the prison, and</LINE>
<LINE>To lay the blame upon her own despair,</LINE>
<LINE>That she fordid herself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALBANY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The gods defend her! Bear him hence awhile.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>EDMUND is borne off</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>Re-enter KING LEAR, with CORDELIA dead in his arms;
EDGAR, Captain, and others following</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Howl, howl, howl, howl! O, you are men of stones:</LINE>
<LINE>Had I your tongues and eyes, I'ld use them so</LINE>
<LINE>That heaven's vault should crack. She's gone for ever!</LINE>
<LINE>I know when one is dead, and when one lives;</LINE>
<LINE>She's dead as earth. Lend me a looking-glass;</LINE>
<LINE>If that her breath will mist or stain the stone,</LINE>
<LINE>Why, then she lives.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is this the promised end</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDGAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Or image of that horror?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALBANY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fall, and cease!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This feather stirs; she lives! if it be so,</LINE>
<LINE>It is a chance which does redeem all sorrows</LINE>
<LINE>That ever I have felt.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Kneeling</STAGEDIR>  O my good master!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Prithee, away.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDGAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis noble Kent, your friend.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A plague upon you, murderers, traitors all!</LINE>
<LINE>I might have saved her; now she's gone for ever!</LINE>
<LINE>Cordelia, Cordelia! stay a little. Ha!</LINE>
<LINE>What is't thou say'st? Her voice was ever soft,</LINE>
<LINE>Gentle, and low, an excellent thing in woman.</LINE>
<LINE>I kill'd the slave that was a-hanging thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Captain</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis true, my lords, he did.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Did I not, fellow?</LINE>
<LINE>I have seen the day, with my good biting falchion</LINE>
<LINE>I would have made them skip: I am old now,</LINE>
<LINE>And these same crosses spoil me. Who are you?</LINE>
<LINE>Mine eyes are not o' the best: I'll tell you straight.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If fortune brag of two she loved and hated,</LINE>
<LINE>One of them we behold.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is a dull sight. Are you not Kent?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The same,</LINE>
<LINE>Your servant Kent: Where is your servant Caius?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He's a good fellow, I can tell you that;</LINE>
<LINE>He'll strike, and quickly too: he's dead and rotten.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, my good lord; I am the very man,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll see that straight.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That, from your first of difference and decay,</LINE>
<LINE>Have follow'd your sad steps.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You are welcome hither.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nor no man else: all's cheerless, dark, and deadly.</LINE>
<LINE>Your eldest daughters have fordone them selves,</LINE>
<LINE>And desperately are dead.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, so I think.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALBANY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He knows not what he says: and vain it is</LINE>
<LINE>That we present us to him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDGAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Very bootless.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter a Captain</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Captain</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Edmund is dead, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALBANY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That's but a trifle here.</LINE>
<LINE>You lords and noble friends, know our intent.</LINE>
<LINE>What comfort to this great decay may come</LINE>
<LINE>Shall be applied: for us we will resign,</LINE>
<LINE>During the life of this old majesty,</LINE>
<LINE>To him our absolute power:</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>To EDGAR and KENT</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>you, to your rights:</LINE>
<LINE>With boot, and such addition as your honours</LINE>
<LINE>Have more than merited. All friends shall taste</LINE>
<LINE>The wages of their virtue, and all foes</LINE>
<LINE>The cup of their deservings. O, see, see!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING LEAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And my poor fool is hang'd! No, no, no life!</LINE>
<LINE>Why should a dog, a horse, a rat, have life,</LINE>
<LINE>And thou no breath at all? Thou'lt come no more,</LINE>
<LINE>Never, never, never, never, never!</LINE>
<LINE>Pray you, undo this button: thank you, sir.</LINE>
<LINE>Do you see this? Look on her, look, her lips,</LINE>
<LINE>Look there, look there!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Dies</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDGAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He faints! My lord, my lord!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Break, heart; I prithee, break!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDGAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Look up, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Vex not his ghost: O, let him pass! he hates him much</LINE>
<LINE>That would upon the rack of this tough world</LINE>
<LINE>Stretch him out longer.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDGAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He is gone, indeed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The wonder is, he hath endured so long:</LINE>
<LINE>He but usurp'd his life.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALBANY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Bear them from hence. Our present business</LINE>
<LINE>Is general woe.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>To KENT and EDGAR</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Friends of my soul, you twain</LINE>
<LINE>Rule in this realm, and the gored state sustain.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have a journey, sir, shortly to go;</LINE>
<LINE>My master calls me, I must not say no.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALBANY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The weight of this sad time we must obey;</LINE>
<LINE>Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say.</LINE>
<LINE>The oldest hath borne most: we that are young</LINE>
<LINE>Shall never see so much, nor live so long.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt, with a dead march</STAGEDIR>
