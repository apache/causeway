This catalog lists a number of extensions to the framework.
These typically are for use directly within by the domain application itself.

There are also a number of extensions documented elsewhere in other guides:

* in the xref:security:ROOT:about.adoc[security] guide, and the xref:vw:ROOT:about.adoc[wicket viewer] guide).
+
These extensions extend the capability of those components, or provide alternative implementations

* in the xref:testing:ROOT:about.adoc[testing] guide
+
The extensions here _are_ for use by the domain application, but only for testing or prototyping (eg fixtures) rather than in the business logic itself.
