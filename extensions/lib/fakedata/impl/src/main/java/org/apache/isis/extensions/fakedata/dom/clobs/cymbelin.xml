<STAGEDIR>Enter two Gentlemen</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Gentleman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You do not meet a man but frowns: our bloods</LINE>
<LINE>No more obey the heavens than our courtiers</LINE>
<LINE>Still seem as does the king.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Gentleman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But what's the matter?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Gentleman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>His daughter, and the heir of's kingdom, whom</LINE>
<LINE>He purposed to his wife's sole son--a widow</LINE>
<LINE>That late he married--hath referr'd herself</LINE>
<LINE>Unto a poor but worthy gentleman: she's wedded;</LINE>
<LINE>Her husband banish'd; she imprison'd: all</LINE>
<LINE>Is outward sorrow; though I think the king</LINE>
<LINE>Be touch'd at very heart.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Gentleman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>None but the king?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Gentleman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He that hath lost her too; so is the queen,</LINE>
<LINE>That most desired the match; but not a courtier,</LINE>
<LINE>Although they wear their faces to the bent</LINE>
<LINE>Of the king's look's, hath a heart that is not</LINE>
<LINE>Glad at the thing they scowl at.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Gentleman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And why so?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Gentleman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He that hath miss'd the princess is a thing</LINE>
<LINE>Too bad for bad report: and he that hath her--</LINE>
<LINE>I mean, that married her, alack, good man!</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore banish'd--is a creature such</LINE>
<LINE>As, to seek through the regions of the earth</LINE>
<LINE>For one his like, there would be something failing</LINE>
<LINE>In him that should compare. I do not think</LINE>
<LINE>So fair an outward and such stuff within</LINE>
<LINE>Endows a man but he.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Gentleman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You speak him far.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Gentleman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do extend him, sir, within himself,</LINE>
<LINE>Crush him together rather than unfold</LINE>
<LINE>His measure duly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Gentleman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What's his name and birth?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Gentleman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I cannot delve him to the root: his father</LINE>
<LINE>Was call'd Sicilius, who did join his honour</LINE>
<LINE>Against the Romans with Cassibelan,</LINE>
<LINE>But had his titles by Tenantius whom</LINE>
<LINE>He served with glory and admired success,</LINE>
<LINE>So gain'd the sur-addition Leonatus;</LINE>
<LINE>And had, besides this gentleman in question,</LINE>
<LINE>Two other sons, who in the wars o' the time</LINE>
<LINE>Died with their swords in hand; for which</LINE>
<LINE>their father,</LINE>
<LINE>Then old and fond of issue, took such sorrow</LINE>
<LINE>That he quit being, and his gentle lady,</LINE>
<LINE>Big of this gentleman our theme, deceased</LINE>
<LINE>As he was born. The king he takes the babe</LINE>
<LINE>To his protection, calls him Posthumus Leonatus,</LINE>
<LINE>Breeds him and makes him of his bed-chamber,</LINE>
<LINE>Puts to him all the learnings that his time</LINE>
<LINE>Could make him the receiver of; which he took,</LINE>
<LINE>As we do air, fast as 'twas minister'd,</LINE>
<LINE>And in's spring became a harvest, lived in court--</LINE>
<LINE>Which rare it is to do--most praised, most loved,</LINE>
<LINE>A sample to the youngest, to the more mature</LINE>
<LINE>A glass that feated them, and to the graver</LINE>
<LINE>A child that guided dotards; to his mistress,</LINE>
<LINE>For whom he now is banish'd, her own price</LINE>
<LINE>Proclaims how she esteem'd him and his virtue;</LINE>
<LINE>By her election may be truly read</LINE>
<LINE>What kind of man he is.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Gentleman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I honour him</LINE>
<LINE>Even out of your report. But, pray you, tell me,</LINE>
<LINE>Is she sole child to the king?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Gentleman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>His only child.</LINE>
<LINE>He had two sons: if this be worth your hearing,</LINE>
<LINE>Mark it: the eldest of them at three years old,</LINE>
<LINE>I' the swathing-clothes the other, from their nursery</LINE>
<LINE>Were stol'n, and to this hour no guess in knowledge</LINE>
<LINE>Which way they went.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Gentleman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How long is this ago?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Gentleman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Some twenty years.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Gentleman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That a king's children should be so convey'd,</LINE>
<LINE>So slackly guarded, and the search so slow,</LINE>
<LINE>That could not trace them!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Gentleman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Howsoe'er 'tis strange,</LINE>
<LINE>Or that the negligence may well be laugh'd at,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet is it true, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Gentleman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do well believe you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Gentleman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We must forbear: here comes the gentleman,</LINE>
<LINE>The queen, and princess.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>Enter the QUEEN, POSTHUMUS LEONATUS, and IMOGEN</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, be assured you shall not find me, daughter,</LINE>
<LINE>After the slander of most stepmothers,</LINE>
<LINE>Evil-eyed unto you: you're my prisoner, but</LINE>
<LINE>Your gaoler shall deliver you the keys</LINE>
<LINE>That lock up your restraint. For you, Posthumus,</LINE>
<LINE>So soon as I can win the offended king,</LINE>
<LINE>I will be known your advocate: marry, yet</LINE>
<LINE>The fire of rage is in him, and 'twere good</LINE>
<LINE>You lean'd unto his sentence with what patience</LINE>
<LINE>Your wisdom may inform you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Please your highness,</LINE>
<LINE>I will from hence to-day.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You know the peril.</LINE>
<LINE>I'll fetch a turn about the garden, pitying</LINE>
<LINE>The pangs of barr'd affections, though the king</LINE>
<LINE>Hath charged you should not speak together.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O</LINE>
<LINE>Dissembling courtesy! How fine this tyrant</LINE>
<LINE>Can tickle where she wounds! My dearest husband,</LINE>
<LINE>I something fear my father's wrath; but nothing--</LINE>
<LINE>Always reserved my holy duty--what</LINE>
<LINE>His rage can do on me: you must be gone;</LINE>
<LINE>And I shall here abide the hourly shot</LINE>
<LINE>Of angry eyes, not comforted to live,</LINE>
<LINE>But that there is this jewel in the world</LINE>
<LINE>That I may see again.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My queen! my mistress!</LINE>
<LINE>O lady, weep no more, lest I give cause</LINE>
<LINE>To be suspected of more tenderness</LINE>
<LINE>Than doth become a man. I will remain</LINE>
<LINE>The loyal'st husband that did e'er plight troth:</LINE>
<LINE>My residence in Rome at one Philario's,</LINE>
<LINE>Who to my father was a friend, to me</LINE>
<LINE>Known but by letter: thither write, my queen,</LINE>
<LINE>And with mine eyes I'll drink the words you send,</LINE>
<LINE>Though ink be made of gall.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Re-enter QUEEN</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Be brief, I pray you:</LINE>
<LINE>If the king come, I shall incur I know not</LINE>
<LINE>How much of his displeasure.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Yet I'll move him</LINE>
<LINE>To walk this way: I never do him wrong,</LINE>
<LINE>But he does buy my injuries, to be friends;</LINE>
<LINE>Pays dear for my offences.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Should we be taking leave</LINE>
<LINE>As long a term as yet we have to live,</LINE>
<LINE>The loathness to depart would grow. Adieu!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, stay a little:</LINE>
<LINE>Were you but riding forth to air yourself,</LINE>
<LINE>Such parting were too petty. Look here, love;</LINE>
<LINE>This diamond was my mother's: take it, heart;</LINE>
<LINE>But keep it till you woo another wife,</LINE>
<LINE>When Imogen is dead.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How, how! another?</LINE>
<LINE>You gentle gods, give me but this I have,</LINE>
<LINE>And sear up my embracements from a next</LINE>
<LINE>With bonds of death!</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Putting on the ring</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Remain, remain thou here</LINE>
<LINE>While sense can keep it on. And, sweetest, fairest,</LINE>
<LINE>As I my poor self did exchange for you,</LINE>
<LINE>To your so infinite loss, so in our trifles</LINE>
<LINE>I still win of you: for my sake wear this;</LINE>
<LINE>It is a manacle of love; I'll place it</LINE>
<LINE>Upon this fairest prisoner.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Putting a bracelet upon her arm</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O the gods!</LINE>
<LINE>When shall we see again?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter CYMBELINE and Lords</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alack, the king!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou basest thing, avoid! hence, from my sight!</LINE>
<LINE>If after this command thou fraught the court</LINE>
<LINE>With thy unworthiness, thou diest: away!</LINE>
<LINE>Thou'rt poison to my blood.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The gods protect you!</LINE>
<LINE>And bless the good remainders of the court! I am gone.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There cannot be a pinch in death</LINE>
<LINE>More sharp than this is.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O disloyal thing,</LINE>
<LINE>That shouldst repair my youth, thou heap'st</LINE>
<LINE>A year's age on me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I beseech you, sir,</LINE>
<LINE>Harm not yourself with your vexation</LINE>
<LINE>I am senseless of your wrath; a touch more rare</LINE>
<LINE>Subdues all pangs, all fears.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Past grace? obedience?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Past hope, and in despair; that way, past grace.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That mightst have had the sole son of my queen!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O blest, that I might not! I chose an eagle,</LINE>
<LINE>And did avoid a puttock.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou took'st a beggar; wouldst have made my throne</LINE>
<LINE>A seat for baseness.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No; I rather added</LINE>
<LINE>A lustre to it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O thou vile one!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir,</LINE>
<LINE>It is your fault that I have loved Posthumus:</LINE>
<LINE>You bred him as my playfellow, and he is</LINE>
<LINE>A man worth any woman, overbuys me</LINE>
<LINE>Almost the sum he pays.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, art thou mad?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Almost, sir: heaven restore me! Would I were</LINE>
<LINE>A neat-herd's daughter, and my Leonatus</LINE>
<LINE>Our neighbour shepherd's son!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou foolish thing!</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Re-enter QUEEN</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>They were again together: you have done</LINE>
<LINE>Not after our command. Away with her,</LINE>
<LINE>And pen her up.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Beseech your patience. Peace,</LINE>
<LINE>Dear lady daughter, peace! Sweet sovereign,</LINE>
<LINE>Leave us to ourselves; and make yourself some comfort</LINE>
<LINE>Out of your best advice.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, let her languish</LINE>
<LINE>A drop of blood a day; and, being aged,</LINE>
<LINE>Die of this folly!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt CYMBELINE and Lords</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fie! you must give way.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter PISANIO</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Here is your servant. How now, sir! What news?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PISANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord your son drew on my master.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ha!</LINE>
<LINE>No harm, I trust, is done?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PISANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There might have been,</LINE>
<LINE>But that my master rather play'd than fought</LINE>
<LINE>And had no help of anger: they were parted</LINE>
<LINE>By gentlemen at hand.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am very glad on't.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your son's my father's friend; he takes his part.</LINE>
<LINE>To draw upon an exile! O brave sir!</LINE>
<LINE>I would they were in Afric both together;</LINE>
<LINE>Myself by with a needle, that I might prick</LINE>
<LINE>The goer-back. Why came you from your master?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PISANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>On his command: he would not suffer me</LINE>
<LINE>To bring him to the haven; left these notes</LINE>
<LINE>Of what commands I should be subject to,</LINE>
<LINE>When 't pleased you to employ me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This hath been</LINE>
<LINE>Your faithful servant: I dare lay mine honour</LINE>
<LINE>He will remain so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PISANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I humbly thank your highness.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pray, walk awhile.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>About some half-hour hence,</LINE>
<LINE>I pray you, speak with me: you shall at least</LINE>
<LINE>Go see my lord aboard: for this time leave me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt</STAGEDIR>
</SCENE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE II.  The same. A public place.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter CLOTEN and two Lords</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, I would advise you to shift a shirt; the</LINE>
<LINE>violence of action hath made you reek as a</LINE>
<LINE>sacrifice: where air comes out, air comes in:</LINE>
<LINE>there's none abroad so wholesome as that you vent.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLOTEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If my shirt were bloody, then to shift it. Have I hurt him?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  No, 'faith; not so much as his patience.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hurt him! his body's a passable carcass, if he be</LINE>
<LINE>not hurt: it is a thoroughfare for steel, if it be not hurt.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  His steel was in debt; it went o' the</LINE>
<LINE>backside the town.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLOTEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The villain would not stand me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  No; but he fled forward still, toward your face.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Stand you! You have land enough of your own: but</LINE>
<LINE>he added to your having; gave you some ground.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  As many inches as you have oceans. Puppies!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLOTEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would they had not come between us.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  So would I, till you had measured how long</LINE>
<LINE>a fool you were upon the ground.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLOTEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And that she should love this fellow and refuse me!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  If it be a sin to make a true election, she</LINE>
<LINE>is damned.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, as I told you always, her beauty and her brain</LINE>
<LINE>go not together: she's a good sign, but I have seen</LINE>
<LINE>small reflection of her wit.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  She shines not upon fools, lest the</LINE>
<LINE>reflection should hurt her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLOTEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, I'll to my chamber. Would there had been some</LINE>
<LINE>hurt done!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  I wish not so; unless it had been the fall</LINE>
<LINE>of an ass, which is no great hurt.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLOTEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You'll go with us?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll attend your lordship.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLOTEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, come, let's go together.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt</STAGEDIR>
</SCENE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE III.  A room in Cymbeline's palace.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter IMOGEN and PISANIO</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would thou grew'st unto the shores o' the haven,</LINE>
<LINE>And question'dst every sail: if he should write</LINE>
<LINE>And not have it, 'twere a paper lost,</LINE>
<LINE>As offer'd mercy is. What was the last</LINE>
<LINE>That he spake to thee?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PISANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It was his queen, his queen!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then waved his handkerchief?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PISANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And kiss'd it, madam.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Senseless Linen! happier therein than I!</LINE>
<LINE>And that was all?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PISANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, madam; for so long</LINE>
<LINE>As he could make me with this eye or ear</LINE>
<LINE>Distinguish him from others, he did keep</LINE>
<LINE>The deck, with glove, or hat, or handkerchief,</LINE>
<LINE>Still waving, as the fits and stirs of 's mind</LINE>
<LINE>Could best express how slow his soul sail'd on,</LINE>
<LINE>How swift his ship.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou shouldst have made him</LINE>
<LINE>As little as a crow, or less, ere left</LINE>
<LINE>To after-eye him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PISANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam, so I did.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would have broke mine eye-strings; crack'd them, but</LINE>
<LINE>To look upon him, till the diminution</LINE>
<LINE>Of space had pointed him sharp as my needle,</LINE>
<LINE>Nay, follow'd him, till he had melted from</LINE>
<LINE>The smallness of a gnat to air, and then</LINE>
<LINE>Have turn'd mine eye and wept. But, good Pisanio,</LINE>
<LINE>When shall we hear from him?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PISANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Be assured, madam,</LINE>
<LINE>With his next vantage.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I did not take my leave of him, but had</LINE>
<LINE>Most pretty things to say: ere I could tell him</LINE>
<LINE>How I would think on him at certain hours</LINE>
<LINE>Such thoughts and such, or I could make him swear</LINE>
<LINE>The shes of Italy should not betray</LINE>
<LINE>Mine interest and his honour, or have charged him,</LINE>
<LINE>At the sixth hour of morn, at noon, at midnight,</LINE>
<LINE>To encounter me with orisons, for then</LINE>
<LINE>I am in heaven for him; or ere I could</LINE>
<LINE>Give him that parting kiss which I had set</LINE>
<LINE>Betwixt two charming words, comes in my father</LINE>
<LINE>And like the tyrannous breathing of the north</LINE>
<LINE>Shakes all our buds from growing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter a Lady</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Lady</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The queen, madam,</LINE>
<LINE>Desires your highness' company.</LINE>

<LINE>Those things I bid you do, get them dispatch'd.</LINE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE IV.  Rome. Philario's house.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter PHILARIO, IACHIMO, a Frenchman, a
Dutchman, and a Spaniard</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IACHIMO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Believe it, sir, I have seen him in Britain: he was</LINE>
<LINE>then of a crescent note, expected to prove so worthy</LINE>
<LINE>as since he hath been allowed the name of; but I</LINE>
<LINE>could then have looked on him without the help of</LINE>
<LINE>admiration, though the catalogue of his endowments</LINE>
<LINE>had been tabled by his side and I to peruse him by items.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PHILARIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You speak of him when he was less furnished than now</LINE>
<LINE>he is with that which makes him both without and within.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Frenchman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have seen him in France: we had very many there</LINE>
<LINE>could behold the sun with as firm eyes as he.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IACHIMO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This matter of marrying his king's daughter, wherein</LINE>
<LINE>he must be weighed rather by her value than his own,</LINE>
<LINE>words him, I doubt not, a great deal from the matter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Frenchman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And then his banishment.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IACHIMO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, and the approbation of those that weep this</LINE>
<LINE>lamentable divorce under her colours are wonderfully</LINE>
<LINE>to extend him; be it but to fortify her judgment,</LINE>
<LINE>which else an easy battery might lay flat, for</LINE>
<LINE>taking a beggar without less quality. But how comes</LINE>
<LINE>it he is to sojourn with you? How creeps</LINE>
<LINE>acquaintance?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PHILARIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>His father and I were soldiers together; to whom I</LINE>
<LINE>have been often bound for no less than my life.</LINE>
<LINE>Here comes the Briton: let him be so entertained</LINE>
<LINE>amongst you as suits, with gentlemen of your</LINE>
<LINE>knowing, to a stranger of his quality.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>I beseech you all, be better known to this</LINE>
<LINE>gentleman; whom I commend to you as a noble friend</LINE>
<LINE>of mine: how worthy he is I will leave to appear</LINE>
<LINE>hereafter, rather than story him in his own hearing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Frenchman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, we have known together in Orleans.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Since when I have been debtor to you for courtesies,</LINE>
<LINE>which I will be ever to pay and yet pay still.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Frenchman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, you o'er-rate my poor kindness: I was glad I</LINE>
<LINE>did atone my countryman and you; it had been pity</LINE>
<LINE>you should have been put together with so mortal a</LINE>
<LINE>purpose as then each bore, upon importance of so</LINE>
<LINE>slight and trivial a nature.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By your pardon, sir, I was then a young traveller;</LINE>
<LINE>rather shunned to go even with what I heard than in</LINE>
<LINE>my every action to be guided by others' experiences:</LINE>
<LINE>but upon my mended judgment--if I offend not to say</LINE>
<LINE>it is mended--my quarrel was not altogether slight.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Frenchman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Faith, yes, to be put to the arbitrement of swords,</LINE>
<LINE>and by such two that would by all likelihood have</LINE>
<LINE>confounded one the other, or have fallen both.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IACHIMO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Can we, with manners, ask what was the difference?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Frenchman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Safely, I think: 'twas a contention in public,</LINE>
<LINE>which may, without contradiction, suffer the report.</LINE>
<LINE>It was much like an argument that fell out last</LINE>
<LINE>night, where each of us fell in praise of our</LINE>
<LINE>country mistresses; this gentleman at that time</LINE>
<LINE>vouching--and upon warrant of bloody</LINE>
<LINE>affirmation--his to be more fair, virtuous, wise,</LINE>
<LINE>chaste, constant-qualified and less attemptable</LINE>
<LINE>than any the rarest of our ladies in France.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IACHIMO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That lady is not now living, or this gentleman's</LINE>
<LINE>opinion by this worn out.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She holds her virtue still and I my mind.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IACHIMO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You must not so far prefer her 'fore ours of Italy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Being so far provoked as I was in France, I would</LINE>
<LINE>abate her nothing, though I profess myself her</LINE>
<LINE>adorer, not her friend.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IACHIMO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As fair and as good--a kind of hand-in-hand</LINE>
<LINE>comparison--had been something too fair and too good</LINE>
<LINE>for any lady in Britain. If she went before others</LINE>
<LINE>I have seen, as that diamond of yours outlustres</LINE>
<LINE>many I have beheld. I could not but believe she</LINE>
<LINE>excelled many: but I have not seen the most</LINE>
<LINE>precious diamond that is, nor you the lady.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I praised her as I rated her: so do I my stone.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IACHIMO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What do you esteem it at?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>More than the world enjoys.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IACHIMO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Either your unparagoned mistress is dead, or she's</LINE>
<LINE>outprized by a trifle.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You are mistaken: the one may be sold, or given, if</LINE>
<LINE>there were wealth enough for the purchase, or merit</LINE>
<LINE>for the gift: the other is not a thing for sale,</LINE>
<LINE>and only the gift of the gods.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IACHIMO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Which the gods have given you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Which, by their graces, I will keep.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IACHIMO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You may wear her in title yours: but, you know,</LINE>
<LINE>strange fowl light upon neighbouring ponds. Your</LINE>
<LINE>ring may be stolen too: so your brace of unprizable</LINE>
<LINE>estimations; the one is but frail and the other</LINE>
<LINE>casual; a cunning thief, or a that way accomplished</LINE>
<LINE>courtier, would hazard the winning both of first and last.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your Italy contains none so accomplished a courtier</LINE>
<LINE>to convince the honour of my mistress, if, in the</LINE>
<LINE>holding or loss of that, you term her frail. I do</LINE>
<LINE>nothing doubt you have store of thieves;</LINE>
<LINE>notwithstanding, I fear not my ring.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PHILARIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let us leave here, gentlemen.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, with all my heart. This worthy signior, I</LINE>
<LINE>thank him, makes no stranger of me; we are familiar at first.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IACHIMO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With five times so much conversation, I should get</LINE>
<LINE>ground of your fair mistress, make her go back, even</LINE>
<LINE>to the yielding, had I admittance and opportunity to friend.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, no.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IACHIMO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I dare thereupon pawn the moiety of my estate to</LINE>
<LINE>your ring; which, in my opinion, o'ervalues it</LINE>
<LINE>something: but I make my wager rather against your</LINE>
<LINE>confidence than her reputation: and, to bar your</LINE>
<LINE>offence herein too, I durst attempt it against any</LINE>
<LINE>lady in the world.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You are a great deal abused in too bold a</LINE>
<LINE>persuasion; and I doubt not you sustain what you're</LINE>
<LINE>worthy of by your attempt.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IACHIMO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What's that?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A repulse: though your attempt, as you call it,</LINE>
<LINE>deserve more; a punishment too.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PHILARIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Gentlemen, enough of this: it came in too suddenly;</LINE>
<LINE>let it die as it was born, and, I pray you, be</LINE>
<LINE>better acquainted.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IACHIMO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Would I had put my estate and my neighbour's on the</LINE>
<LINE>approbation of what I have spoke!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What lady would you choose to assail?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IACHIMO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yours; whom in constancy you think stands so safe.</LINE>
<LINE>I will lay you ten thousand ducats to your ring,</LINE>
<LINE>that, commend me to the court where your lady is,</LINE>
<LINE>with no more advantage than the opportunity of a</LINE>
<LINE>second conference, and I will bring from thence</LINE>
<LINE>that honour of hers which you imagine so reserved.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will wage against your gold, gold to it: my ring</LINE>
<LINE>I hold dear as my finger; 'tis part of it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IACHIMO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You are afraid, and therein the wiser. If you buy</LINE>
<LINE>ladies' flesh at a million a dram, you cannot</LINE>
<LINE>preserve it from tainting: but I see you have some</LINE>
<LINE>religion in you, that you fear.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is but a custom in your tongue; you bear a</LINE>
<LINE>graver purpose, I hope.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IACHIMO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am the master of my speeches, and would undergo</LINE>
<LINE>what's spoken, I swear.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Will you? I shall but lend my diamond till your</LINE>
<LINE>return: let there be covenants drawn between's: my</LINE>
<LINE>mistress exceeds in goodness the hugeness of your</LINE>
<LINE>unworthy thinking: I dare you to this match: here's my ring.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PHILARIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will have it no lay.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IACHIMO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By the gods, it is one. If I bring you no</LINE>
<LINE>sufficient testimony that I have enjoyed the dearest</LINE>
<LINE>bodily part of your mistress, my ten thousand ducats</LINE>
<LINE>are yours; so is your diamond too: if I come off,</LINE>
<LINE>and leave her in such honour as you have trust in,</LINE>
<LINE>she your jewel, this your jewel, and my gold are</LINE>
<LINE>yours: provided I have your commendation for my more</LINE>
<LINE>free entertainment.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I embrace these conditions; let us have articles</LINE>
<LINE>betwixt us. Only, thus far you shall answer: if</LINE>
<LINE>you make your voyage upon her and give me directly</LINE>
<LINE>to understand you have prevailed, I am no further</LINE>
<LINE>your enemy; she is not worth our debate: if she</LINE>
<LINE>remain unseduced, you not making it appear</LINE>
<LINE>otherwise, for your ill opinion and the assault you</LINE>
<LINE>have made to her chastity you shall answer me with</LINE>
<LINE>your sword.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IACHIMO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your hand; a covenant: we will have these things set</LINE>
<LINE>down by lawful counsel, and straight away for</LINE>
<LINE>Britain, lest the bargain should catch cold and</LINE>
<LINE>starve: I will fetch my gold and have our two</LINE>
<LINE>wagers recorded.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Agreed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt POSTHUMUS LEONATUS and IACHIMO</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Frenchman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Will this hold, think you?</LINE>

<LINE>Pray, let us follow 'em.</LINE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE V.  Britain. A room in Cymbeline's palace.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter QUEEN, Ladies, and CORNELIUS</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Whiles yet the dew's on ground, gather those flowers;</LINE>
<LINE>Make haste: who has the note of them?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Lady</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I, madam.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Dispatch.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exeunt Ladies</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Now, master doctor, have you brought those drugs?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORNELIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pleaseth your highness, ay: here they are, madam:</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Presenting a small box</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>But I beseech your grace, without offence,--</LINE>
<LINE>My conscience bids me ask--wherefore you have</LINE>
<LINE>Commanded of me those most poisonous compounds,</LINE>
<LINE>Which are the movers of a languishing death;</LINE>
<LINE>But though slow, deadly?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I wonder, doctor,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou ask'st me such a question. Have I not been</LINE>
<LINE>Thy pupil long? Hast thou not learn'd me how</LINE>
<LINE>To make perfumes? distil? preserve? yea, so</LINE>
<LINE>That our great king himself doth woo me oft</LINE>
<LINE>For my confections? Having thus far proceeded,--</LINE>
<LINE>Unless thou think'st me devilish--is't not meet</LINE>
<LINE>That I did amplify my judgment in</LINE>
<LINE>Other conclusions? I will try the forces</LINE>
<LINE>Of these thy compounds on such creatures as</LINE>
<LINE>We count not worth the hanging, but none human,</LINE>
<LINE>To try the vigour of them and apply</LINE>
<LINE>Allayments to their act, and by them gather</LINE>
<LINE>Their several virtues and effects.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORNELIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your highness</LINE>
<LINE>Shall from this practise but make hard your heart:</LINE>
<LINE>Besides, the seeing these effects will be</LINE>
<LINE>Both noisome and infectious.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, content thee.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter PISANIO</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Here comes a flattering rascal; upon him</LINE>
<LINE>Will I first work: he's for his master,</LINE>
<LINE>An enemy to my son. How now, Pisanio!</LINE>
<LINE>Doctor, your service for this time is ended;</LINE>
<LINE>Take your own way.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORNELIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>          I do suspect you, madam;</LINE>
<LINE>But you shall do no harm.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>To PISANIO</STAGEDIR>            Hark thee, a word.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORNELIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  I do not like her. She doth think she has</LINE>
<LINE>Strange lingering poisons: I do know her spirit,</LINE>
<LINE>And will not trust one of her malice with</LINE>
<LINE>A drug of such damn'd nature. Those she has</LINE>
<LINE>Will stupefy and dull the sense awhile;</LINE>
<LINE>Which first, perchance, she'll prove on</LINE>
<LINE>cats and dogs,</LINE>
<LINE>Then afterward up higher: but there is</LINE>
<LINE>No danger in what show of death it makes,</LINE>
<LINE>More than the locking-up the spirits a time,</LINE>
<LINE>To be more fresh, reviving. She is fool'd</LINE>
<LINE>With a most false effect; and I the truer,</LINE>
<LINE>So to be false with her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No further service, doctor,</LINE>
<LINE>Until I send for thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORNELIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I humbly take my leave.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Weeps she still, say'st thou? Dost thou think in time</LINE>
<LINE>She will not quench and let instructions enter</LINE>
<LINE>Where folly now possesses? Do thou work:</LINE>
<LINE>When thou shalt bring me word she loves my son,</LINE>
<LINE>I'll tell thee on the instant thou art then</LINE>
<LINE>As great as is thy master, greater, for</LINE>
<LINE>His fortunes all lie speechless and his name</LINE>
<LINE>Is at last gasp: return he cannot, nor</LINE>
<LINE>Continue where he is: to shift his being</LINE>
<LINE>Is to exchange one misery with another,</LINE>
<LINE>And every day that comes comes to decay</LINE>
<LINE>A day's work in him. What shalt thou expect,</LINE>
<LINE>To be depender on a thing that leans,</LINE>
<LINE>Who cannot be new built, nor has no friends,</LINE>
<LINE>So much as but to prop him?</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>The QUEEN drops the box: PISANIO takes it up</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Thou takest up</LINE>
<LINE>Thou know'st not what; but take it for thy labour:</LINE>
<LINE>It is a thing I made, which hath the king</LINE>
<LINE>Five times redeem'd from death: I do not know</LINE>
<LINE>What is more cordial. Nay, I prethee, take it;</LINE>
<LINE>It is an earnest of a further good</LINE>
<LINE>That I mean to thee. Tell thy mistress how</LINE>
<LINE>The case stands with her; do't as from thyself.</LINE>
<LINE>Think what a chance thou changest on, but think</LINE>
<LINE>Thou hast thy mistress still, to boot, my son,</LINE>
<LINE>Who shall take notice of thee: I'll move the king</LINE>
<LINE>To any shape of thy preferment such</LINE>
<LINE>As thou'lt desire; and then myself, I chiefly,</LINE>
<LINE>That set thee on to this desert, am bound</LINE>
<LINE>To load thy merit richly. Call my women:</LINE>
<LINE>Think on my words.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit PISANIO</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>A sly and constant knave,</LINE>
<LINE>Not to be shaked; the agent for his master</LINE>
<LINE>And the remembrancer of her to hold</LINE>
<LINE>The hand-fast to her lord. I have given him that</LINE>
<LINE>Which, if he take, shall quite unpeople her</LINE>
<LINE>Of liegers for her sweet, and which she after,</LINE>
<LINE>Except she bend her humour, shall be assured</LINE>
<LINE>To taste of too.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Re-enter PISANIO and Ladies</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>So, so: well done, well done:</LINE>
<LINE>The violets, cowslips, and the primroses,</LINE>
<LINE>Bear to my closet. Fare thee well, Pisanio;</LINE>
<LINE>Think on my words.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt QUEEN and Ladies</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PISANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And shall do:</LINE>

<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A father cruel, and a step-dame false;</LINE>
<LINE>A foolish suitor to a wedded lady,</LINE>
<LINE>That hath her husband banish'd;--O, that husband!</LINE>
<LINE>My supreme crown of grief! and those repeated</LINE>
<LINE>Vexations of it! Had I been thief-stol'n,</LINE>
<LINE>As my two brothers, happy! but most miserable</LINE>
<LINE>Is the desire that's glorious: blest be those,</LINE>
<LINE>How mean soe'er, that have their honest wills,</LINE>

<LINE>Thanks, good sir:</LINE>
<LINE>You're kindly welcome.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>IACHIMO</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  All of her that is out of door most rich!</LINE>
<LINE>If she be furnish'd with a mind so rare,</LINE>
<LINE>She is alone the Arabian bird, and I</LINE>

<LINE>Arm me, audacity, from head to foot!</LINE>
<LINE>Or, like the Parthian, I shall flying fight;</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IACHIMO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thanks, fairest lady.</LINE>
<LINE>What, are men mad? Hath nature given them eyes</LINE>

<LINE>Of sea and land, which can distinguish 'twixt</LINE>

<LINE>For idiots in this case of favour would</LINE>

<LINE>The cloyed will,</LINE>
<LINE>That satiate yet unsatisfied desire, that tub</LINE>
<LINE>Both fill'd and running, ravening first the lamb</LINE>
<LINE>Longs after for the garbage.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, dear sir,</LINE>
<LINE>Thus raps you? Are you well?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IACHIMO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thanks, madam; well.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>To PISANIO</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Beseech you, sir, desire</LINE>
<LINE>My man's abode where I did leave him: he</LINE>
<LINE>Is strange and peevish.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PISANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I was going, sir,</LINE>
<LINE>To give him welcome.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Continues well my lord? His health, beseech you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IACHIMO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, madam.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is he disposed to mirth? I hope he is.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IACHIMO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Exceeding pleasant; none a stranger there</LINE>
<LINE>So merry and so gamesome: he is call'd</LINE>
<LINE>The Briton reveller.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>When he was here,</LINE>
<LINE>He did incline to sadness, and oft-times</LINE>
<LINE>Not knowing why.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IACHIMO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I never saw him sad.</LINE>
<LINE>There is a Frenchman his companion, one</LINE>
<LINE>An eminent monsieur, that, it seems, much loves</LINE>
<LINE>A Gallian girl at home; he furnaces</LINE>
<LINE>The thick sighs from him, whiles the jolly Briton--</LINE>
<LINE>Your lord, I mean--laughs from's free lungs, cries 'O,</LINE>
<LINE>Can my sides hold, to think that man, who knows</LINE>
<LINE>By history, report, or his own proof,</LINE>
<LINE>What woman is, yea, what she cannot choose</LINE>
<LINE>But must be, will his free hours languish for</LINE>
<LINE>Assured bondage?'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Will my lord say so?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IACHIMO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, madam, with his eyes in flood with laughter:</LINE>
<LINE>It is a recreation to be by</LINE>
<LINE>And hear him mock the Frenchman. But, heavens know,</LINE>
<LINE>Some men are much to blame.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not he, I hope.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IACHIMO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not he: but yet heaven's bounty towards him might</LINE>
<LINE>Be used more thankfully. In himself, 'tis much;</LINE>
<LINE>In you, which I account his beyond all talents,</LINE>
<LINE>Whilst I am bound to wonder, I am bound</LINE>
<LINE>To pity too.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What do you pity, sir?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IACHIMO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Two creatures heartily.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Am I one, sir?</LINE>
<LINE>You look on me: what wreck discern you in me</LINE>
<LINE>Deserves your pity?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IACHIMO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lamentable! What,</LINE>
<LINE>To hide me from the radiant sun and solace</LINE>
<LINE>I' the dungeon by a snuff?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I pray you, sir,</LINE>
<LINE>Deliver with more openness your answers</LINE>
<LINE>To my demands. Why do you pity me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IACHIMO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That others do--</LINE>
<LINE>I was about to say--enjoy your--But</LINE>
<LINE>It is an office of the gods to venge it,</LINE>
<LINE>Not mine to speak on 't.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You do seem to know</LINE>
<LINE>Something of me, or what concerns me: pray you,--</LINE>
<LINE>Since doubling things go ill often hurts more</LINE>
<LINE>Than to be sure they do; for certainties</LINE>
<LINE>Either are past remedies, or, timely knowing,</LINE>
<LINE>The remedy then born--discover to me</LINE>
<LINE>What both you spur and stop.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IACHIMO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Had I this cheek</LINE>
<LINE>To bathe my lips upon; this hand, whose touch,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose every touch, would force the feeler's soul</LINE>
<LINE>To the oath of loyalty; this object, which</LINE>
<LINE>Takes prisoner the wild motion of mine eye,</LINE>
<LINE>Fixing it only here; should I, damn'd then,</LINE>
<LINE>Slaver with lips as common as the stairs</LINE>
<LINE>That mount the Capitol; join gripes with hands</LINE>
<LINE>Made hard with hourly falsehood--falsehood, as</LINE>
<LINE>With labour; then by-peeping in an eye</LINE>
<LINE>Base and unlustrous as the smoky light</LINE>
<LINE>That's fed with stinking tallow; it were fit</LINE>
<LINE>That all the plagues of hell should at one time</LINE>
<LINE>Encounter such revolt.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, I fear,</LINE>
<LINE>Has forgot Britain.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IACHIMO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And himself. Not I,</LINE>
<LINE>Inclined to this intelligence, pronounce</LINE>
<LINE>The beggary of his change; but 'tis your graces</LINE>
<LINE>That from pay mutest conscience to my tongue</LINE>
<LINE>Charms this report out.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let me hear no more.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IACHIMO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O dearest soul! your cause doth strike my heart</LINE>
<LINE>With pity, that doth make me sick. A lady</LINE>
<LINE>So fair, and fasten'd to an empery,</LINE>
<LINE>Would make the great'st king double,--to be partner'd</LINE>
<LINE>With tomboys hired with that self-exhibition</LINE>
<LINE>Which your own coffers yield! with diseased ventures</LINE>
<LINE>That play with all infirmities for gold</LINE>
<LINE>Which rottenness can lend nature! such boil'd stuff</LINE>
<LINE>As well might poison poison! Be revenged;</LINE>
<LINE>Or she that bore you was no queen, and you</LINE>
<LINE>Recoil from your great stock.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Revenged!</LINE>
<LINE>How should I be revenged? If this be true,--</LINE>
<LINE>As I have such a heart that both mine ears</LINE>
<LINE>Must not in haste abuse--if it be true,</LINE>
<LINE>How should I be revenged?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IACHIMO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Should he make me</LINE>
<LINE>Live, like Diana's priest, betwixt cold sheets,</LINE>
<LINE>Whiles he is vaulting variable ramps,</LINE>
<LINE>In your despite, upon your purse? Revenge it.</LINE>
<LINE>I dedicate myself to your sweet pleasure,</LINE>
<LINE>More noble than that runagate to your bed,</LINE>
<LINE>And will continue fast to your affection,</LINE>
<LINE>Still close as sure.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, ho, Pisanio!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IACHIMO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let me my service tender on your lips.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Away! I do condemn mine ears that have</LINE>
<LINE>So long attended thee. If thou wert honourable,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou wouldst have told this tale for virtue, not</LINE>
<LINE>For such an end thou seek'st,--as base as strange.</LINE>
<LINE>Thou wrong'st a gentleman, who is as far</LINE>
<LINE>From thy report as thou from honour, and</LINE>
<LINE>Solicit'st here a lady that disdains</LINE>
<LINE>Thee and the devil alike. What ho, Pisanio!</LINE>
<LINE>The king my father shall be made acquainted</LINE>
<LINE>Of thy assault: if he shall think it fit,</LINE>
<LINE>A saucy stranger in his court to mart</LINE>
<LINE>As in a Romish stew and to expound</LINE>
<LINE>His beastly mind to us, he hath a court</LINE>
<LINE>He little cares for and a daughter who</LINE>
<LINE>He not respects at all. What, ho, Pisanio!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IACHIMO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O happy Leonatus! I may say</LINE>
<LINE>The credit that thy lady hath of thee</LINE>
<LINE>Deserves thy trust, and thy most perfect goodness</LINE>
<LINE>Her assured credit. Blessed live you long!</LINE>
<LINE>A lady to the worthiest sir that ever</LINE>
<LINE>Country call'd his! and you his mistress, only</LINE>
<LINE>For the most worthiest fit! Give me your pardon.</LINE>
<LINE>I have spoke this, to know if your affiance</LINE>
<LINE>Were deeply rooted; and shall make your lord,</LINE>
<LINE>That which he is, new o'er: and he is one</LINE>
<LINE>The truest manner'd; such a holy witch</LINE>
<LINE>That he enchants societies into him;</LINE>
<LINE>Half all men's hearts are his.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You make amends.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IACHIMO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He sits 'mongst men like a descended god:</LINE>
<LINE>He hath a kind of honour sets him off,</LINE>
<LINE>More than a mortal seeming. Be not angry,</LINE>
<LINE>Most mighty princess, that I have adventured</LINE>
<LINE>To try your taking a false report; which hath</LINE>
<LINE>Honour'd with confirmation your great judgment</LINE>
<LINE>In the election of a sir so rare,</LINE>
<LINE>Which you know cannot err: the love I bear him</LINE>
<LINE>Made me to fan you thus, but the gods made you,</LINE>
<LINE>Unlike all others, chaffless. Pray, your pardon.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>All's well, sir: take my power i' the court</LINE>
<LINE>for yours.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IACHIMO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My humble thanks. I had almost forgot</LINE>
<LINE>To entreat your grace but in a small request,</LINE>
<LINE>And yet of moment to, for it concerns</LINE>
<LINE>Your lord; myself and other noble friends,</LINE>
<LINE>Are partners in the business.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pray, what is't?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IACHIMO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Some dozen Romans of us and your lord--</LINE>
<LINE>The best feather of our wing--have mingled sums</LINE>
<LINE>To buy a present for the emperor</LINE>
<LINE>Which I, the factor for the rest, have done</LINE>
<LINE>In France: 'tis plate of rare device, and jewels</LINE>
<LINE>Of rich and exquisite form; their values great;</LINE>
<LINE>And I am something curious, being strange,</LINE>
<LINE>To have them in safe stowage: may it please you</LINE>
<LINE>To take them in protection?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Willingly;</LINE>
<LINE>And pawn mine honour for their safety: since</LINE>
<LINE>My lord hath interest in them, I will keep them</LINE>
<LINE>In my bedchamber.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IACHIMO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They are in a trunk,</LINE>
<LINE>Attended by my men: I will make bold</LINE>
<LINE>To send them to you, only for this night;</LINE>
<LINE>I must aboard to-morrow.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, no, no.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IACHIMO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, I beseech; or I shall short my word</LINE>
<LINE>By lengthening my return. From Gallia</LINE>
<LINE>I cross'd the seas on purpose and on promise</LINE>
<LINE>To see your grace.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I thank you for your pains:</LINE>
<LINE>But not away to-morrow!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IACHIMO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, I must, madam:</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore I shall beseech you, if you please</LINE>
<LINE>To greet your lord with writing, do't to-night:</LINE>
<LINE>I have outstood my time; which is material</LINE>
<LINE>To the tender of our present.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will write.</LINE>
<LINE>Send your trunk to me; it shall safe be kept,</LINE>
<LINE>And truly yielded you. You're very welcome.</LINE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE I.  Britain. Before Cymbeline's palace.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter CLOTEN and two Lords</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLOTEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Was there ever man had such luck! when I kissed the</LINE>
<LINE>jack, upon an up-cast to be hit away! I had a</LINE>
<LINE>hundred pound on't: and then a whoreson jackanapes</LINE>
<LINE>must take me up for swearing; as if I borrowed mine</LINE>
<LINE>oaths of him and might not spend them at my pleasure.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What got he by that? You have broke his pate with</LINE>
<LINE>your bowl.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  If his wit had been like him that broke it,</LINE>
<LINE>it would have run all out.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLOTEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>When a gentleman is disposed to swear, it is not for</LINE>
<LINE>any standers-by to curtail his oaths, ha?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No my lord;</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>nor crop the ears of them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLOTEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Whoreson dog! I give him satisfaction?</LINE>
<LINE>Would he had been one of my rank!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  To have smelt like a fool.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLOTEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am not vexed more at any thing in the earth: a</LINE>
<LINE>pox on't! I had rather not be so noble as I am;</LINE>
<LINE>they dare not fight with me, because of the queen my</LINE>
<LINE>mother: every Jack-slave hath his bellyful of</LINE>
<LINE>fighting, and I must go up and down like a cock that</LINE>
<LINE>nobody can match.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  You are cock and capon too; and you crow,</LINE>
<LINE>cock, with your comb on.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLOTEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sayest thou?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is not fit your lordship should undertake every</LINE>
<LINE>companion that you give offence to.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLOTEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, I know that: but it is fit I should commit</LINE>
<LINE>offence to my inferiors.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, it is fit for your lordship only.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLOTEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, so I say.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Did you hear of a stranger that's come to court to-night?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLOTEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A stranger, and I not know on't!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  He's a strange fellow himself, and knows it</LINE>
<LINE>not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There's an Italian come; and, 'tis thought, one of</LINE>
<LINE>Leonatus' friends.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLOTEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Leonatus! a banished rascal; and he's another,</LINE>
<LINE>whatsoever he be. Who told you of this stranger?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>One of your lordship's pages.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLOTEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is it fit I went to look upon him? is there no</LINE>
<LINE>derogation in't?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You cannot derogate, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLOTEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not easily, I think.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  You are a fool granted; therefore your</LINE>
<LINE>issues, being foolish, do not derogate.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLOTEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, I'll go see this Italian: what I have lost</LINE>
<LINE>to-day at bowls I'll win to-night of him. Come, go.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll attend your lordship.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exeunt CLOTEN and First Lord</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>That such a crafty devil as is his mother</LINE>
<LINE>Should yield the world this ass! a woman that</LINE>
<LINE>Bears all down with her brain; and this her son</LINE>
<LINE>Cannot take two from twenty, for his heart,</LINE>
<LINE>And leave eighteen. Alas, poor princess,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou divine Imogen, what thou endurest,</LINE>
<LINE>Betwixt a father by thy step-dame govern'd,</LINE>
<LINE>A mother hourly coining plots, a wooer</LINE>
<LINE>More hateful than the foul expulsion is</LINE>
<LINE>Of thy dear husband, than that horrid act</LINE>
<LINE>Of the divorce he'ld make! The heavens hold firm</LINE>
<LINE>The walls of thy dear honour, keep unshaked</LINE>
<LINE>That temple, thy fair mind, that thou mayst stand,</LINE>
<LINE>To enjoy thy banish'd lord and this great land!</LINE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE II.  Imogen's bedchamber in Cymbeline's palace: a trunk in one corner of it.</TITLE>

<STAGEDIR>IMOGEN in bed, reading; a Lady attending</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who's there? my woman Helen?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Lady</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Please you, madam</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What hour is it?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Lady</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Almost midnight, madam.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have read three hours then: mine eyes are weak:</LINE>
<LINE>Fold down the leaf where I have left: to bed:</LINE>
<LINE>Take not away the taper, leave it burning;</LINE>
<LINE>And if thou canst awake by four o' the clock,</LINE>
<LINE>I prithee, call me. Sleep hath seized me wholly</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit Lady</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>To your protection I commend me, gods.</LINE>
<LINE>From fairies and the tempters of the night</LINE>
<LINE>Guard me, beseech ye.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Sleeps. IACHIMO comes from the trunk</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IACHIMO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The crickets sing, and man's o'er-labour'd sense</LINE>
<LINE>Repairs itself by rest. Our Tarquin thus</LINE>
<LINE>Did softly press the rushes, ere he waken'd</LINE>
<LINE>The chastity he wounded. Cytherea,</LINE>
<LINE>How bravely thou becomest thy bed, fresh lily,</LINE>
<LINE>And whiter than the sheets! That I might touch!</LINE>
<LINE>But kiss; one kiss! Rubies unparagon'd,</LINE>
<LINE>How dearly they do't! 'Tis her breathing that</LINE>
<LINE>Perfumes the chamber thus: the flame o' the taper</LINE>
<LINE>Bows toward her, and would under-peep her lids,</LINE>
<LINE>To see the enclosed lights, now canopied</LINE>
<LINE>Under these windows, white and azure laced</LINE>
<LINE>With blue of heaven's own tinct. But my design,</LINE>
<LINE>To note the chamber: I will write all down:</LINE>
<LINE>Such and such pictures; there the window; such</LINE>
<LINE>The adornment of her bed; the arras; figures,</LINE>
<LINE>Why, such and such; and the contents o' the story.</LINE>
<LINE>Ah, but some natural notes about her body,</LINE>
<LINE>Above ten thousand meaner moveables</LINE>
<LINE>Would testify, to enrich mine inventory.</LINE>
<LINE>O sleep, thou ape of death, lie dull upon her!</LINE>
<LINE>And be her sense but as a monument,</LINE>
<LINE>Thus in a chapel lying! Come off, come off:</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Taking off her bracelet</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>As slippery as the Gordian knot was hard!</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis mine; and this will witness outwardly,</LINE>
<LINE>As strongly as the conscience does within,</LINE>
<LINE>To the madding of her lord. On her left breast</LINE>
<LINE>A mole cinque-spotted, like the crimson drops</LINE>
<LINE>I' the bottom of a cowslip: here's a voucher,</LINE>
<LINE>Stronger than ever law could make: this secret</LINE>
<LINE>Will force him think I have pick'd the lock and ta'en</LINE>
<LINE>The treasure of her honour. No more. To what end?</LINE>
<LINE>Why should I write this down, that's riveted,</LINE>
<LINE>Screw'd to my memory? She hath been reading late</LINE>
<LINE>The tale of Tereus; here the leaf's turn'd down</LINE>
<LINE>Where Philomel gave up. I have enough:</LINE>
<LINE>To the trunk again, and shut the spring of it.</LINE>
<LINE>Swift, swift, you dragons of the night, that dawning</LINE>
<LINE>May bare the raven's eye! I lodge in fear;</LINE>
<LINE>Though this a heavenly angel, hell is here.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Clock strikes</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>One, two, three: time, time!</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Goes into the trunk. The scene closes</STAGEDIR>

<TITLE>Scene III  An ante-chamber adjoining Imogen's apartments.</TITLE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter CLOTEN and Lords</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your lordship is the most patient man in loss, the</LINE>
<LINE>most coldest that ever turned up ace.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLOTEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It would make any man cold to lose.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But not every man patient after the noble temper of</LINE>
<LINE>your lordship. You are most hot and furious when you win.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLOTEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Winning will put any man into courage. If I could</LINE>
<LINE>get this foolish Imogen, I should have gold enough.</LINE>
<LINE>It's almost morning, is't not?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Day, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLOTEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would this music would come: I am advised to give</LINE>
<LINE>her music o' mornings; they say it will penetrate.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter Musicians</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Come on; tune: if you can penetrate her with your</LINE>
<LINE>fingering, so; we'll try with tongue too: if none</LINE>
<LINE>will do, let her remain; but I'll never give o'er.</LINE>
<LINE>First, a very excellent good-conceited thing;</LINE>
<LINE>after, a wonderful sweet air, with admirable rich</LINE>
<LINE>words to it: and then let her consider.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>SONG</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Hark, hark! the lark at heaven's gate sings,</LINE>
<LINE>And Phoebus 'gins arise,</LINE>
<LINE>His steeds to water at those springs</LINE>
<LINE>On chaliced flowers that lies;</LINE>
<LINE>And winking Mary-buds begin</LINE>
<LINE>To ope their golden eyes:</LINE>
<LINE>With every thing that pretty is,</LINE>
<LINE>My lady sweet, arise:</LINE>
<LINE>Arise, arise.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLOTEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So, get you gone. If this penetrate, I will</LINE>
<LINE>consider your music the better: if it do not, it is</LINE>
<LINE>a vice in her ears, which horse-hairs and</LINE>
<LINE>calves'-guts, nor the voice of unpaved eunuch to</LINE>
<LINE>boot, can never amend.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt Musicians</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here comes the king.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLOTEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am glad I was up so late; for that's the reason I</LINE>
<LINE>was up so early: he cannot choose but take this</LINE>
<LINE>service I have done fatherly.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter CYMBELINE and QUEEN</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Good morrow to your majesty and to my gracious mother.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Attend you here the door of our stern daughter?</LINE>
<LINE>Will she not forth?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLOTEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have assailed her with music, but she vouchsafes no notice.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The exile of her minion is too new;</LINE>
<LINE>She hath not yet forgot him: some more time</LINE>
<LINE>Must wear the print of his remembrance out,</LINE>
<LINE>And then she's yours.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You are most bound to the king,</LINE>
<LINE>Who lets go by no vantages that may</LINE>
<LINE>Prefer you to his daughter. Frame yourself</LINE>
<LINE>To orderly soliciting, and be friended</LINE>
<LINE>With aptness of the season; make denials</LINE>
<LINE>Increase your services; so seem as if</LINE>
<LINE>You were inspired to do those duties which</LINE>
<LINE>You tender to her; that you in all obey her,</LINE>
<LINE>Save when command to your dismission tends,</LINE>
<LINE>And therein you are senseless.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLOTEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Senseless! not so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter a Messenger</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So like you, sir, ambassadors from Rome;</LINE>
<LINE>The one is Caius Lucius.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A worthy fellow,</LINE>
<LINE>Albeit he comes on angry purpose now;</LINE>
<LINE>But that's no fault of his: we must receive him</LINE>
<LINE>According to the honour of his sender;</LINE>
<LINE>And towards himself, his goodness forespent on us,</LINE>
<LINE>We must extend our notice. Our dear son,</LINE>
<LINE>When you have given good morning to your mistress,</LINE>
<LINE>Attend the queen and us; we shall have need</LINE>
<LINE>To employ you towards this Roman. Come, our queen.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt all but CLOTEN</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLOTEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If she be up, I'll speak with her; if not,</LINE>
<LINE>Let her lie still and dream.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Knocks</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>By your leave, ho!</LINE>
<LINE>I Know her women are about her: what</LINE>
<LINE>If I do line one of their hands? 'Tis gold</LINE>
<LINE>Which buys admittance; oft it doth; yea, and makes</LINE>
<LINE>Diana's rangers false themselves, yield up</LINE>
<LINE>Their deer to the stand o' the stealer; and 'tis gold</LINE>
<LINE>Which makes the true man kill'd and saves the thief;</LINE>
<LINE>Nay, sometime hangs both thief and true man: what</LINE>
<LINE>Can it not do and undo? I will make</LINE>
<LINE>One of her women lawyer to me, for</LINE>
<LINE>I yet not understand the case myself.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Knocks</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>By your leave.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter a Lady</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Lady</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who's there that knocks?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLOTEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A gentleman.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Lady</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No more?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLOTEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, and a gentlewoman's son.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Lady</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That's more</LINE>
<LINE>Than some, whose tailors are as dear as yours,</LINE>
<LINE>Can justly boast of. What's your lordship's pleasure?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLOTEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your lady's person: is she ready?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Lady</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay,</LINE>
<LINE>To keep her chamber.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLOTEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There is gold for you;</LINE>
<LINE>Sell me your good report.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Lady</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How! my good name? or to report of you</LINE>
<LINE>What I shall think is good?--The princess!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter IMOGEN</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLOTEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good morrow, fairest: sister, your sweet hand.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit Lady</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good morrow, sir. You lay out too much pains</LINE>
<LINE>For purchasing but trouble; the thanks I give</LINE>
<LINE>Is telling you that I am poor of thanks</LINE>
<LINE>And scarce can spare them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLOTEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Still, I swear I love you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If you but said so, 'twere as deep with me:</LINE>
<LINE>If you swear still, your recompense is still</LINE>
<LINE>That I regard it not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLOTEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is no answer.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But that you shall not say I yield being silent,</LINE>
<LINE>I would not speak. I pray you, spare me: 'faith,</LINE>
<LINE>I shall unfold equal discourtesy</LINE>
<LINE>To your best kindness: one of your great knowing</LINE>
<LINE>Should learn, being taught, forbearance.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLOTEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To leave you in your madness, 'twere my sin:</LINE>
<LINE>I will not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fools are not mad folks.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLOTEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do you call me fool?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As I am mad, I do:</LINE>
<LINE>If you'll be patient, I'll no more be mad;</LINE>
<LINE>That cures us both. I am much sorry, sir,</LINE>
<LINE>You put me to forget a lady's manners,</LINE>
<LINE>By being so verbal: and learn now, for all,</LINE>
<LINE>That I, which know my heart, do here pronounce,</LINE>
<LINE>By the very truth of it, I care not for you,</LINE>
<LINE>And am so near the lack of charity--</LINE>
<LINE>To accuse myself--I hate you; which I had rather</LINE>
<LINE>You felt than make't my boast.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLOTEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You sin against</LINE>
<LINE>Obedience, which you owe your father. For</LINE>
<LINE>The contract you pretend with that base wretch,</LINE>
<LINE>One bred of alms and foster'd with cold dishes,</LINE>
<LINE>With scraps o' the court, it is no contract, none:</LINE>
<LINE>And though it be allow'd in meaner parties--</LINE>
<LINE>Yet who than he more mean?--to knit their souls,</LINE>
<LINE>On whom there is no more dependency</LINE>
<LINE>But brats and beggary, in self-figured knot;</LINE>
<LINE>Yet you are curb'd from that enlargement by</LINE>
<LINE>The consequence o' the crown, and must not soil</LINE>
<LINE>The precious note of it with a base slave.</LINE>
<LINE>A hilding for a livery, a squire's cloth,</LINE>
<LINE>A pantler, not so eminent.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Profane fellow</LINE>
<LINE>Wert thou the son of Jupiter and no more</LINE>
<LINE>But what thou art besides, thou wert too base</LINE>
<LINE>To be his groom: thou wert dignified enough,</LINE>
<LINE>Even to the point of envy, if 'twere made</LINE>
<LINE>Comparative for your virtues, to be styled</LINE>
<LINE>The under-hangman of his kingdom, and hated</LINE>
<LINE>For being preferred so well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLOTEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The south-fog rot him!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He never can meet more mischance than come</LINE>
<LINE>To be but named of thee. His meanest garment,</LINE>
<LINE>That ever hath but clipp'd his body, is dearer</LINE>
<LINE>In my respect than all the hairs above thee,</LINE>
<LINE>Were they all made such men. How now, Pisanio!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter PISANIO</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLOTEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'His garment!' Now the devil--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To Dorothy my woman hie thee presently--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLOTEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'His garment!'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am sprited with a fool.</LINE>
<LINE>Frighted, and anger'd worse: go bid my woman</LINE>
<LINE>Search for a jewel that too casually</LINE>
<LINE>Hath left mine arm: it was thy master's: 'shrew me,</LINE>
<LINE>If I would lose it for a revenue</LINE>
<LINE>Of any king's in Europe. I do think</LINE>
<LINE>I saw't this morning: confident I am</LINE>
<LINE>Last night 'twas on mine arm; I kiss'd it:</LINE>
<LINE>I hope it be not gone to tell my lord</LINE>
<LINE>That I kiss aught but he.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PISANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Twill not be lost.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I hope so: go and search.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit PISANIO</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLOTEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You have abused me:</LINE>
<LINE>'His meanest garment!'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, I said so, sir:</LINE>
<LINE>If you will make't an action, call witness to't.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLOTEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will inform your father.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your mother too:</LINE>
<LINE>She's my good lady, and will conceive, I hope,</LINE>
<LINE>But the worst of me. So, I leave you, sir,</LINE>
<LINE>To the worst of discontent.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLOTEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll be revenged:</LINE>
<LINE>'His meanest garment!' Well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

</SCENE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE IV.  Rome. Philario's house.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter POSTHUMUS and PHILARIO</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fear it not, sir: I would I were so sure</LINE>
<LINE>To win the king as I am bold her honour</LINE>
<LINE>Will remain hers.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PHILARIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What means do you make to him?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not any, but abide the change of time,</LINE>
<LINE>Quake in the present winter's state and wish</LINE>
<LINE>That warmer days would come: in these sear'd hopes,</LINE>
<LINE>I barely gratify your love; they failing,</LINE>
<LINE>I must die much your debtor.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PHILARIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your very goodness and your company</LINE>
<LINE>O'erpays all I can do. By this, your king</LINE>
<LINE>Hath heard of great Augustus: Caius Lucius</LINE>
<LINE>Will do's commission throughly: and I think</LINE>
<LINE>He'll grant the tribute, send the arrearages,</LINE>
<LINE>Or look upon our Romans, whose remembrance</LINE>
<LINE>Is yet fresh in their grief.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do believe,</LINE>
<LINE>Statist though I am none, nor like to be,</LINE>
<LINE>That this will prove a war; and you shall hear</LINE>
<LINE>The legions now in Gallia sooner landed</LINE>
<LINE>In our not-fearing Britain than have tidings</LINE>
<LINE>Of any penny tribute paid. Our countrymen</LINE>
<LINE>Are men more order'd than when Julius Caesar</LINE>
<LINE>Smiled at their lack of skill, but found</LINE>
<LINE>their courage</LINE>
<LINE>Worthy his frowning at: their discipline,</LINE>
<LINE>Now mingled with their courages, will make known</LINE>
<LINE>To their approvers they are people such</LINE>
<LINE>That mend upon the world.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter IACHIMO</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PHILARIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>See! Iachimo!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The swiftest harts have posted you by land;</LINE>
<LINE>And winds of all the comers kiss'd your sails,</LINE>
<LINE>To make your vessel nimble.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PHILARIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Welcome, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I hope the briefness of your answer made</LINE>
<LINE>The speediness of your return.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IACHIMO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your lady</LINE>
<LINE>Is one of the fairest that I have look'd upon.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And therewithal the best; or let her beauty</LINE>
<LINE>Look through a casement to allure false hearts</LINE>
<LINE>And be false with them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IACHIMO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here are letters for you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Their tenor good, I trust.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IACHIMO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis very like.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PHILARIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Was Caius Lucius in the Britain court</LINE>
<LINE>When you were there?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IACHIMO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He was expected then,</LINE>
<LINE>But not approach'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>All is well yet.</LINE>
<LINE>Sparkles this stone as it was wont? or is't not</LINE>
<LINE>Too dull for your good wearing?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IACHIMO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If I had lost it,</LINE>
<LINE>I should have lost the worth of it in gold.</LINE>
<LINE>I'll make a journey twice as far, to enjoy</LINE>
<LINE>A second night of such sweet shortness which</LINE>
<LINE>Was mine in Britain, for the ring is won.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The stone's too hard to come by.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IACHIMO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not a whit,</LINE>
<LINE>Your lady being so easy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Make not, sir,</LINE>
<LINE>Your loss your sport: I hope you know that we</LINE>
<LINE>Must not continue friends.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IACHIMO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good sir, we must,</LINE>
<LINE>If you keep covenant. Had I not brought</LINE>
<LINE>The knowledge of your mistress home, I grant</LINE>
<LINE>We were to question further: but I now</LINE>
<LINE>Profess myself the winner of her honour,</LINE>
<LINE>Together with your ring; and not the wronger</LINE>
<LINE>Of her or you, having proceeded but</LINE>
<LINE>By both your wills.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If you can make't apparent</LINE>
<LINE>That you have tasted her in bed, my hand</LINE>
<LINE>And ring is yours; if not, the foul opinion</LINE>
<LINE>You had of her pure honour gains or loses</LINE>
<LINE>Your sword or mine, or masterless leaves both</LINE>
<LINE>To who shall find them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IACHIMO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, my circumstances,</LINE>
<LINE>Being so near the truth as I will make them,</LINE>
<LINE>Must first induce you to believe: whose strength</LINE>
<LINE>I will confirm with oath; which, I doubt not,</LINE>
<LINE>You'll give me leave to spare, when you shall find</LINE>
<LINE>You need it not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Proceed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IACHIMO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>First, her bedchamber,--</LINE>
<LINE>Where, I confess, I slept not, but profess</LINE>
<LINE>Had that was well worth watching--it was hang'd</LINE>
<LINE>With tapesty of silk and silver; the story</LINE>
<LINE>Proud Cleopatra, when she met her Roman,</LINE>
<LINE>And Cydnus swell'd above the banks, or for</LINE>
<LINE>The press of boats or pride: a piece of work</LINE>
<LINE>So bravely done, so rich, that it did strive</LINE>
<LINE>In workmanship and value; which I wonder'd</LINE>
<LINE>Could be so rarely and exactly wrought,</LINE>
<LINE>Since the true life on't was--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is true;</LINE>
<LINE>And this you might have heard of here, by me,</LINE>
<LINE>Or by some other.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IACHIMO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>More particulars</LINE>
<LINE>Must justify my knowledge.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So they must,</LINE>
<LINE>Or do your honour injury.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IACHIMO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The chimney</LINE>
<LINE>Is south the chamber, and the chimney-piece</LINE>
<LINE>Chaste Dian bathing: never saw I figures</LINE>
<LINE>So likely to report themselves: the cutter</LINE>
<LINE>Was as another nature, dumb; outwent her,</LINE>
<LINE>Motion and breath left out.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is a thing</LINE>
<LINE>Which you might from relation likewise reap,</LINE>
<LINE>Being, as it is, much spoke of.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IACHIMO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The roof o' the chamber</LINE>
<LINE>With golden cherubins is fretted: her andirons--</LINE>
<LINE>I had forgot them--were two winking Cupids</LINE>
<LINE>Of silver, each on one foot standing, nicely</LINE>
<LINE>Depending on their brands.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is her honour!</LINE>
<LINE>Let it be granted you have seen all this--and praise</LINE>
<LINE>Be given to your remembrance--the description</LINE>
<LINE>Of what is in her chamber nothing saves</LINE>
<LINE>The wager you have laid.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IACHIMO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then, if you can,</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Showing the bracelet</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Be pale: I beg but leave to air this jewel; see!</LINE>
<LINE>And now 'tis up again: it must be married</LINE>
<LINE>To that your diamond; I'll keep them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Jove!</LINE>
<LINE>Once more let me behold it: is it that</LINE>
<LINE>Which I left with her?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IACHIMO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir--I thank her--that:</LINE>
<LINE>She stripp'd it from her arm; I see her yet;</LINE>
<LINE>Her pretty action did outsell her gift,</LINE>
<LINE>And yet enrich'd it too: she gave it me, and said</LINE>
<LINE>She prized it once.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>May be she pluck'd it off</LINE>
<LINE>To send it me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IACHIMO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She writes so to you, doth she?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, no, no, no! 'tis true. Here, take this too;</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Gives the ring</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>It is a basilisk unto mine eye,</LINE>
<LINE>Kills me to look on't. Let there be no honour</LINE>
<LINE>Where there is beauty; truth, where semblance; love,</LINE>
<LINE>Where there's another man: the vows of women</LINE>
<LINE>Of no more bondage be, to where they are made,</LINE>
<LINE>Than they are to their virtues; which is nothing.</LINE>
<LINE>O, above measure false!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PHILARIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Have patience, sir,</LINE>
<LINE>And take your ring again; 'tis not yet won:</LINE>
<LINE>It may be probable she lost it; or</LINE>
<LINE>Who knows if one of her women, being corrupted,</LINE>
<LINE>Hath stol'n it from her?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Very true;</LINE>
<LINE>And so, I hope, he came by't. Back my ring:</LINE>
<LINE>Render to me some corporal sign about her,</LINE>
<LINE>More evident than this; for this was stolen.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IACHIMO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By Jupiter, I had it from her arm.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hark you, he swears; by Jupiter he swears.</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis true:--nay, keep the ring--'tis true: I am sure</LINE>
<LINE>She would not lose it: her attendants are</LINE>
<LINE>All sworn and honourable:--they induced to steal it!</LINE>
<LINE>And by a stranger!--No, he hath enjoyed her:</LINE>
<LINE>The cognizance of her incontinency</LINE>
<LINE>Is this: she hath bought the name of whore</LINE>
<LINE>thus dearly.</LINE>
<LINE>There, take thy hire; and all the fiends of hell</LINE>
<LINE>Divide themselves between you!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PHILARIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, be patient:</LINE>
<LINE>This is not strong enough to be believed</LINE>
<LINE>Of one persuaded well of--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Never talk on't;</LINE>
<LINE>She hath been colted by him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IACHIMO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If you seek</LINE>
<LINE>For further satisfying, under her breast--</LINE>
<LINE>Worthy the pressing--lies a mole, right proud</LINE>
<LINE>Of that most delicate lodging: by my life,</LINE>
<LINE>I kiss'd it; and it gave me present hunger</LINE>
<LINE>To feed again, though full. You do remember</LINE>
<LINE>This stain upon her?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, and it doth confirm</LINE>
<LINE>Another stain, as big as hell can hold,</LINE>
<LINE>Were there no more but it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IACHIMO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Will you hear more?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Spare your arithmetic: never count the turns;</LINE>
<LINE>Once, and a million!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IACHIMO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll be sworn--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No swearing.</LINE>
<LINE>If you will swear you have not done't, you lie;</LINE>
<LINE>And I will kill thee, if thou dost deny</LINE>
<LINE>Thou'st made me cuckold.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is there no way for men to be but women</LINE>
<LINE>Must be half-workers? We are all bastards;</LINE>
<LINE>And that most venerable man which I</LINE>
<LINE>Did call my father, was I know not where</LINE>
<LINE>When I was stamp'd; some coiner with his tools</LINE>
<LINE>Made me a counterfeit: yet my mother seem'd</LINE>
<LINE>The Dian of that time so doth my wife</LINE>
<LINE>The nonpareil of this. O, vengeance, vengeance!</LINE>
<LINE>Me of my lawful pleasure she restrain'd</LINE>
<LINE>And pray'd me oft forbearance; did it with</LINE>
<LINE>A pudency so rosy the sweet view on't</LINE>
<LINE>Might well have warm'd old Saturn; that I thought her</LINE>
<LINE>As chaste as unsunn'd snow. O, all the devils!</LINE>
<LINE>This yellow Iachimo, in an hour,--wast not?--</LINE>
<LINE>Or less,--at first?--perchance he spoke not, but,</LINE>
<LINE>Like a full-acorn'd boar, a German one,</LINE>
<LINE>Cried 'O!' and mounted; found no opposition</LINE>
<LINE>But what he look'd for should oppose and she</LINE>
<LINE>Should from encounter guard. Could I find out</LINE>
<LINE>The woman's part in me! For there's no motion</LINE>
<LINE>That tends to vice in man, but I affirm</LINE>
<LINE>It is the woman's part: be it lying, note it,</LINE>
<LINE>The woman's; flattering, hers; deceiving, hers;</LINE>
<LINE>Lust and rank thoughts, hers, hers; revenges, hers;</LINE>
<LINE>Ambitions, covetings, change of prides, disdain,</LINE>
<LINE>Nice longing, slanders, mutability,</LINE>
<LINE>All faults that may be named, nay, that hell knows,</LINE>
<LINE>Why, hers, in part or all; but rather, all;</LINE>
<LINE>For even to vice</LINE>
<LINE>They are not constant but are changing still</LINE>
<LINE>One vice, but of a minute old, for one</LINE>
<LINE>Not half so old as that. I'll write against them,</LINE>
<LINE>Detest them, curse them: yet 'tis greater skill</LINE>

and Lords at one door, and at another,
CAIUS LUCIUS and Attendants</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now say, what would Augustus Caesar with us?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAIUS LUCIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>When Julius Caesar, whose remembrance yet</LINE>
<LINE>Lives in men's eyes and will to ears and tongues</LINE>
<LINE>Be theme and hearing ever, was in this Britain</LINE>
<LINE>And conquer'd it, Cassibelan, thine uncle,--</LINE>
<LINE>Famous in Caesar's praises, no whit less</LINE>
<LINE>Than in his feats deserving it--for him</LINE>
<LINE>And his succession granted Rome a tribute,</LINE>
<LINE>Yearly three thousand pounds, which by thee lately</LINE>
<LINE>Is left untender'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And, to kill the marvel,</LINE>
<LINE>Shall be so ever.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLOTEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There be many Caesars,</LINE>
<LINE>Ere such another Julius. Britain is</LINE>
<LINE>A world by itself; and we will nothing pay</LINE>
<LINE>For wearing our own noses.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That opportunity</LINE>
<LINE>Which then they had to take from 's, to resume</LINE>
<LINE>We have again. Remember, sir, my liege,</LINE>
<LINE>The kings your ancestors, together with</LINE>
<LINE>The natural bravery of your isle, which stands</LINE>
<LINE>As Neptune's park, ribbed and paled in</LINE>
<LINE>With rocks unscalable and roaring waters,</LINE>
<LINE>With sands that will not bear your enemies' boats,</LINE>
<LINE>But suck them up to the topmast. A kind of conquest</LINE>
<LINE>Caesar made here; but made not here his brag</LINE>
<LINE>Of 'Came' and 'saw' and 'overcame: ' with shame--</LINE>
<LINE>That first that ever touch'd him--he was carried</LINE>
<LINE>From off our coast, twice beaten; and his shipping--</LINE>
<LINE>Poor ignorant baubles!-- upon our terrible seas,</LINE>
<LINE>Like egg-shells moved upon their surges, crack'd</LINE>
<LINE>As easily 'gainst our rocks: for joy whereof</LINE>
<LINE>The famed Cassibelan, who was once at point--</LINE>
<LINE>O giglot fortune!--to master Caesar's sword,</LINE>
<LINE>Made Lud's town with rejoicing fires bright</LINE>
<LINE>And Britons strut with courage.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLOTEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, there's no more tribute to be paid: our</LINE>
<LINE>kingdom is stronger than it was at that time; and,</LINE>
<LINE>as I said, there is no moe such Caesars: other of</LINE>
<LINE>them may have crook'd noses, but to owe such</LINE>
<LINE>straight arms, none.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Son, let your mother end.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLOTEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We have yet many among us can gripe as hard as</LINE>
<LINE>Cassibelan: I do not say I am one; but I have a</LINE>
<LINE>hand. Why tribute? why should we pay tribute? If</LINE>
<LINE>Caesar can hide the sun from us with a blanket, or</LINE>
<LINE>put the moon in his pocket, we will pay him tribute</LINE>
<LINE>for light; else, sir, no more tribute, pray you now.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You must know,</LINE>
<LINE>Till the injurious Romans did extort</LINE>
<LINE>This tribute from us, we were free:</LINE>
<LINE>Caesar's ambition,</LINE>
<LINE>Which swell'd so much that it did almost stretch</LINE>
<LINE>The sides o' the world, against all colour here</LINE>
<LINE>Did put the yoke upon 's; which to shake off</LINE>
<LINE>Becomes a warlike people, whom we reckon</LINE>
<LINE>Ourselves to be.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLOTEN</SPEAKER>
<SPEAKER>Lords</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We do.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Say, then, to Caesar,</LINE>
<LINE>Our ancestor was that Mulmutius which</LINE>
<LINE>Ordain'd our laws, whose use the sword of Caesar</LINE>
<LINE>Hath too much mangled; whose repair and franchise</LINE>
<LINE>Shall, by the power we hold, be our good deed,</LINE>
<LINE>Though Rome be therefore angry: Mulmutius made our laws,</LINE>
<LINE>Who was the first of Britain which did put</LINE>
<LINE>His brows within a golden crown and call'd</LINE>
<LINE>Himself a king.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAIUS LUCIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am sorry, Cymbeline,</LINE>
<LINE>That I am to pronounce Augustus Caesar--</LINE>
<LINE>Caesar, that hath more kings his servants than</LINE>
<LINE>Thyself domestic officers--thine enemy:</LINE>
<LINE>Receive it from me, then: war and confusion</LINE>
<LINE>In Caesar's name pronounce I 'gainst thee: look</LINE>
<LINE>For fury not to be resisted. Thus defied,</LINE>
<LINE>I thank thee for myself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou art welcome, Caius.</LINE>
<LINE>Thy Caesar knighted me; my youth I spent</LINE>
<LINE>Much under him; of him I gather'd honour;</LINE>
<LINE>Which he to seek of me again, perforce,</LINE>
<LINE>Behoves me keep at utterance. I am perfect</LINE>
<LINE>That the Pannonians and Dalmatians for</LINE>
<LINE>Their liberties are now in arms; a precedent</LINE>
<LINE>Which not to read would show the Britons cold:</LINE>
<LINE>So Caesar shall not find them.</LINE>

<LINE>Let proof speak.</LINE>

<LINE>beat us out of it, it is yours; if you fall in</LINE>

<LINE>How? of adultery? Wherefore write you not</LINE>

<LINE>O master! what a strange infection</LINE>
<LINE>Is fall'n into thy ear! What false Italian,</LINE>
<LINE>As poisonous-tongued as handed, hath prevail'd</LINE>
<LINE>On thy too ready hearing? Disloyal! No:</LINE>
<LINE>She's punish'd for her truth, and undergoes,</LINE>
<LINE>More goddess-like than wife-like, such assaults</LINE>
<LINE>As would take in some virtue. O my master!</LINE>
<LINE>Thy mind to her is now as low as were</LINE>
<LINE>Thy fortunes. How! that I should murder her?</LINE>
<LINE>Upon the love and truth and vows which I</LINE>
<LINE>Have made to thy command? I, her? her blood?</LINE>
<LINE>If it be so to do good service, never</LINE>
<LINE>Let me be counted serviceable. How look I,</LINE>
<LINE>That I should seem to lack humanity</LINE>
<LINE>so much as this fact comes to?</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Reading</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>'Do't: the letter</LINE>
<LINE>that I have sent her, by her own command</LINE>
<LINE>Shall give thee opportunity.' O damn'd paper!</LINE>
<LINE>Black as the ink that's on thee! Senseless bauble,</LINE>
<LINE>Art thou a feodary for this act, and look'st</LINE>
<LINE>So virgin-like without? Lo, here she comes.</LINE>

<LINE>Who? thy lord? that is my lord, Leonatus!</LINE>
<LINE>O, learn'd indeed were that astronomer</LINE>
<LINE>That knew the stars as I his characters;</LINE>
<LINE>He'ld lay the future open. You good gods,</LINE>
<LINE>Let what is here contain'd relish of love,</LINE>
<LINE>Of my lord's health, of his content, yet not</LINE>
<LINE>That we two are asunder; let that grieve him:</LINE>
<LINE>Some griefs are med'cinable; that is one of them,</LINE>
<LINE>For it doth physic love: of his content,</LINE>
<LINE>All but in that! Good wax, thy leave. Blest be</LINE>
<LINE>You bees that make these locks of counsel! Lovers</LINE>
<LINE>And men in dangerous bonds pray not alike:</LINE>
<LINE>Though forfeiters you cast in prison, yet</LINE>
<LINE>You clasp young Cupid's tables. Good news, gods!</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Reads</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>'Justice, and your father's wrath, should he take me</LINE>
<LINE>in his dominion, could not be so cruel to me, as</LINE>
<LINE>you, O the dearest of creatures, would even renew me</LINE>
<LINE>with your eyes. Take notice that I am in Cambria,</LINE>
<LINE>at Milford-Haven: what your own love will out of</LINE>

<LINE>LEONATUS POSTHUMUS.'</LINE>
<LINE>O, for a horse with wings! Hear'st thou, Pisanio?</LINE>
<LINE>He is at Milford-Haven: read, and tell me</LINE>
<LINE>How far 'tis thither. If one of mean affairs</LINE>
<LINE>May plod it in a week, why may not I</LINE>
<LINE>Glide thither in a day? Then, true Pisanio,--</LINE>
<LINE>Who long'st, like me, to see thy lord; who long'st,--</LINE>
<LINE>let me bate,-but not like me--yet long'st,</LINE>
<LINE>But in a fainter kind:--O, not like me;</LINE>
<LINE>For mine's beyond beyond--say, and speak thick;</LINE>
<LINE>Love's counsellor should fill the bores of hearing,</LINE>
<LINE>To the smothering of the sense--how far it is</LINE>

<LINE>To inherit such a haven: but first of all,</LINE>
<LINE>How we may steal from hence, and for the gap</LINE>
<LINE>That we shall make in time, from our hence-going</LINE>
<LINE>And our return, to excuse: but first, how get hence:</LINE>
<LINE>Why should excuse be born or e'er begot?</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, one that rode to's execution, man,</LINE>
<LINE>Could never go so slow: I have heard of</LINE>
<LINE>riding wagers,</LINE>
<LINE>Where horses have been nimbler than the sands</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BELARIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A goodly day not to keep house, with such</LINE>
<LINE>Whose roof's as low as ours! Stoop, boys; this gate</LINE>
<LINE>Instructs you how to adore the heavens and bows you</LINE>
<LINE>To a morning's holy office: the gates of monarchs</LINE>
<LINE>Are arch'd so high that giants may jet through</LINE>
<LINE>And keep their impious turbans on, without</LINE>
<LINE>Good morrow to the sun. Hail, thou fair heaven!</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BELARIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now for our mountain sport: up to yond hill;</LINE>
<LINE>Your legs are young; I'll tread these flats. Consider,</LINE>
<LINE>When you above perceive me like a crow,</LINE>
<LINE>That it is place which lessens and sets off;</LINE>
<LINE>And you may then revolve what tales I have told you</LINE>
<LINE>Of courts, of princes, of the tricks in war:</LINE>
<LINE>This service is not service, so being done,</LINE>
<LINE>But being so allow'd: to apprehend thus,</LINE>
<LINE>Draws us a profit from all things we see;</LINE>
<LINE>And often, to our comfort, shall we find</LINE>
<LINE>The sharded beetle in a safer hold</LINE>
<LINE>Than is the full-wing'd eagle. O, this life</LINE>
<LINE>Is nobler than attending for a cheque,</LINE>
<LINE>Richer than doing nothing for a bauble,</LINE>
<LINE>Prouder than rustling in unpaid-for silk:</LINE>
<LINE>Such gain the cap of him that makes 'em fine,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet keeps his book uncross'd: no life to ours.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUIDERIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Out of your proof you speak: we, poor unfledged,</LINE>
<LINE>Have never wing'd from view o' the nest, nor know not</LINE>
<LINE>What air's from home. Haply this life is best,</LINE>
<LINE>If quiet life be best; sweeter to you</LINE>
<LINE>That have a sharper known; well corresponding</LINE>
<LINE>With your stiff age: but unto us it is</LINE>
<LINE>A cell of ignorance; travelling a-bed;</LINE>
<LINE>A prison for a debtor, that not dares</LINE>
<LINE>To stride a limit.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARVIRAGUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What should we speak of</LINE>
<LINE>When we are old as you? when we shall hear</LINE>
<LINE>The rain and wind beat dark December, how,</LINE>
<LINE>In this our pinching cave, shall we discourse</LINE>
<LINE>The freezing hours away? We have seen nothing;</LINE>
<LINE>We are beastly, subtle as the fox for prey,</LINE>
<LINE>Like warlike as the wolf for what we eat;</LINE>
<LINE>Our valour is to chase what flies; our cage</LINE>
<LINE>We make a quire, as doth the prison'd bird,</LINE>
<LINE>And sing our bondage freely.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BELARIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How you speak!</LINE>
<LINE>Did you but know the city's usuries</LINE>
<LINE>And felt them knowingly; the art o' the court</LINE>
<LINE>As hard to leave as keep; whose top to climb</LINE>
<LINE>Is certain falling, or so slippery that</LINE>
<LINE>The fear's as bad as falling; the toil o' the war,</LINE>
<LINE>A pain that only seems to seek out danger</LINE>
<LINE>I' the name of fame and honour; which dies i'</LINE>
<LINE>the search,</LINE>
<LINE>And hath as oft a slanderous epitaph</LINE>
<LINE>As record of fair act; nay, many times,</LINE>
<LINE>Doth ill deserve by doing well; what's worse,</LINE>
<LINE>Must court'sy at the censure:--O boys, this story</LINE>
<LINE>The world may read in me: my body's mark'd</LINE>
<LINE>With Roman swords, and my report was once</LINE>
<LINE>First with the best of note: Cymbeline loved me,</LINE>
<LINE>And when a soldier was the theme, my name</LINE>
<LINE>Was not far off: then was I as a tree</LINE>
<LINE>Whose boughs did bend with fruit: but in one night,</LINE>
<LINE>A storm or robbery, call it what you will,</LINE>
<LINE>Shook down my mellow hangings, nay, my leaves,</LINE>
<LINE>And left me bare to weather.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUIDERIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Uncertain favour!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BELARIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My fault being nothing--as I have told you oft--</LINE>
<LINE>But that two villains, whose false oaths prevail'd</LINE>
<LINE>Before my perfect honour, swore to Cymbeline</LINE>
<LINE>I was confederate with the Romans: so</LINE>
<LINE>Follow'd my banishment, and this twenty years</LINE>
<LINE>This rock and these demesnes have been my world;</LINE>
<LINE>Where I have lived at honest freedom, paid</LINE>
<LINE>More pious debts to heaven than in all</LINE>
<LINE>The fore-end of my time. But up to the mountains!</LINE>
<LINE>This is not hunters' language: he that strikes</LINE>
<LINE>The venison first shall be the lord o' the feast;</LINE>
<LINE>To him the other two shall minister;</LINE>
<LINE>And we will fear no poison, which attends</LINE>
<LINE>In place of greater state. I'll meet you in the valleys.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exeunt GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>How hard it is to hide the sparks of nature!</LINE>
<LINE>These boys know little they are sons to the king;</LINE>
<LINE>Nor Cymbeline dreams that they are alive.</LINE>
<LINE>They think they are mine; and though train'd</LINE>
<LINE>up thus meanly</LINE>
<LINE>I' the cave wherein they bow, their thoughts do hit</LINE>
<LINE>The roofs of palaces, and nature prompts them</LINE>
<LINE>In simple and low things to prince it much</LINE>
<LINE>Beyond the trick of others. This Polydore,</LINE>
<LINE>The heir of Cymbeline and Britain, who</LINE>
<LINE>The king his father call'd Guiderius,--Jove!</LINE>
<LINE>When on my three-foot stool I sit and tell</LINE>
<LINE>The warlike feats I have done, his spirits fly out</LINE>
<LINE>Into my story: say 'Thus, mine enemy fell,</LINE>
<LINE>And thus I set my foot on 's neck;' even then</LINE>
<LINE>The princely blood flows in his cheek, he sweats,</LINE>
<LINE>Strains his young nerves and puts himself in posture</LINE>
<LINE>That acts my words. The younger brother, Cadwal,</LINE>
<LINE>Once Arviragus, in as like a figure,</LINE>
<LINE>Strikes life into my speech and shows much more</LINE>
<LINE>His own conceiving.--Hark, the game is roused!</LINE>
<LINE>O Cymbeline! heaven and my conscience knows</LINE>
<LINE>Thou didst unjustly banish me: whereon,</LINE>
<LINE>At three and two years old, I stole these babes;</LINE>
<LINE>Thinking to bar thee of succession, as</LINE>
<LINE>Thou reft'st me of my lands. Euriphile,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou wast their nurse; they took thee for</LINE>
<LINE>their mother,</LINE>
<LINE>And every day do honour to her grave:</LINE>

<LINE>it is done, thou art the pandar to her dishonour and</LINE>
<LINE>equally to me disloyal.'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PISANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What shall I need to draw my sword? the paper</LINE>
<LINE>Hath cut her throat already. No, 'tis slander,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose edge is sharper than the sword, whose tongue</LINE>
<LINE>Outvenoms all the worms of Nile, whose breath</LINE>
<LINE>Rides on the posting winds and doth belie</LINE>
<LINE>All corners of the world: kings, queens and states,</LINE>
<LINE>Maids, matrons, nay, the secrets of the grave</LINE>
<LINE>This viperous slander enters. What cheer, madam?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>False to his bed! What is it to be false?</LINE>
<LINE>To lie in watch there and to think on him?</LINE>
<LINE>To weep 'twixt clock and clock? if sleep</LINE>
<LINE>charge nature,</LINE>
<LINE>To break it with a fearful dream of him</LINE>
<LINE>And cry myself awake? that's false to's bed, is it?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PISANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alas, good lady!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I false! Thy conscience witness: Iachimo,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou didst accuse him of incontinency;</LINE>
<LINE>Thou then look'dst like a villain; now methinks</LINE>
<LINE>Thy favour's good enough. Some jay of Italy</LINE>
<LINE>Whose mother was her painting, hath betray'd him:</LINE>
<LINE>Poor I am stale, a garment out of fashion;</LINE>
<LINE>And, for I am richer than to hang by the walls,</LINE>
<LINE>I must be ripp'd:--to pieces with me!--O,</LINE>
<LINE>Men's vows are women's traitors! All good seeming,</LINE>
<LINE>By thy revolt, O husband, shall be thought</LINE>
<LINE>Put on for villany; not born where't grows,</LINE>
<LINE>But worn a bait for ladies.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PISANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good madam, hear me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>True honest men being heard, like false Aeneas,</LINE>
<LINE>Were in his time thought false, and Sinon's weeping</LINE>
<LINE>Did scandal many a holy tear, took pity</LINE>
<LINE>From most true wretchedness: so thou, Posthumus,</LINE>
<LINE>Wilt lay the leaven on all proper men;</LINE>
<LINE>Goodly and gallant shall be false and perjured</LINE>
<LINE>From thy great fall. Come, fellow, be thou honest:</LINE>
<LINE>Do thou thy master's bidding: when thou see'st him,</LINE>
<LINE>A little witness my obedience: look!</LINE>
<LINE>I draw the sword myself: take it, and hit</LINE>
<LINE>The innocent mansion of my love, my heart;</LINE>
<LINE>Fear not; 'tis empty of all things but grief;</LINE>
<LINE>Thy master is not there, who was indeed</LINE>
<LINE>The riches of it: do his bidding; strike</LINE>
<LINE>Thou mayst be valiant in a better cause;</LINE>
<LINE>But now thou seem'st a coward.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PISANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hence, vile instrument!</LINE>
<LINE>Thou shalt not damn my hand.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, I must die;</LINE>
<LINE>And if I do not by thy hand, thou art</LINE>
<LINE>No servant of thy master's. Against self-slaughter</LINE>
<LINE>There is a prohibition so divine</LINE>
<LINE>That cravens my weak hand. Come, here's my heart.</LINE>
<LINE>Something's afore't. Soft, soft! we'll no defence;</LINE>
<LINE>Obedient as the scabbard. What is here?</LINE>
<LINE>The scriptures of the loyal Leonatus,</LINE>
<LINE>All turn'd to heresy? Away, away,</LINE>
<LINE>Corrupters of my faith! you shall no more</LINE>
<LINE>Be stomachers to my heart. Thus may poor fools</LINE>
<LINE>Believe false teachers: though those that</LINE>
<LINE>are betray'd</LINE>
<LINE>Do feel the treason sharply, yet the traitor</LINE>
<LINE>Stands in worse case of woe.</LINE>
<LINE>And thou, Posthumus, thou that didst set up</LINE>
<LINE>My disobedience 'gainst the king my father</LINE>
<LINE>And make me put into contempt the suits</LINE>
<LINE>Of princely fellows, shalt hereafter find</LINE>
<LINE>It is no act of common passage, but</LINE>
<LINE>A strain of rareness: and I grieve myself</LINE>
<LINE>To think, when thou shalt be disedged by her</LINE>
<LINE>That now thou tirest on, how thy memory</LINE>
<LINE>Will then be pang'd by me. Prithee, dispatch:</LINE>
<LINE>The lamb entreats the butcher: where's thy knife?</LINE>
<LINE>Thou art too slow to do thy master's bidding,</LINE>
<LINE>When I desire it too.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PISANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O gracious lady,</LINE>
<LINE>Since I received command to do this business</LINE>
<LINE>I have not slept one wink.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do't, and to bed then.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PISANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll wake mine eye-balls blind first.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Wherefore then</LINE>
<LINE>Didst undertake it? Why hast thou abused</LINE>
<LINE>So many miles with a pretence? this place?</LINE>
<LINE>Mine action and thine own? our horses' labour?</LINE>
<LINE>The time inviting thee? the perturb'd court,</LINE>
<LINE>For my being absent? whereunto I never</LINE>
<LINE>Purpose return. Why hast thou gone so far,</LINE>
<LINE>To be unbent when thou hast ta'en thy stand,</LINE>
<LINE>The elected deer before thee?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PISANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But to win time</LINE>
<LINE>To lose so bad employment; in the which</LINE>
<LINE>I have consider'd of a course. Good lady,</LINE>
<LINE>Hear me with patience.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Talk thy tongue weary; speak</LINE>
<LINE>I have heard I am a strumpet; and mine ear</LINE>
<LINE>Therein false struck, can take no greater wound,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor tent to bottom that. But speak.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PISANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then, madam,</LINE>
<LINE>I thought you would not back again.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Most like;</LINE>
<LINE>Bringing me here to kill me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PISANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not so, neither:</LINE>
<LINE>But if I were as wise as honest, then</LINE>
<LINE>My purpose would prove well. It cannot be</LINE>
<LINE>But that my master is abused:</LINE>
<LINE>Some villain, ay, and singular in his art.</LINE>
<LINE>Hath done you both this cursed injury.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Some Roman courtezan.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PISANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, on my life.</LINE>
<LINE>I'll give but notice you are dead and send him</LINE>
<LINE>Some bloody sign of it; for 'tis commanded</LINE>
<LINE>I should do so: you shall be miss'd at court,</LINE>
<LINE>And that will well confirm it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why good fellow,</LINE>
<LINE>What shall I do the where? where bide? how live?</LINE>
<LINE>Or in my life what comfort, when I am</LINE>
<LINE>Dead to my husband?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PISANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If you'll back to the court--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No court, no father; nor no more ado</LINE>
<LINE>With that harsh, noble, simple nothing,</LINE>
<LINE>That Cloten, whose love-suit hath been to me</LINE>
<LINE>As fearful as a siege.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PISANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If not at court,</LINE>
<LINE>Then not in Britain must you bide.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where then</LINE>
<LINE>Hath Britain all the sun that shines? Day, night,</LINE>
<LINE>Are they not but in Britain? I' the world's volume</LINE>
<LINE>Our Britain seems as of it, but not in 't;</LINE>
<LINE>In a great pool a swan's nest: prithee, think</LINE>
<LINE>There's livers out of Britain.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PISANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am most glad</LINE>
<LINE>You think of other place. The ambassador,</LINE>
<LINE>Lucius the Roman, comes to Milford-Haven</LINE>
<LINE>To-morrow: now, if you could wear a mind</LINE>
<LINE>Dark as your fortune is, and but disguise</LINE>
<LINE>That which, to appear itself, must not yet be</LINE>
<LINE>But by self-danger, you should tread a course</LINE>
<LINE>Pretty and full of view; yea, haply, near</LINE>
<LINE>The residence of Posthumus; so nigh at least</LINE>
<LINE>That though his actions were not visible, yet</LINE>
<LINE>Report should render him hourly to your ear</LINE>
<LINE>As truly as he moves.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, for such means!</LINE>
<LINE>Though peril to my modesty, not death on't,</LINE>
<LINE>I would adventure.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PISANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, then, here's the point:</LINE>
<LINE>You must forget to be a woman; change</LINE>
<LINE>Command into obedience: fear and niceness--</LINE>
<LINE>The handmaids of all women, or, more truly,</LINE>
<LINE>Woman its pretty self--into a waggish courage:</LINE>
<LINE>Ready in gibes, quick-answer'd, saucy and</LINE>
<LINE>As quarrelous as the weasel; nay, you must</LINE>
<LINE>Forget that rarest treasure of your cheek,</LINE>
<LINE>Exposing it--but, O, the harder heart!</LINE>
<LINE>Alack, no remedy!--to the greedy touch</LINE>
<LINE>Of common-kissing Titan, and forget</LINE>
<LINE>Your laboursome and dainty trims, wherein</LINE>
<LINE>You made great Juno angry.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, be brief</LINE>
<LINE>I see into thy end, and am almost</LINE>
<LINE>A man already.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PISANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>First, make yourself but like one.</LINE>
<LINE>Fore-thinking this, I have already fit--</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis in my cloak-bag--doublet, hat, hose, all</LINE>
<LINE>That answer to them: would you in their serving,</LINE>
<LINE>And with what imitation you can borrow</LINE>
<LINE>From youth of such a season, 'fore noble Lucius</LINE>
<LINE>Present yourself, desire his service, tell him</LINE>
<LINE>wherein you're happy,--which you'll make him know,</LINE>
<LINE>If that his head have ear in music,--doubtless</LINE>
<LINE>With joy he will embrace you, for he's honourable</LINE>
<LINE>And doubling that, most holy. Your means abroad,</LINE>
<LINE>You have me, rich; and I will never fail</LINE>
<LINE>Beginning nor supplyment.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou art all the comfort</LINE>
<LINE>The gods will diet me with. Prithee, away:</LINE>
<LINE>There's more to be consider'd; but we'll even</LINE>
<LINE>All that good time will give us: this attempt</LINE>
<LINE>I am soldier to, and will abide it with</LINE>
<LINE>A prince's courage. Away, I prithee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PISANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, madam, we must take a short farewell,</LINE>
<LINE>Lest, being miss'd, I be suspected of</LINE>
<LINE>Your carriage from the court. My noble mistress,</LINE>
<LINE>Here is a box; I had it from the queen:</LINE>
<LINE>What's in't is precious; if you are sick at sea,</LINE>
<LINE>Or stomach-qualm'd at land, a dram of this</LINE>
<LINE>Will drive away distemper. To some shade,</LINE>
<LINE>And fit you to your manhood. May the gods</LINE>
<LINE>Direct you to the best!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Amen: I thank thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt, severally</STAGEDIR>
</SCENE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE V.  A room in Cymbeline's palace.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter CYMBELINE, QUEEN, CLOTEN, LUCIUS,
Lords, and Attendants</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thus far; and so farewell.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAIUS LUCIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thanks, royal sir.</LINE>
<LINE>My emperor hath wrote, I must from hence;</LINE>
<LINE>And am right sorry that I must report ye</LINE>
<LINE>My master's enemy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Our subjects, sir,</LINE>
<LINE>Will not endure his yoke; and for ourself</LINE>
<LINE>To show less sovereignty than they, must needs</LINE>
<LINE>Appear unkinglike.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAIUS LUCIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So, sir: I desire of you</LINE>
<LINE>A conduct over-land to Milford-Haven.</LINE>
<LINE>Madam, all joy befal your grace!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And you!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lords, you are appointed for that office;</LINE>
<LINE>The due of honour in no point omit.</LINE>
<LINE>So farewell, noble Lucius.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAIUS LUCIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your hand, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLOTEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Receive it friendly; but from this time forth</LINE>
<LINE>I wear it as your enemy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAIUS LUCIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, the event</LINE>
<LINE>Is yet to name the winner: fare you well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Leave not the worthy Lucius, good my lords,</LINE>
<LINE>Till he have cross'd the Severn. Happiness!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt LUCIUS and Lords</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He goes hence frowning: but it honours us</LINE>
<LINE>That we have given him cause.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLOTEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis all the better;</LINE>
<LINE>Your valiant Britons have their wishes in it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lucius hath wrote already to the emperor</LINE>
<LINE>How it goes here. It fits us therefore ripely</LINE>
<LINE>Our chariots and our horsemen be in readiness:</LINE>
<LINE>The powers that he already hath in Gallia</LINE>
<LINE>Will soon be drawn to head, from whence he moves</LINE>
<LINE>His war for Britain.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis not sleepy business;</LINE>
<LINE>But must be look'd to speedily and strongly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Our expectation that it would be thus</LINE>
<LINE>Hath made us forward. But, my gentle queen,</LINE>
<LINE>Where is our daughter? She hath not appear'd</LINE>
<LINE>Before the Roman, nor to us hath tender'd</LINE>
<LINE>The duty of the day: she looks us like</LINE>
<LINE>A thing more made of malice than of duty:</LINE>
<LINE>We have noted it. Call her before us; for</LINE>
<LINE>We have been too slight in sufferance.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit an Attendant</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Royal sir,</LINE>
<LINE>Since the exile of Posthumus, most retired</LINE>
<LINE>Hath her life been; the cure whereof, my lord,</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis time must do. Beseech your majesty,</LINE>
<LINE>Forbear sharp speeches to her: she's a lady</LINE>
<LINE>So tender of rebukes that words are strokes</LINE>
<LINE>And strokes death to her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Re-enter Attendant</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where is she, sir? How</LINE>
<LINE>Can her contempt be answer'd?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Attendant</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Please you, sir,</LINE>
<LINE>Her chambers are all lock'd; and there's no answer</LINE>
<LINE>That will be given to the loudest noise we make.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, when last I went to visit her,</LINE>
<LINE>She pray'd me to excuse her keeping close,</LINE>
<LINE>Whereto constrain'd by her infirmity,</LINE>
<LINE>She should that duty leave unpaid to you,</LINE>
<LINE>Which daily she was bound to proffer: this</LINE>
<LINE>She wish'd me to make known; but our great court</LINE>
<LINE>Made me to blame in memory.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Her doors lock'd?</LINE>
<LINE>Not seen of late? Grant, heavens, that which I fear</LINE>
<LINE>Prove false!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Son, I say, follow the king.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLOTEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That man of hers, Pisanio, her old servant,</LINE>
<LINE>have not seen these two days.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go, look after.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit CLOTEN</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Pisanio, thou that stand'st so for Posthumus!</LINE>
<LINE>He hath a drug of mine; I pray his absence</LINE>
<LINE>Proceed by swallowing that, for he believes</LINE>
<LINE>It is a thing most precious. But for her,</LINE>
<LINE>Where is she gone? Haply, despair hath seized her,</LINE>
<LINE>Or, wing'd with fervor of her love, she's flown</LINE>
<LINE>To her desired Posthumus: gone she is</LINE>
<LINE>To death or to dishonour; and my end</LINE>
<LINE>Can make good use of either: she being down,</LINE>
<LINE>I have the placing of the British crown.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Re-enter CLOTEN</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>How now, my son!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLOTEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis certain she is fled.</LINE>
<LINE>Go in and cheer the king: he rages; none</LINE>
<LINE>Dare come about him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>            All the better: may</LINE>
<LINE>This night forestall him of the coming day!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLOTEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I love and hate her: for she's fair and royal,</LINE>
<LINE>And that she hath all courtly parts more exquisite</LINE>
<LINE>Than lady, ladies, woman; from every one</LINE>
<LINE>The best she hath, and she, of all compounded,</LINE>
<LINE>Outsells them all; I love her therefore: but</LINE>
<LINE>Disdaining me and throwing favours on</LINE>
<LINE>The low Posthumus slanders so her judgment</LINE>
<LINE>That what's else rare is choked; and in that point</LINE>
<LINE>I will conclude to hate her, nay, indeed,</LINE>
<LINE>To be revenged upon her. For when fools Shall--</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter PISANIO</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Who is here? What, are you packing, sirrah?</LINE>
<LINE>Come hither: ah, you precious pander! Villain,</LINE>
<LINE>Where is thy lady? In a word; or else</LINE>
<LINE>Thou art straightway with the fiends.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PISANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, good my lord!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLOTEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where is thy lady? Or, by Jupiter,--</LINE>
<LINE>I will not ask again. Close villain,</LINE>
<LINE>I'll have this secret from thy heart, or rip</LINE>
<LINE>Thy heart to find it. Is she with Posthumus?</LINE>
<LINE>From whose so many weights of baseness cannot</LINE>
<LINE>A dram of worth be drawn.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PISANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alas, my lord,</LINE>
<LINE>How can she be with him? When was she missed?</LINE>
<LINE>He is in Rome.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLOTEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where is she, sir? Come nearer;</LINE>
<LINE>No further halting: satisfy me home</LINE>
<LINE>What is become of her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PISANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, my all-worthy lord!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLOTEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>All-worthy villain!</LINE>
<LINE>Discover where thy mistress is at once,</LINE>
<LINE>At the next word: no more of 'worthy lord!'</LINE>
<LINE>Speak, or thy silence on the instant is</LINE>
<LINE>Thy condemnation and thy death.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PISANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then, sir,</LINE>
<LINE>This paper is the history of my knowledge</LINE>
<LINE>Touching her flight.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Presenting a letter</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLOTEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let's see't. I will pursue her</LINE>
<LINE>Even to Augustus' throne.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PISANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>                 Or this, or perish.</LINE>
<LINE>She's far enough; and what he learns by this</LINE>
<LINE>May prove his travel, not her danger.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLOTEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hum!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PISANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  I'll write to my lord she's dead. O Imogen,</LINE>
<LINE>Safe mayst thou wander, safe return again!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLOTEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sirrah, is this letter true?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PISANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, as I think.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLOTEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is Posthumus' hand; I know't. Sirrah, if thou</LINE>
<LINE>wouldst not be a villain, but do me true service,</LINE>
<LINE>undergo those employments wherein I should have</LINE>
<LINE>cause to use thee with a serious industry, that is,</LINE>
<LINE>what villany soe'er I bid thee do, to perform it</LINE>
<LINE>directly and truly, I would think thee an honest</LINE>
<LINE>man: thou shouldst neither want my means for thy</LINE>
<LINE>relief nor my voice for thy preferment.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PISANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, my good lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLOTEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Wilt thou serve me? for since patiently and</LINE>
<LINE>constantly thou hast stuck to the bare fortune of</LINE>
<LINE>that beggar Posthumus, thou canst not, in the</LINE>
<LINE>course of gratitude, but be a diligent follower of</LINE>
<LINE>mine: wilt thou serve me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PISANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, I will.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLOTEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Give me thy hand; here's my purse. Hast any of thy</LINE>
<LINE>late master's garments in thy possession?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PISANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have, my lord, at my lodging, the same suit he</LINE>
<LINE>wore when he took leave of my lady and mistress.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLOTEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The first service thou dost me, fetch that suit</LINE>
<LINE>hither: let it be thy lint service; go.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PISANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I shall, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLOTEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Meet thee at Milford-Haven!--I forgot to ask him one</LINE>
<LINE>thing; I'll remember't anon:--even there, thou</LINE>
<LINE>villain Posthumus, will I kill thee. I would these</LINE>
<LINE>garments were come. She said upon a time--the</LINE>
<LINE>bitterness of it I now belch from my heart--that she</LINE>
<LINE>held the very garment of Posthumus in more respect</LINE>
<LINE>than my noble and natural person together with the</LINE>
<LINE>adornment of my qualities. With that suit upon my</LINE>
<LINE>back, will I ravish her: first kill him, and in her</LINE>
<LINE>eyes; there shall she see my valour, which will then</LINE>
<LINE>be a torment to her contempt. He on the ground, my</LINE>
<LINE>speech of insultment ended on his dead body, and</LINE>
<LINE>when my lust hath dined,--which, as I say, to vex</LINE>
<LINE>her I will execute in the clothes that she so</LINE>
<LINE>praised,--to the court I'll knock her back, foot</LINE>
<LINE>her home again. She hath despised me rejoicingly,</LINE>
<LINE>and I'll be merry in my revenge.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Re-enter PISANIO, with the clothes</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Be those the garments?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PISANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, my noble lord.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>CLOTEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How long is't since she went to Milford-Haven?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PISANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She can scarce be there yet.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLOTEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Bring this apparel to my chamber; that is the second</LINE>
<LINE>thing that I have commanded thee: the third is,</LINE>
<LINE>that thou wilt be a voluntary mute to my design. Be</LINE>
<LINE>but duteous, and true preferment shall tender itself</LINE>
<LINE>to thee. My revenge is now at Milford: would I had</LINE>
<LINE>wings to follow it! Come, and be true.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PISANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou bid'st me to my loss: for true to thee</LINE>
<LINE>Were to prove false, which I will never be,</LINE>
<LINE>To him that is most true. To Milford go,</LINE>
<LINE>And find not her whom thou pursuest. Flow, flow,</LINE>
<LINE>You heavenly blessings, on her! This fool's speed</LINE>
<LINE>Be cross'd with slowness; labour be his meed!</LINE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE VI.  Wales. Before the cave of Belarius.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter IMOGEN, in boy's clothes</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I see a man's life is a tedious one:</LINE>
<LINE>I have tired myself, and for two nights together</LINE>
<LINE>Have made the ground my bed. I should be sick,</LINE>
<LINE>But that my resolution helps me. Milford,</LINE>
<LINE>When from the mountain-top Pisanio show'd thee,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou wast within a ken: O Jove! I think</LINE>
<LINE>Foundations fly the wretched; such, I mean,</LINE>
<LINE>Where they should be relieved. Two beggars told me</LINE>
<LINE>I could not miss my way: will poor folks lie,</LINE>
<LINE>That have afflictions on them, knowing 'tis</LINE>
<LINE>A punishment or trial? Yes; no wonder,</LINE>
<LINE>When rich ones scarce tell true. To lapse in fulness</LINE>
<LINE>Is sorer than to lie for need, and falsehood</LINE>
<LINE>Is worse in kings than beggars. My dear lord!</LINE>
<LINE>Thou art one o' the false ones. Now I think on thee,</LINE>
<LINE>My hunger's gone; but even before, I was</LINE>
<LINE>At point to sink for food. But what is this?</LINE>
<LINE>Here is a path to't: 'tis some savage hold:</LINE>
<LINE>I were best not to call; I dare not call:</LINE>
<LINE>yet famine,</LINE>
<LINE>Ere clean it o'erthrow nature, makes it valiant,</LINE>
<LINE>Plenty and peace breeds cowards: hardness ever</LINE>
<LINE>Of hardiness is mother. Ho! who's here?</LINE>
<LINE>If any thing that's civil, speak; if savage,</LINE>
<LINE>Take or lend. Ho! No answer? Then I'll enter.</LINE>
<LINE>Best draw my sword: and if mine enemy</LINE>
<LINE>But fear the sword like me, he'll scarcely look on't.</LINE>
<LINE>Such a foe, good heavens!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit, to the cave</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>Enter BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BELARIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You, Polydote, have proved best woodman and</LINE>
<LINE>Are master of the feast: Cadwal and I</LINE>
<LINE>Will play the cook and servant; 'tis our match:</LINE>
<LINE>The sweat of industry would dry and die,</LINE>
<LINE>But for the end it works to. Come; our stomachs</LINE>
<LINE>Will make what's homely savoury: weariness</LINE>
<LINE>Can snore upon the flint, when resty sloth</LINE>
<LINE>Finds the down pillow hard. Now peace be here,</LINE>
<LINE>Poor house, that keep'st thyself!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUIDERIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am thoroughly weary.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARVIRAGUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am weak with toil, yet strong in appetite.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUIDERIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There is cold meat i' the cave; we'll browse on that,</LINE>
<LINE>Whilst what we have kill'd be cook'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BELARIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Looking into the cave</STAGEDIR></LINE>
<LINE>Stay; come not in.</LINE>
<LINE>But that it eats our victuals, I should think</LINE>
<LINE>Here were a fairy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUIDERIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What's the matter, sir?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BELARIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By Jupiter, an angel! or, if not,</LINE>
<LINE>An earthly paragon! Behold divineness</LINE>
<LINE>No elder than a boy!</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Re-enter IMOGEN</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good masters, harm me not:</LINE>
<LINE>Before I enter'd here, I call'd; and thought</LINE>
<LINE>To have begg'd or bought what I have took:</LINE>
<LINE>good troth,</LINE>
<LINE>I have stol'n nought, nor would not, though I had found</LINE>
<LINE>Gold strew'd i' the floor. Here's money for my meat:</LINE>
<LINE>I would have left it on the board so soon</LINE>
<LINE>As I had made my meal, and parted</LINE>
<LINE>With prayers for the provider.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUIDERIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Money, youth?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARVIRAGUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>All gold and silver rather turn to dirt!</LINE>
<LINE>As 'tis no better reckon'd, but of those</LINE>
<LINE>Who worship dirty gods.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I see you're angry:</LINE>
<LINE>Know, if you kill me for my fault, I should</LINE>
<LINE>Have died had I not made it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BELARIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Whither bound?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To Milford-Haven.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BELARIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What's your name?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fidele, sir. I have a kinsman who</LINE>
<LINE>Is bound for Italy; he embark'd at Milford;</LINE>
<LINE>To whom being going, almost spent with hunger,</LINE>
<LINE>I am fall'n in this offence.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BELARIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Prithee, fair youth,</LINE>
<LINE>Think us no churls, nor measure our good minds</LINE>
<LINE>By this rude place we live in. Well encounter'd!</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis almost night: you shall have better cheer</LINE>
<LINE>Ere you depart: and thanks to stay and eat it.</LINE>
<LINE>Boys, bid him welcome.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUIDERIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Were you a woman, youth,</LINE>
<LINE>I should woo hard but be your groom. In honesty,</LINE>
<LINE>I bid for you as I'd buy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARVIRAGUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll make't my comfort</LINE>
<LINE>He is a man; I'll love him as my brother:</LINE>
<LINE>And such a welcome as I'd give to him</LINE>
<LINE>After long absence, such is yours: most welcome!</LINE>
<LINE>Be sprightly, for you fall 'mongst friends.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Mongst friends,</LINE>
<LINE>If brothers.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Would it had been so, that they</LINE>
<LINE>Had been my father's sons! then had my prize</LINE>
<LINE>Been less, and so more equal ballasting</LINE>
<LINE>To thee, Posthumus.</LINE>

<LINE>Hark, boys.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Whispering</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Great men,</LINE>
<LINE>That had a court no bigger than this cave,</LINE>
<LINE>That did attend themselves and had the virtue</LINE>
<LINE>Which their own conscience seal'd them--laying by</LINE>
<LINE>That nothing-gift of differing multitudes--</LINE>
<LINE>Could not out-peer these twain. Pardon me, gods!</LINE>
<LINE>I'd change my sex to be companion with them,</LINE>
<LINE>Since Leonatus's false.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BELARIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It shall be so.</LINE>
<LINE>Boys, we'll go dress our hunt. Fair youth, come in:</LINE>
<LINE>Discourse is heavy, fasting; when we have supp'd,</LINE>
<LINE>We'll mannerly demand thee of thy story,</LINE>
<LINE>So far as thou wilt speak it.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter two Senators and Tribunes</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Senator</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is the tenor of the emperor's writ:</LINE>
<LINE>That since the common men are now in action</LINE>
<LINE>'Gainst the Pannonians and Dalmatians,</LINE>
<LINE>And that the legions now in Gallia are</LINE>
<LINE>Full weak to undertake our wars against</LINE>
<LINE>The fall'n-off Britons, that we do incite</LINE>
<LINE>The gentry to this business. He creates</LINE>
<LINE>Lucius preconsul: and to you the tribunes,</LINE>
<LINE>For this immediate levy, he commends</LINE>
<LINE>His absolute commission. Long live Caesar!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Tribune</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is Lucius general of the forces?</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Senator</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>First Tribune</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Remaining now in Gallia?</LINE>

<SPEAKER>First Senator</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With those legions</LINE>
<LINE>Which I have spoke of, whereunto your levy</LINE>
<LINE>Must be supplyant: the words of your commission</LINE>
<LINE>Will tie you to the numbers and the time</LINE>
<LINE>Of their dispatch.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter CLOTEN</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLOTEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am near to the place where they should meet, if</LINE>
<LINE>Pisanio have mapped it truly. How fit his garments</LINE>
<LINE>serve me! Why should his mistress, who was made by</LINE>
<LINE>him that made the tailor, not be fit too? the</LINE>
<LINE>rather--saving reverence of the word--for 'tis said</LINE>
<LINE>a woman's fitness comes by fits. Therein I must</LINE>
<LINE>play the workman. I dare speak it to myself--for it</LINE>
<LINE>is not vain-glory for a man and his glass to confer</LINE>
<LINE>in his own chamber--I mean, the lines of my body are</LINE>
<LINE>as well drawn as his; no less young, more strong,</LINE>
<LINE>not beneath him in fortunes, beyond him in the</LINE>
<LINE>advantage of the time, above him in birth, alike</LINE>
<LINE>conversant in general services, and more remarkable</LINE>
<LINE>in single oppositions: yet this imperceiverant</LINE>
<LINE>thing loves him in my despite. What mortality is!</LINE>
<LINE>Posthumus, thy head, which now is growing upon thy</LINE>
<LINE>shoulders, shall within this hour be off; thy</LINE>
<LINE>mistress enforced; thy garments cut to pieces before</LINE>
<LINE>thy face: and all this done, spurn her home to her</LINE>
<LINE>father; who may haply be a little angry for my so</LINE>
<LINE>rough usage; but my mother, having power of his</LINE>
<LINE>testiness, shall turn all into my commendations. My</LINE>
<LINE>horse is tied up safe: out, sword, and to a sore</LINE>
<LINE>purpose! Fortune, put them into my hand! This is</LINE>
<LINE>the very description of their meeting-place; and</LINE>
<LINE>the fellow dares not deceive me.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So man and man should be;</LINE>

<SPEAKER>GUIDERIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go you to hunting; I'll abide with him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So sick I am not, yet I am not well;</LINE>
<LINE>But not so citizen a wanton as</LINE>
<LINE>To seem to die ere sick: so please you, leave me;</LINE>
<LINE>Stick to your journal course: the breach of custom</LINE>
<LINE>Is breach of all. I am ill, but your being by me</LINE>
<LINE>Cannot amend me; society is no comfort</LINE>
<LINE>To one not sociable: I am not very sick,</LINE>
<LINE>Since I can reason of it. Pray you, trust me here:</LINE>
<LINE>I'll rob none but myself; and let me die,</LINE>
<LINE>Stealing so poorly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUIDERIUS</SPEAKER>

<LINE>I love this youth; and I have heard you say,</LINE>
<LINE>Love's reason's without reason: the bier at door,</LINE>
<LINE>And a demand who is't shall die, I'd say</LINE>
<LINE>'My father, not this youth.'</LINE>

<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR> O noble strain!</LINE>
<LINE>O worthiness of nature! breed of greatness!</LINE>
<LINE>Cowards father cowards and base things sire base:</LINE>
<LINE>Nature hath meal and bran, contempt and grace.</LINE>
<LINE>I'm not their father; yet who this should be,</LINE>

<LINE>Our courtiers say all's savage but at court:</LINE>
<LINE>Experience, O, thou disprovest report!</LINE>
<LINE>The imperious seas breed monsters, for the dish</LINE>
<LINE>Poor tributary rivers as sweet fish.</LINE>
<LINE>I am sick still; heart-sick. Pisanio,</LINE>

<LINE>And he her dieter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARVIRAGUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nobly he yokes</LINE>
<LINE>A smiling with a sigh, as if the sigh</LINE>
<LINE>Was that it was, for not being such a smile;</LINE>
<LINE>The smile mocking the sigh, that it would fly</LINE>
<LINE>From so divine a temple, to commix</LINE>
<LINE>With winds that sailors rail at.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUIDERIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do note</LINE>

<LINE>Means he not us? I partly know him: 'tis</LINE>
<LINE>Cloten, the son o' the queen. I fear some ambush.</LINE>
<LINE>I saw him not these many years, and yet</LINE>

<SPEAKER>GUIDERIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To who? to thee? What art thou? Have not I</LINE>
<LINE>An arm as big as thine? a heart as big?</LINE>
<LINE>Thy words, I grant, are bigger, for I wear not</LINE>
<LINE>My dagger in my mouth. Say what thou art,</LINE>
<LINE>Why I should yield to thee?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>Know'st me not by my clothes?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>No, nor thy tailor, rascal,</LINE>
<LINE>Who is thy grandfather: he made those clothes,</LINE>
<LINE>Which, as it seems, make thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Thou precious varlet,</LINE>
<LINE>My tailor made them not.</LINE>

<LINE>Hence, then, and thank</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLOTEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To thy further fear,</LINE>
<LINE>Nay, to thy mere confusion, thou shalt know</LINE>
<LINE>I am son to the queen.</LINE>

<LINE>Die the death:</LINE>
<LINE>When I have slain thee with my proper hand,</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Re-enter BELARIUS and ARVIRAGUS</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BELARIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No companies abroad?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARVIRAGUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>None in the world: you did mistake him, sure.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BELARIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I cannot tell: long is it since I saw him,</LINE>
<LINE>But time hath nothing blurr'd those lines of favour</LINE>
<LINE>Which then he wore; the snatches in his voice,</LINE>
<LINE>And burst of speaking, were as his: I am absolute</LINE>
<LINE>'Twas very Cloten.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARVIRAGUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In this place we left them:</LINE>
<LINE>I wish my brother make good time with him,</LINE>
<LINE>You say he is so fell.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BELARIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Being scarce made up,</LINE>
<LINE>I mean, to man, he had not apprehension</LINE>
<LINE>Of roaring terrors; for the effect of judgment</LINE>
<LINE>Is oft the cause of fear. But, see, thy brother.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Re-enter GUIDERIUS, with CLOTEN'S head</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUIDERIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This Cloten was a fool, an empty purse;</LINE>
<LINE>There was no money in't: not Hercules</LINE>
<LINE>Could have knock'd out his brains, for he had none:</LINE>
<LINE>Yet I not doing this, the fool had borne</LINE>
<LINE>My head as I do his.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BELARIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What hast thou done?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUIDERIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am perfect what: cut off one Cloten's head,</LINE>
<LINE>Son to the queen, after his own report;</LINE>
<LINE>Who call'd me traitor, mountaineer, and swore</LINE>
<LINE>With his own single hand he'ld take us in</LINE>
<LINE>Displace our heads where--thank the gods!--they grow,</LINE>
<LINE>And set them on Lud's-town.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BELARIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We are all undone.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUIDERIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, worthy father, what have we to lose,</LINE>
<LINE>But that he swore to take, our lives? The law</LINE>
<LINE>Protects not us: then why should we be tender</LINE>
<LINE>To let an arrogant piece of flesh threat us,</LINE>
<LINE>Play judge and executioner all himself,</LINE>
<LINE>For we do fear the law? What company</LINE>
<LINE>Discover you abroad?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BELARIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No single soul</LINE>
<LINE>Can we set eye on; but in all safe reason</LINE>
<LINE>He must have some attendants. Though his humour</LINE>
<LINE>Was nothing but mutation, ay, and that</LINE>
<LINE>From one bad thing to worse; not frenzy, not</LINE>
<LINE>Absolute madness could so far have raved</LINE>
<LINE>To bring him here alone; although perhaps</LINE>
<LINE>It may be heard at court that such as we</LINE>
<LINE>Cave here, hunt here, are outlaws, and in time</LINE>
<LINE>May make some stronger head; the which he hearing--</LINE>
<LINE>As it is like him--might break out, and swear</LINE>
<LINE>He'ld fetch us in; yet is't not probable</LINE>
<LINE>To come alone, either he so undertaking,</LINE>
<LINE>Or they so suffering: then on good ground we fear,</LINE>
<LINE>If we do fear this body hath a tail</LINE>
<LINE>More perilous than the head.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARVIRAGUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let ordinance</LINE>
<LINE>Come as the gods foresay it: howsoe'er,</LINE>
<LINE>My brother hath done well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BELARIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I had no mind</LINE>
<LINE>To hunt this day: the boy Fidele's sickness</LINE>
<LINE>Did make my way long forth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUIDERIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With his own sword,</LINE>
<LINE>Which he did wave against my throat, I have ta'en</LINE>
<LINE>His head from him: I'll throw't into the creek</LINE>
<LINE>Behind our rock; and let it to the sea,</LINE>
<LINE>And tell the fishes he's the queen's son, Cloten:</LINE>
<LINE>That's all I reck.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BELARIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I fear 'twill be revenged:</LINE>
<LINE>Would, Polydote, thou hadst not done't! though valour</LINE>
<LINE>Becomes thee well enough.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARVIRAGUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Would I had done't</LINE>
<LINE>So the revenge alone pursued me! Polydore,</LINE>
<LINE>I love thee brotherly, but envy much</LINE>
<LINE>Thou hast robb'd me of this deed: I would revenges,</LINE>
<LINE>That possible strength might meet, would seek us through</LINE>
<LINE>And put us to our answer.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BELARIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, 'tis done:</LINE>
<LINE>We'll hunt no more to-day, nor seek for danger</LINE>
<LINE>Where there's no profit. I prithee, to our rock;</LINE>
<LINE>You and Fidele play the cooks: I'll stay</LINE>
<LINE>Till hasty Polydote return, and bring him</LINE>
<LINE>To dinner presently.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARVIRAGUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Poor sick Fidele!</LINE>
<LINE>I'll weringly to him: to gain his colour</LINE>
<LINE>I'ld let a parish of such Clotens' blood,</LINE>
<LINE>And praise myself for charity.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BELARIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O thou goddess,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou divine Nature, how thyself thou blazon'st</LINE>
<LINE>In these two princely boys! They are as gentle</LINE>
<LINE>As zephyrs blowing below the violet,</LINE>
<LINE>Not wagging his sweet head; and yet as rough,</LINE>
<LINE>Their royal blood enchafed, as the rudest wind,</LINE>
<LINE>That by the top doth take the mountain pine,</LINE>
<LINE>And make him stoop to the vale. 'Tis wonder</LINE>
<LINE>That an invisible instinct should frame them</LINE>
<LINE>To royalty unlearn'd, honour untaught,</LINE>
<LINE>Civility not seen from other, valour</LINE>
<LINE>That wildly grows in them, but yields a crop</LINE>
<LINE>As if it had been sow'd. Yet still it's strange</LINE>
<LINE>What Cloten's being here to us portends,</LINE>
<LINE>Or what his death will bring us.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Re-enter GUIDERIUS</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUIDERIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where's my brother?</LINE>
<LINE>I have sent Cloten's clotpoll down the stream,</LINE>
<LINE>In embassy to his mother: his body's hostage</LINE>
<LINE>For his return.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Solemn music</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BELARIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My ingenious instrument!</LINE>
<LINE>Hark, Polydore, it sounds! But what occasion</LINE>
<LINE>Hath Cadwal now to give it motion? Hark!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUIDERIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is he at home?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BELARIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He went hence even now.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUIDERIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What does he mean? since death of my dear'st mother</LINE>
<LINE>it did not speak before. All solemn things</LINE>
<LINE>Should answer solemn accidents. The matter?</LINE>
<LINE>Triumphs for nothing and lamenting toys</LINE>
<LINE>Is jollity for apes and grief for boys.</LINE>
<LINE>Is Cadwal mad?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BELARIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Look, here he comes,</LINE>
<LINE>And brings the dire occasion in his arms</LINE>
<LINE>Of what we blame him for.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Re-enter ARVIRAGUS, with IMOGEN, as dead,
bearing her in his arms</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARVIRAGUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The bird is dead</LINE>
<LINE>That we have made so much on. I had rather</LINE>
<LINE>Have skipp'd from sixteen years of age to sixty,</LINE>
<LINE>To have turn'd my leaping-time into a crutch,</LINE>
<LINE>Than have seen this.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUIDERIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O sweetest, fairest lily!</LINE>
<LINE>My brother wears thee not the one half so well</LINE>
<LINE>As when thou grew'st thyself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BELARIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O melancholy!</LINE>
<LINE>Who ever yet could sound thy bottom? find</LINE>
<LINE>The ooze, to show what coast thy sluggish crare</LINE>
<LINE>Might easiliest harbour in? Thou blessed thing!</LINE>
<LINE>Jove knows what man thou mightst have made; but I,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou diedst, a most rare boy, of melancholy.</LINE>
<LINE>How found you him?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARVIRAGUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Stark, as you see:</LINE>
<LINE>Thus smiling, as some fly hid tickled slumber,</LINE>
<LINE>Not as death's dart, being laugh'd at; his</LINE>
<LINE>right cheek</LINE>
<LINE>Reposing on a cushion.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUIDERIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARVIRAGUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O' the floor;</LINE>
<LINE>His arms thus leagued: I thought he slept, and put</LINE>
<LINE>My clouted brogues from off my feet, whose rudeness</LINE>
<LINE>Answer'd my steps too loud.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUIDERIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, he but sleeps:</LINE>
<LINE>If he be gone, he'll make his grave a bed;</LINE>
<LINE>With female fairies will his tomb be haunted,</LINE>
<LINE>And worms will not come to thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARVIRAGUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With fairest flowers</LINE>
<LINE>Whilst summer lasts and I live here, Fidele,</LINE>
<LINE>I'll sweeten thy sad grave: thou shalt not lack</LINE>
<LINE>The flower that's like thy face, pale primrose, nor</LINE>
<LINE>The azured harebell, like thy veins, no, nor</LINE>
<LINE>The leaf of eglantine, whom not to slander,</LINE>
<LINE>Out-sweeten'd not thy breath: the ruddock would,</LINE>
<LINE>With charitable bill,--O bill, sore-shaming</LINE>
<LINE>Those rich-left heirs that let their fathers lie</LINE>
<LINE>Without a monument!--bring thee all this;</LINE>
<LINE>Yea, and furr'd moss besides, when flowers are none,</LINE>
<LINE>To winter-ground thy corse.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUIDERIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Prithee, have done;</LINE>
<LINE>And do not play in wench-like words with that</LINE>
<LINE>Which is so serious. Let us bury him,</LINE>
<LINE>And not protract with admiration what</LINE>
<LINE>Is now due debt. To the grave!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARVIRAGUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Say, where shall's lay him?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUIDERIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By good Euriphile, our mother.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARVIRAGUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Be't so:</LINE>
<LINE>And let us, Polydore, though now our voices</LINE>
<LINE>Have got the mannish crack, sing him to the ground,</LINE>
<LINE>As once our mother; use like note and words,</LINE>
<LINE>Save that Euriphile must be Fidele.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUIDERIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Cadwal,</LINE>
<LINE>I cannot sing: I'll weep, and word it with thee;</LINE>
<LINE>For notes of sorrow out of tune are worse</LINE>
<LINE>Than priests and fanes that lie.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARVIRAGUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We'll speak it, then.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BELARIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Great griefs, I see, medicine the less; for Cloten</LINE>
<LINE>Is quite forgot. He was a queen's son, boys;</LINE>
<LINE>And though he came our enemy, remember</LINE>
<LINE>He was paid for that: though mean and</LINE>
<LINE>mighty, rotting</LINE>
<LINE>Together, have one dust, yet reverence,</LINE>
<LINE>That angel of the world, doth make distinction</LINE>
<LINE>Of place 'tween high and low. Our foe was princely</LINE>
<LINE>And though you took his life, as being our foe,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet bury him as a prince.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUIDERIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pray You, fetch him hither.</LINE>
<LINE>Thersites' body is as good as Ajax',</LINE>
<LINE>When neither are alive.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARVIRAGUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If you'll go fetch him,</LINE>
<LINE>We'll say our song the whilst. Brother, begin.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit BELARIUS</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUIDERIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, Cadwal, we must lay his head to the east;</LINE>
<LINE>My father hath a reason for't.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARVIRAGUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis true.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUIDERIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come on then, and remove him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARVIRAGUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So. Begin.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUIDERIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fear no more the heat o' the sun,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor the furious winter's rages;</LINE>
<LINE>Thou thy worldly task hast done,</LINE>
<LINE>Home art gone, and ta'en thy wages:</LINE>
<LINE>Golden lads and girls all must,</LINE>
<LINE>As chimney-sweepers, come to dust.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARVIRAGUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fear no more the frown o' the great;</LINE>
<LINE>Thou art past the tyrant's stroke;</LINE>
<LINE>Care no more to clothe and eat;</LINE>
<LINE>To thee the reed is as the oak:</LINE>
<LINE>The sceptre, learning, physic, must</LINE>
<LINE>All follow this, and come to dust.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUIDERIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fear no more the lightning flash,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARVIRAGUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nor the all-dreaded thunder-stone;</LINE>

<LINE>Fear not slander, censure rash;</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<LINE>All lovers young, all lovers must</LINE>
<LINE>Consign to thee, and come to dust.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUIDERIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No exorciser harm thee!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARVIRAGUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nor no witchcraft charm thee!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>Quiet consummation have;</LINE>
<LINE>And renowned be thy grave!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Re-enter BELARIUS, with the body of CLOTEN</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUIDERIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We have done our obsequies: come, lay him down.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BELARIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here's a few flowers; but 'bout midnight, more:</LINE>
<LINE>The herbs that have on them cold dew o' the night</LINE>
<LINE>Are strewings fitt'st for graves. Upon their faces.</LINE>
<LINE>You were as flowers, now wither'd: even so</LINE>
<LINE>These herblets shall, which we upon you strew.</LINE>
<LINE>Come on, away: apart upon our knees.</LINE>
<LINE>The ground that gave them first has them again:</LINE>
<LINE>Their pleasures here are past, so is their pain.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Awaking</STAGEDIR>  Yes, sir, to Milford-Haven; which is</LINE>
<LINE>the way?--</LINE>
<LINE>I thank you.--By yond bush?--Pray, how far thither?</LINE>
<LINE>'Ods pittikins! can it be six mile yet?--</LINE>
<LINE>I have gone all night. 'Faith, I'll lie down and sleep.</LINE>
<LINE>But, soft! no bedfellow!--O gods and goddesses!</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Seeing the body of CLOTEN</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>These flowers are like the pleasures of the world;</LINE>
<LINE>This bloody man, the care on't. I hope I dream;</LINE>
<LINE>For so I thought I was a cave-keeper,</LINE>
<LINE>And cook to honest creatures: but 'tis not so;</LINE>
<LINE>'Twas but a bolt of nothing, shot at nothing,</LINE>
<LINE>Which the brain makes of fumes: our very eyes</LINE>
<LINE>Are sometimes like our judgments, blind. Good faith,</LINE>
<LINE>I tremble stiff with fear: but if there be</LINE>
<LINE>Yet left in heaven as small a drop of pity</LINE>
<LINE>As a wren's eye, fear'd gods, a part of it!</LINE>
<LINE>The dream's here still: even when I wake, it is</LINE>
<LINE>Without me, as within me; not imagined, felt.</LINE>
<LINE>A headless man! The garments of Posthumus!</LINE>
<LINE>I know the shape of's leg: this is his hand;</LINE>
<LINE>His foot Mercurial; his Martial thigh;</LINE>
<LINE>The brawns of Hercules: but his Jovial face</LINE>
<LINE>Murder in heaven?--How!--'Tis gone. Pisanio,</LINE>
<LINE>All curses madded Hecuba gave the Greeks,</LINE>
<LINE>And mine to boot, be darted on thee! Thou,</LINE>
<LINE>Conspired with that irregulous devil, Cloten,</LINE>
<LINE>Hast here cut off my lord. To write and read</LINE>
<LINE>Be henceforth treacherous! Damn'd Pisanio</LINE>
<LINE>Hath with his forged letters,--damn'd Pisanio--</LINE>
<LINE>From this most bravest vessel of the world</LINE>
<LINE>Struck the main-top! O Posthumus! alas,</LINE>
<LINE>Where is thy head? where's that? Ay me!</LINE>
<LINE>where's that?</LINE>
<LINE>Pisanio might have kill'd thee at the heart,</LINE>
<LINE>And left this head on. How should this be? Pisanio?</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis he and Cloten: malice and lucre in them</LINE>
<LINE>Have laid this woe here. O, 'tis pregnant, pregnant!</LINE>
<LINE>The drug he gave me, which he said was precious</LINE>
<LINE>And cordial to me, have I not found it</LINE>
<LINE>Murderous to the senses? That confirms it home:</LINE>
<LINE>This is Pisanio's deed, and Cloten's: O!</LINE>
<LINE>Give colour to my pale cheek with thy blood,</LINE>
<LINE>That we the horrider may seem to those</LINE>
<LINE>Which chance to find us: O, my lord, my lord!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Falls on the body</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>Enter LUCIUS, a Captain and other Officers,
and a Soothsayer</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Captain</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To them the legions garrison'd in Gailia,</LINE>
<LINE>After your will, have cross'd the sea, attending</LINE>
<LINE>You here at Milford-Haven with your ships:</LINE>
<LINE>They are in readiness.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAIUS LUCIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But what from Rome?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Captain</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The senate hath stirr'd up the confiners</LINE>
<LINE>And gentlemen of Italy, most willing spirits,</LINE>
<LINE>That promise noble service: and they come</LINE>
<LINE>Under the conduct of bold Iachimo,</LINE>
<LINE>Syenna's brother.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAIUS LUCIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>When expect you them?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Captain</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With the next benefit o' the wind.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAIUS LUCIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This forwardness</LINE>
<LINE>Makes our hopes fair. Command our present numbers</LINE>
<LINE>Be muster'd; bid the captains look to't. Now, sir,</LINE>
<LINE>What have you dream'd of late of this war's purpose?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Soothsayer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Last night the very gods show'd me a vision--</LINE>
<LINE>I fast and pray'd for their intelligence--thus:</LINE>
<LINE>I saw Jove's bird, the Roman eagle, wing'd</LINE>
<LINE>From the spongy south to this part of the west,</LINE>
<LINE>There vanish'd in the sunbeams: which portends--</LINE>
<LINE>Unless my sins abuse my divination--</LINE>
<LINE>Success to the Roman host.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAIUS LUCIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Dream often so,</LINE>
<LINE>And never false. Soft, ho! what trunk is here</LINE>
<LINE>Without his top? The ruin speaks that sometime</LINE>
<LINE>It was a worthy building. How! a page!</LINE>
<LINE>Or dead, or sleeping on him? But dead rather;</LINE>
<LINE>For nature doth abhor to make his bed</LINE>
<LINE>With the defunct, or sleep upon the dead.</LINE>
<LINE>Let's see the boy's face.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Captain</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He's alive, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAIUS LUCIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He'll then instruct us of this body. Young one,</LINE>
<LINE>Inform us of thy fortunes, for it seems</LINE>
<LINE>They crave to be demanded. Who is this</LINE>
<LINE>Thou makest thy bloody pillow? Or who was he</LINE>
<LINE>That, otherwise than noble nature did,</LINE>
<LINE>Hath alter'd that good picture? What's thy interest</LINE>
<LINE>In this sad wreck? How came it? Who is it?</LINE>
<LINE>What art thou?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am nothing: or if not,</LINE>
<LINE>Nothing to be were better. This was my master,</LINE>
<LINE>A very valiant Briton and a good,</LINE>
<LINE>That here by mountaineers lies slain. Alas!</LINE>
<LINE>There is no more such masters: I may wander</LINE>
<LINE>From east to occident, cry out for service,</LINE>
<LINE>Try many, all good, serve truly, never</LINE>
<LINE>Find such another master.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAIUS LUCIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Lack, good youth!</LINE>
<LINE>Thou movest no less with thy complaining than</LINE>
<LINE>Thy master in bleeding: say his name, good friend.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Richard du Champ.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>If I do lie and do</LINE>
<LINE>No harm by it, though the gods hear, I hope</LINE>
<LINE>They'll pardon it.--Say you, sir?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAIUS LUCIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thy name?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fidele, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAIUS LUCIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou dost approve thyself the very same:</LINE>
<LINE>Thy name well fits thy faith, thy faith thy name.</LINE>
<LINE>Wilt take thy chance with me? I will not say</LINE>
<LINE>Thou shalt be so well master'd, but, be sure,</LINE>
<LINE>No less beloved. The Roman emperor's letters,</LINE>
<LINE>Sent by a consul to me, should not sooner</LINE>
<LINE>Than thine own worth prefer thee: go with me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll follow, sir. But first, an't please the gods,</LINE>
<LINE>I'll hide my master from the flies, as deep</LINE>
<LINE>As these poor pickaxes can dig; and when</LINE>
<LINE>With wild wood-leaves and weeds I ha' strew'd his grave,</LINE>
<LINE>And on it said a century of prayers,</LINE>
<LINE>Such as I can, twice o'er, I'll weep and sigh;</LINE>
<LINE>And leaving so his service, follow you,</LINE>
<LINE>So please you entertain me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAIUS LUCIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, good youth!</LINE>
<LINE>And rather father thee than master thee.</LINE>
<LINE>My friends,</LINE>
<LINE>The boy hath taught us manly duties: let us</LINE>
<LINE>Find out the prettiest daisied plot we can,</LINE>
<LINE>And make him with our pikes and partisans</LINE>
<LINE>A grave: come, arm him. Boy, he is preferr'd</LINE>

<LINE>As soldiers can. Be cheerful; wipe thine eyes</LINE>

<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Again; and bring me word how 'tis with her.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit an Attendant</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>A fever with the absence of her son,</LINE>
<LINE>A madness, of which her life's in danger. Heavens,</LINE>
<LINE>How deeply you at once do touch me! Imogen,</LINE>
<LINE>The great part of my comfort, gone; my queen</LINE>
<LINE>Upon a desperate bed, and in a time</LINE>
<LINE>When fearful wars point at me; her son gone,</LINE>
<LINE>So needful for this present: it strikes me, past</LINE>
<LINE>The hope of comfort. But for thee, fellow,</LINE>
<LINE>Who needs must know of her departure and</LINE>
<LINE>Dost seem so ignorant, we'll enforce it from thee</LINE>
<LINE>By a sharp torture.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PISANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, my life is yours;</LINE>
<LINE>I humbly set it at your will; but, for my mistress,</LINE>
<LINE>I nothing know where she remains, why gone,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor when she purposes return. Beseech your highness,</LINE>
<LINE>Hold me your loyal servant.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good my liege,</LINE>
<LINE>The day that she was missing he was here:</LINE>
<LINE>I dare be bound he's true and shall perform</LINE>
<LINE>All parts of his subjection loyally. For Cloten,</LINE>
<LINE>There wants no diligence in seeking him,</LINE>
<LINE>And will, no doubt, be found.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The time is troublesome.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>To PISANIO</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>We'll slip you for a season; but our jealousy</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So please your majesty,</LINE>
<LINE>The Roman legions, all from Gallia drawn,</LINE>
<LINE>Are landed on your coast, with a supply</LINE>
<LINE>Of Roman gentlemen, by the senate sent.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now for the counsel of my son and queen!</LINE>
<LINE>I am amazed with matter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good my liege,</LINE>
<LINE>Your preparation can affront no less</LINE>
<LINE>Than what you hear of: come more, for more</LINE>
<LINE>you're ready:</LINE>
<LINE>The want is but to put those powers in motion</LINE>
<LINE>That long to move.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I thank you. Let's withdraw;</LINE>
<LINE>And meet the time as it seeks us. We fear not</LINE>
<LINE>What can from Italy annoy us; but</LINE>
<LINE>We grieve at chances here. Away!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt all but PISANIO</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PISANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I heard no letter from my master since</LINE>
<LINE>I wrote him Imogen was slain: 'tis strange:</LINE>
<LINE>Nor hear I from my mistress who did promise</LINE>
<LINE>To yield me often tidings: neither know I</LINE>
<LINE>What is betid to Cloten; but remain</LINE>
<LINE>Perplex'd in all. The heavens still must work.</LINE>
<LINE>Wherein I am false I am honest; not true, to be true.</LINE>
<LINE>These present wars shall find I love my country,</LINE>
<LINE>Even to the note o' the king, or I'll fall in them.</LINE>
<LINE>All other doubts, by time let them be clear'd:</LINE>

<LINE>Let us from it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARVIRAGUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What pleasure, sir, find we in life, to lock it</LINE>
<LINE>From action and adventure?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUIDERIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, what hope</LINE>
<LINE>Have we in hiding us? This way, the Romans</LINE>
<LINE>Must or for Britons slay us, or receive us</LINE>
<LINE>For barbarous and unnatural revolts</LINE>
<LINE>During their use, and slay us after.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BELARIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sons,</LINE>
<LINE>We'll higher to the mountains; there secure us.</LINE>
<LINE>To the king's party there's no going: newness</LINE>
<LINE>Of Cloten's death--we being not known, not muster'd</LINE>
<LINE>Among the bands--may drive us to a render</LINE>
<LINE>Where we have lived, and so extort from's that</LINE>
<LINE>Which we have done, whose answer would be death</LINE>
<LINE>Drawn on with torture.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUIDERIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is, sir, a doubt</LINE>
<LINE>In such a time nothing becoming you,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor satisfying us.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARVIRAGUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is not likely</LINE>
<LINE>That when they hear the Roman horses neigh,</LINE>
<LINE>Behold their quarter'd fires, have both their eyes</LINE>
<LINE>And ears so cloy'd importantly as now,</LINE>
<LINE>That they will waste their time upon our note,</LINE>
<LINE>To know from whence we are.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BELARIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, I am known</LINE>
<LINE>Of many in the army: many years,</LINE>
<LINE>Though Cloten then but young, you see, not wore him</LINE>
<LINE>From my remembrance. And, besides, the king</LINE>
<LINE>Hath not deserved my service nor your loves;</LINE>
<LINE>Who find in my exile the want of breeding,</LINE>
<LINE>The certainty of this hard life; aye hopeless</LINE>
<LINE>To have the courtesy your cradle promised,</LINE>
<LINE>But to be still hot summer's tamings and</LINE>
<LINE>The shrinking slaves of winter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUIDERIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Than be so</LINE>
<LINE>Better to cease to be. Pray, sir, to the army:</LINE>
<LINE>I and my brother are not known; yourself</LINE>
<LINE>So out of thought, and thereto so o'ergrown,</LINE>
<LINE>Cannot be question'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARVIRAGUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By this sun that shines,</LINE>
<LINE>I'll thither: what thing is it that I never</LINE>
<LINE>Did see man die! scarce ever look'd on blood,</LINE>
<LINE>But that of coward hares, hot goats, and venison!</LINE>
<LINE>Never bestrid a horse, save one that had</LINE>
<LINE>A rider like myself, who ne'er wore rowel</LINE>
<LINE>Nor iron on his heel! I am ashamed</LINE>
<LINE>To look upon the holy sun, to have</LINE>
<LINE>The benefit of his blest beams, remaining</LINE>
<LINE>So long a poor unknown.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUIDERIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By heavens, I'll go:</LINE>
<LINE>If you will bless me, sir, and give me leave,</LINE>
<LINE>I'll take the better care, but if you will not,</LINE>
<LINE>The hazard therefore due fall on me by</LINE>
<LINE>The hands of Romans!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARVIRAGUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So say I amen.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BELARIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No reason I, since of your lives you set</LINE>
<LINE>So slight a valuation, should reserve</LINE>
<LINE>My crack'd one to more care. Have with you, boys!</LINE>
<LINE>If in your country wars you chance to die,</LINE>
<LINE>That is my bed too, lads, an there I'll lie:</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yea, bloody cloth, I'll keep thee, for I wish'd</LINE>
<LINE>Thou shouldst be colour'd thus. You married ones,</LINE>
<LINE>If each of you should take this course, how many</LINE>
<LINE>Must murder wives much better than themselves</LINE>
<LINE>For wrying but a little! O Pisanio!</LINE>
<LINE>Every good servant does not all commands:</LINE>
<LINE>No bond but to do just ones. Gods! if you</LINE>
<LINE>Should have ta'en vengeance on my faults, I never</LINE>
<LINE>Had lived to put on this: so had you saved</LINE>
<LINE>The noble Imogen to repent, and struck</LINE>
<LINE>Me, wretch more worth your vengeance. But, alack,</LINE>
<LINE>You snatch some hence for little faults; that's love,</LINE>
<LINE>To have them fall no more: you some permit</LINE>
<LINE>To second ills with ills, each elder worse,</LINE>
<LINE>And make them dread it, to the doers' thrift.</LINE>
<LINE>But Imogen is your own: do your best wills,</LINE>
<LINE>And make me blest to obey! I am brought hither</LINE>
<LINE>Among the Italian gentry, and to fight</LINE>
<LINE>Against my lady's kingdom: 'tis enough</LINE>
<LINE>That, Britain, I have kill'd thy mistress; peace!</LINE>
<LINE>I'll give no wound to thee. Therefore, good heavens,</LINE>
<LINE>Hear patiently my purpose: I'll disrobe me</LINE>
<LINE>Of these Italian weeds and suit myself</LINE>
<LINE>As does a Briton peasant: so I'll fight</LINE>
<LINE>Against the part I come with; so I'll die</LINE>
<LINE>For thee, O Imogen, even for whom my life</LINE>
<LINE>Is every breath a death; and thus, unknown,</LINE>
<LINE>Pitied nor hated, to the face of peril</LINE>
<LINE>Myself I'll dedicate. Let me make men know</LINE>
<LINE>More valour in me than my habits show.</LINE>
<LINE>Gods, put the strength o' the Leonati in me!</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter, from one side, LUCIUS, IACHIMO, and
the Roman Army: from the other side, the
British Army; POSTHUMUS LEONATUS following,
like a poor soldier. They march over and go
out. Then enter again, in skirmish, IACHIMO
and POSTHUMUS LEONATUS he vanquisheth and disarmeth
IACHIMO, and then leaves him</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IACHIMO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The heaviness and guilt within my bosom</LINE>
<LINE>Takes off my manhood: I have belied a lady,</LINE>
<LINE>The princess of this country, and the air on't</LINE>
<LINE>Revengingly enfeebles me; or could this carl,</LINE>
<LINE>A very drudge of nature's, have subdued me</LINE>
<LINE>In my profession? Knighthoods and honours, borne</LINE>
<LINE>As I wear mine, are titles but of scorn.</LINE>
<LINE>If that thy gentry, Britain, go before</LINE>
<LINE>This lout as he exceeds our lords, the odds</LINE>
<LINE>Is that we scarce are men and you are gods.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Camest thou from where they made the stand?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I did.</LINE>
<LINE>Though you, it seems, come from the fliers.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I did.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No blame be to you, sir; for all was lost,</LINE>
<LINE>But that the heavens fought: the king himself</LINE>
<LINE>Of his wings destitute, the army broken,</LINE>
<LINE>And but the backs of Britons seen, all flying</LINE>
<LINE>Through a straight lane; the enemy full-hearted,</LINE>
<LINE>Lolling the tongue with slaughtering, having work</LINE>
<LINE>More plentiful than tools to do't, struck down</LINE>
<LINE>Some mortally, some slightly touch'd, some falling</LINE>
<LINE>Merely through fear; that the straight pass was damm'd</LINE>
<LINE>With dead men hurt behind, and cowards living</LINE>
<LINE>To die with lengthen'd shame.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where was this lane?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Close by the battle, ditch'd, and wall'd with turf;</LINE>
<LINE>Which gave advantage to an ancient soldier,</LINE>
<LINE>An honest one, I warrant; who deserved</LINE>
<LINE>So long a breeding as his white beard came to,</LINE>
<LINE>In doing this for's country: athwart the lane,</LINE>
<LINE>He, with two striplings-lads more like to run</LINE>
<LINE>The country base than to commit such slaughter</LINE>
<LINE>With faces fit for masks, or rather fairer</LINE>
<LINE>Than those for preservation cased, or shame--</LINE>
<LINE>Made good the passage; cried to those that fled,</LINE>
<LINE>'Our Britain s harts die flying, not our men:</LINE>
<LINE>To darkness fleet souls that fly backwards. Stand;</LINE>
<LINE>Or we are Romans and will give you that</LINE>
<LINE>Like beasts which you shun beastly, and may save,</LINE>
<LINE>But to look back in frown: stand, stand.'</LINE>
<LINE>These three,</LINE>
<LINE>Three thousand confident, in act as many--</LINE>
<LINE>For three performers are the file when all</LINE>
<LINE>The rest do nothing--with this word 'Stand, stand,'</LINE>
<LINE>Accommodated by the place, more charming</LINE>
<LINE>With their own nobleness, which could have turn'd</LINE>
<LINE>A distaff to a lance, gilded pale looks,</LINE>
<LINE>Part shame, part spirit renew'd; that some,</LINE>
<LINE>turn'd coward</LINE>
<LINE>But by example--O, a sin in war,</LINE>
<LINE>Damn'd in the first beginners!--gan to look</LINE>
<LINE>The way that they did, and to grin like lions</LINE>
<LINE>Upon the pikes o' the hunters. Then began</LINE>
<LINE>A stop i' the chaser, a retire, anon</LINE>
<LINE>A rout, confusion thick; forthwith they fly</LINE>
<LINE>Chickens, the way which they stoop'd eagles; slaves,</LINE>
<LINE>The strides they victors made: and now our cowards,</LINE>
<LINE>Like fragments in hard voyages, became</LINE>
<LINE>The life o' the need: having found the backdoor open</LINE>
<LINE>Of the unguarded hearts, heavens, how they wound!</LINE>
<LINE>Some slain before; some dying; some their friends</LINE>
<LINE>O'er borne i' the former wave: ten, chased by one,</LINE>
<LINE>Are now each one the slaughter-man of twenty:</LINE>
<LINE>Those that would die or ere resist are grown</LINE>
<LINE>The mortal bugs o' the field.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, do not wonder at it: you are made</LINE>
<LINE>Rather to wonder at the things you hear</LINE>
<LINE>Than to work any. Will you rhyme upon't,</LINE>
<LINE>And vent it for a mockery? Here is one:</LINE>
<LINE>'Two boys, an old man twice a boy, a lane,</LINE>
<LINE>Preserved the Britons, was the Romans' bane.'</LINE>

<LINE>To-day how many would have given their honours</LINE>
<LINE>To have saved their carcasses! took heel to do't,</LINE>
<LINE>And yet died too! I, in mine own woe charm'd,</LINE>
<LINE>Could not find death where I did hear him groan,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor feel him where he struck: being an ugly monster,</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis strange he hides him in fresh cups, soft beds,</LINE>
<LINE>Sweet words; or hath more ministers than we</LINE>
<LINE>That draw his knives i' the war. Well, I will find him</LINE>
<LINE>For being now a favourer to the Briton,</LINE>
<LINE>No more a Briton, I have resumed again</LINE>
<LINE>The part I came in: fight I will no more,</LINE>
<LINE>But yield me to the veriest hind that shall</LINE>
<LINE>Once touch my shoulder. Great the slaughter is</LINE>
<LINE>Here made by the Roman; great the answer be</LINE>
<LINE>Britons must take. For me, my ransom's death;</LINE>
<LINE>On either side I come to spend my breath;</LINE>

<SPEAKER>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Most welcome, bondage! for thou art away,</LINE>
<LINE>think, to liberty: yet am I better</LINE>
<LINE>Than one that's sick o' the gout; since he had rather</LINE>
<LINE>Groan so in perpetuity than be cured</LINE>
<LINE>By the sure physician, death, who is the key</LINE>
<LINE>To unbar these locks. My conscience, thou art fetter'd</LINE>
<LINE>More than my shanks and wrists: you good gods, give me</LINE>
<LINE>The penitent instrument to pick that bolt,</LINE>
<LINE>Then, free for ever! Is't enough I am sorry?</LINE>
<LINE>So children temporal fathers do appease;</LINE>
<LINE>Gods are more full of mercy. Must I repent?</LINE>
<LINE>I cannot do it better than in gyves,</LINE>
<LINE>Desired more than constrain'd: to satisfy,</LINE>
<LINE>If of my freedom 'tis the main part, take</LINE>
<LINE>No stricter render of me than my all.</LINE>
<LINE>I know you are more clement than vile men,</LINE>
<LINE>Who of their broken debtors take a third,</LINE>
<LINE>A sixth, a tenth, letting them thrive again</LINE>
<LINE>On their abatement: that's not my desire:</LINE>
<LINE>For Imogen's dear life take mine; and though</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis not so dear, yet 'tis a life; you coin'd it:</LINE>
<LINE>'Tween man and man they weigh not every stamp;</LINE>
<LINE>Though light, take pieces for the figure's sake:</LINE>
<LINE>You rather mine, being yours: and so, great powers,</LINE>
<LINE>If you will take this audit, take this life,</LINE>
<LINE>And cancel these cold bonds. O Imogen!</LINE>
<LINE>I'll speak to thee in silence.</LINE>

his hand an ancient matron, his wife, and mother
to Posthumus Leonatus, with music before them:
then, after other music, follow the two young
Leonati, brothers to Posthumus Leonatus, with
wounds as they died in the wars. They circle
Posthumus Leonatus round, as he lies sleeping</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>With marriage wherefore was he mock'd,</LINE>

<LINE>From Leonati seat, and cast</LINE>
<LINE>From her his dearest one,</LINE>
<LINE>Sweet Imogen?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Sicilius Leonatus</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why did you suffer Iachimo,</LINE>
<LINE>Slight thing of Italy,</LINE>
<LINE>To taint his nobler heart and brain</LINE>
<LINE>With needless jealosy;</LINE>
<LINE>And to become the geck and scorn</LINE>

<LINE>For this from stiller seats we came,</LINE>

<LINE>Our fealty and Tenantius' right</LINE>
<LINE>With honour to maintain.</LINE>

<LINE>Like hardiment Posthumus hath</LINE>
<LINE>To Cymbeline perform'd:</LINE>
<LINE>Then, Jupiter, thou king of gods,</LINE>
<LINE>Why hast thou thus adjourn'd</LINE>
<LINE>The graces for his merits due,</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Jupiter descends in thunder and lightning, sitting
upon an eagle: he throws a thunderbolt. The
Apparitions fall on their knees</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Jupiter</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No more, you petty spirits of region low,</LINE>
<LINE>Offend our hearing; hush! How dare you ghosts</LINE>
<LINE>Accuse the thunderer, whose bolt, you know,</LINE>
<LINE>Sky-planted batters all rebelling coasts?</LINE>
<LINE>Poor shadows of Elysium, hence, and rest</LINE>
<LINE>Upon your never-withering banks of flowers:</LINE>
<LINE>Be not with mortal accidents opprest;</LINE>
<LINE>No care of yours it is; you know 'tis ours.</LINE>
<LINE>Whom best I love I cross; to make my gift,</LINE>
<LINE>The more delay'd, delighted. Be content;</LINE>
<LINE>Your low-laid son our godhead will uplift:</LINE>
<LINE>His comforts thrive, his trials well are spent.</LINE>
<LINE>Our Jovial star reign'd at his birth, and in</LINE>
<LINE>Our temple was he married. Rise, and fade.</LINE>
<LINE>He shall be lord of lady Imogen,</LINE>
<LINE>And happier much by his affliction made.</LINE>
<LINE>This tablet lay upon his breast, wherein</LINE>
<LINE>Our pleasure his full fortune doth confine:</LINE>
<LINE>and so, away: no further with your din</LINE>
<LINE>Express impatience, lest you stir up mine.</LINE>
<LINE>Mount, eagle, to my palace crystalline.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Ascends</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Sicilius Leonatus</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He came in thunder; his celestial breath</LINE>
<LINE>Was sulphurous to smell: the holy eagle</LINE>
<LINE>Stoop'd as to foot us: his ascension is</LINE>
<LINE>More sweet than our blest fields: his royal bird</LINE>
<LINE>Prunes the immortal wing and cloys his beak,</LINE>
<LINE>As when his god is pleased.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>All</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thanks, Jupiter!</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>The Apparitions vanish</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Posthumus Leonatus</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Waking</STAGEDIR>  Sleep, thou hast been a grandsire, and begot</LINE>
<LINE>A father to me; and thou hast created</LINE>
<LINE>A mother and two brothers: but, O scorn!</LINE>
<LINE>Gone! they went hence so soon as they were born:</LINE>
<LINE>And so I am awake. Poor wretches that depend</LINE>
<LINE>On greatness' favour dream as I have done,</LINE>
<LINE>Wake and find nothing. But, alas, I swerve:</LINE>
<LINE>Many dream not to find, neither deserve,</LINE>
<LINE>And yet are steep'd in favours: so am I,</LINE>
<LINE>That have this golden chance and know not why.</LINE>
<LINE>What fairies haunt this ground? A book? O rare one!</LINE>
<LINE>Be not, as is our fangled world, a garment</LINE>
<LINE>Nobler than that it covers: let thy effects</LINE>
<LINE>So follow, to be most unlike our courtiers,</LINE>
<LINE>As good as promise.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Reads</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>'When as a lion's whelp shall, to himself unknown,</LINE>
<LINE>without seeking find, and be embraced by a piece of</LINE>
<LINE>tender air; and when from a stately cedar shall be</LINE>
<LINE>lopped branches, which, being dead many years,</LINE>
<LINE>shall after revive, be jointed to the old stock and</LINE>
<LINE>freshly grow; then shall Posthumus end his miseries,</LINE>
<LINE>Britain be fortunate and flourish in peace and plenty.'</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis still a dream, or else such stuff as madmen</LINE>
<LINE>Tongue and brain not; either both or nothing;</LINE>
<LINE>Or senseless speaking or a speaking such</LINE>
<LINE>As sense cannot untie. Be what it is,</LINE>
<LINE>The action of my life is like it, which</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Re-enter First Gaoler</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Gaoler</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, sir, are you ready for death?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Over-roasted rather; ready long ago.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Gaoler</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hanging is the word, sir: if</LINE>
<LINE>you be ready for that, you are well cooked.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So, if I prove a good repast to the</LINE>
<LINE>spectators, the dish pays the shot.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Gaoler</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A heavy reckoning for you, sir. But the comfort is,</LINE>
<LINE>you shall be called to no more payments, fear no</LINE>
<LINE>more tavern-bills; which are often the sadness of</LINE>
<LINE>parting, as the procuring of mirth: you come in</LINE>
<LINE>flint for want of meat, depart reeling with too</LINE>
<LINE>much drink; sorry that you have paid too much, and</LINE>
<LINE>sorry that you are paid too much; purse and brain</LINE>
<LINE>both empty; the brain the heavier for being too</LINE>
<LINE>light, the purse too light, being drawn of</LINE>
<LINE>heaviness: of this contradiction you shall now be</LINE>
<LINE>quit. O, the charity of a penny cord! It sums up</LINE>
<LINE>thousands in a trice: you have no true debitor and</LINE>
<LINE>creditor but it; of what's past, is, and to come,</LINE>
<LINE>the discharge: your neck, sir, is pen, book and</LINE>
<LINE>counters; so the acquittance follows.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am merrier to die than thou art to live.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Gaoler</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Indeed, sir, he that sleeps feels not the</LINE>
<LINE>tooth-ache: but a man that were to sleep your</LINE>
<LINE>sleep, and a hangman to help him to bed, I think he</LINE>
<LINE>would change places with his officer; for, look you,</LINE>
<LINE>sir, you know not which way you shall go.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, indeed do I, fellow.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Gaoler</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your death has eyes in 's head then; I have not seen</LINE>
<LINE>him so pictured: you must either be directed by</LINE>
<LINE>some that take upon them to know, or do take upon</LINE>
<LINE>yourself that which I am sure you do not know, or</LINE>
<LINE>jump the after inquiry on your own peril: and how</LINE>
<LINE>you shall speed in your journey's end, I think you'll</LINE>
<LINE>never return to tell one.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I tell thee, fellow, there are none want eyes to</LINE>
<LINE>direct them the way I am going, but such as wink and</LINE>
<LINE>will not use them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Gaoler</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What an infinite mock is this, that a man should</LINE>
<LINE>have the best use of eyes to see the way of</LINE>
<LINE>blindness! I am sure hanging's the way of winking.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter a Messenger</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Knock off his manacles; bring your prisoner to the king.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou bring'st good news; I am called to be made free.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Gaoler</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll be hang'd then.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou shalt be then freer than a gaoler; no bolts for the dead.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt POSTHUMUS LEONATUS and Messenger</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Gaoler</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Unless a man would marry a gallows and beget young</LINE>
<LINE>gibbets, I never saw one so prone. Yet, on my</LINE>
<LINE>conscience, there are verier knaves desire to live,</LINE>
<LINE>for all he be a Roman: and there be some of them</LINE>
<LINE>too that die against their wills; so should I, if I</LINE>
<LINE>were one. I would we were all of one mind, and one</LINE>
<LINE>mind good; O, there were desolation of gaolers and</LINE>
<LINE>gallowses! I speak against my present profit, but</LINE>
<LINE>my wish hath a preferment in 't.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt</STAGEDIR>
</SCENE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE V.  Cymbeline's tent.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter CYMBELINE, BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, ARVIRAGUS,
PISANIO, Lords, Officers, and Attendants</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Stand by my side, you whom the gods have made</LINE>
<LINE>Preservers of my throne. Woe is my heart</LINE>
<LINE>That the poor soldier that so richly fought,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose rags shamed gilded arms, whose naked breast</LINE>
<LINE>Stepp'd before larges of proof, cannot be found:</LINE>
<LINE>He shall be happy that can find him, if</LINE>
<LINE>Our grace can make him so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BELARIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I never saw</LINE>
<LINE>Such noble fury in so poor a thing;</LINE>
<LINE>Such precious deeds in one that promises nought</LINE>
<LINE>But beggary and poor looks.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No tidings of him?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PISANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He hath been search'd among the dead and living,</LINE>
<LINE>But no trace of him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To my grief, I am</LINE>
<LINE>The heir of his reward;</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>To BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>which I will add</LINE>
<LINE>To you, the liver, heart and brain of Britain,</LINE>
<LINE>By whom I grant she lives. 'Tis now the time</LINE>
<LINE>To ask of whence you are. Report it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BELARIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir,</LINE>
<LINE>In Cambria are we born, and gentlemen:</LINE>
<LINE>Further to boast were neither true nor modest,</LINE>
<LINE>Unless I add, we are honest.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Bow your knees.</LINE>
<LINE>Arise my knights o' the battle: I create you</LINE>
<LINE>Companions to our person and will fit you</LINE>
<LINE>With dignities becoming your estates.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter CORNELIUS and Ladies</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>There's business in these faces. Why so sadly</LINE>
<LINE>Greet you our victory? you look like Romans,</LINE>
<LINE>And not o' the court of Britain.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORNELIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hail, great king!</LINE>
<LINE>To sour your happiness, I must report</LINE>
<LINE>The queen is dead.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who worse than a physician</LINE>
<LINE>Would this report become? But I consider,</LINE>
<LINE>By medicine life may be prolong'd, yet death</LINE>
<LINE>Will seize the doctor too. How ended she?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORNELIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With horror, madly dying, like her life,</LINE>
<LINE>Which, being cruel to the world, concluded</LINE>
<LINE>Most cruel to herself. What she confess'd</LINE>
<LINE>I will report, so please you: these her women</LINE>
<LINE>Can trip me, if I err; who with wet cheeks</LINE>
<LINE>Were present when she finish'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Prithee, say.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORNELIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>First, she confess'd she never loved you, only</LINE>
<LINE>Affected greatness got by you, not you:</LINE>
<LINE>Married your royalty, was wife to your place;</LINE>
<LINE>Abhorr'd your person.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She alone knew this;</LINE>
<LINE>And, but she spoke it dying, I would not</LINE>
<LINE>Believe her lips in opening it. Proceed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORNELIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your daughter, whom she bore in hand to love</LINE>
<LINE>With such integrity, she did confess</LINE>
<LINE>Was as a scorpion to her sight; whose life,</LINE>
<LINE>But that her flight prevented it, she had</LINE>
<LINE>Ta'en off by poison.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O most delicate fiend!</LINE>
<LINE>Who is 't can read a woman? Is there more?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORNELIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>More, sir, and worse. She did confess she had</LINE>
<LINE>For you a mortal mineral; which, being took,</LINE>
<LINE>Should by the minute feed on life and lingering</LINE>
<LINE>By inches waste you: in which time she purposed,</LINE>
<LINE>By watching, weeping, tendance, kissing, to</LINE>
<LINE>O'ercome you with her show, and in time,</LINE>
<LINE>When she had fitted you with her craft, to work</LINE>
<LINE>Her son into the adoption of the crown:</LINE>
<LINE>But, failing of her end by his strange absence,</LINE>
<LINE>Grew shameless-desperate; open'd, in despite</LINE>
<LINE>Of heaven and men, her purposes; repented</LINE>
<LINE>The evils she hatch'd were not effected; so</LINE>
<LINE>Despairing died.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Heard you all this, her women?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Lady</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We did, so please your highness.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Mine eyes</LINE>
<LINE>Were not in fault, for she was beautiful;</LINE>
<LINE>Mine ears, that heard her flattery; nor my heart,</LINE>
<LINE>That thought her like her seeming; it had</LINE>
<LINE>been vicious</LINE>
<LINE>To have mistrusted her: yet, O my daughter!</LINE>
<LINE>That it was folly in me, thou mayst say,</LINE>
<LINE>And prove it in thy feeling. Heaven mend all!</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter LUCIUS, IACHIMO, the Soothsayer, and other
Roman Prisoners, guarded; POSTHUMUS LEONATUS
behind, and IMOGEN</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Thou comest not, Caius, now for tribute that</LINE>
<LINE>The Britons have razed out, though with the loss</LINE>
<LINE>Of many a bold one; whose kinsmen have made suit</LINE>
<LINE>That their good souls may be appeased with slaughter</LINE>
<LINE>Of you their captives, which ourself have granted:</LINE>
<LINE>So think of your estate.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAIUS LUCIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Consider, sir, the chance of war: the day</LINE>
<LINE>Was yours by accident; had it gone with us,</LINE>
<LINE>We should not, when the blood was cool,</LINE>
<LINE>have threaten'd</LINE>
<LINE>Our prisoners with the sword. But since the gods</LINE>
<LINE>Will have it thus, that nothing but our lives</LINE>
<LINE>May be call'd ransom, let it come: sufficeth</LINE>
<LINE>A Roman with a Roman's heart can suffer:</LINE>
<LINE>Augustus lives to think on't: and so much</LINE>
<LINE>For my peculiar care. This one thing only</LINE>
<LINE>I will entreat; my boy, a Briton born,</LINE>
<LINE>Let him be ransom'd: never master had</LINE>
<LINE>A page so kind, so duteous, diligent,</LINE>
<LINE>So tender over his occasions, true,</LINE>
<LINE>So feat, so nurse-like: let his virtue join</LINE>
<LINE>With my request, which I make bold your highness</LINE>
<LINE>Cannot deny; he hath done no Briton harm,</LINE>
<LINE>Though he have served a Roman: save him, sir,</LINE>
<LINE>And spare no blood beside.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have surely seen him:</LINE>
<LINE>His favour is familiar to me. Boy,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou hast look'd thyself into my grace,</LINE>
<LINE>And art mine own. I know not why, wherefore,</LINE>
<LINE>To say 'live, boy:' ne'er thank thy master; live:</LINE>
<LINE>And ask of Cymbeline what boon thou wilt,</LINE>
<LINE>Fitting my bounty and thy state, I'll give it;</LINE>
<LINE>Yea, though thou do demand a prisoner,</LINE>
<LINE>The noblest ta'en.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I humbly thank your highness.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAIUS LUCIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do not bid thee beg my life, good lad;</LINE>
<LINE>And yet I know thou wilt.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, no: alack,</LINE>
<LINE>There's other work in hand: I see a thing</LINE>
<LINE>Bitter to me as death: your life, good master,</LINE>
<LINE>Must shuffle for itself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAIUS LUCIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The boy disdains me,</LINE>
<LINE>He leaves me, scorns me: briefly die their joys</LINE>
<LINE>That place them on the truth of girls and boys.</LINE>
<LINE>Why stands he so perplex'd?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What wouldst thou, boy?</LINE>
<LINE>I love thee more and more: think more and more</LINE>
<LINE>What's best to ask. Know'st him thou look'st on? speak,</LINE>
<LINE>Wilt have him live? Is he thy kin? thy friend?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He is a Roman; no more kin to me</LINE>
<LINE>Than I to your highness; who, being born your vassal,</LINE>
<LINE>Am something nearer.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Wherefore eyest him so?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll tell you, sir, in private, if you please</LINE>
<LINE>To give me hearing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, with all my heart,</LINE>
<LINE>And lend my best attention. What's thy name?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fidele, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou'rt my good youth, my page;</LINE>
<LINE>I'll be thy master: walk with me; speak freely.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>CYMBELINE and IMOGEN converse apart</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BELARIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is not this boy revived from death?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARVIRAGUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>One sand another</LINE>
<LINE>Not more resembles that sweet rosy lad</LINE>
<LINE>Who died, and was Fidele. What think you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUIDERIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The same dead thing alive.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BELARIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Peace, peace! see further; he eyes us not; forbear;</LINE>
<LINE>Creatures may be alike: were 't he, I am sure</LINE>
<LINE>He would have spoke to us.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUIDERIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But we saw him dead.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BELARIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Be silent; let's see further.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PISANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR> It is my mistress:</LINE>
<LINE>Since she is living, let the time run on</LINE>
<LINE>To good or bad.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>CYMBELINE and IMOGEN come forward</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, stand thou by our side;</LINE>
<LINE>Make thy demand aloud.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>To IACHIMO</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Sir, step you forth;</LINE>
<LINE>Give answer to this boy, and do it freely;</LINE>
<LINE>Or, by our greatness and the grace of it,</LINE>
<LINE>Which is our honour, bitter torture shall</LINE>
<LINE>Winnow the truth from falsehood. On, speak to him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My boon is, that this gentleman may render</LINE>
<LINE>Of whom he had this ring.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>                 What's that to him?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That diamond upon your finger, say</LINE>
<LINE>How came it yours?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IACHIMO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou'lt torture me to leave unspoken that</LINE>
<LINE>Which, to be spoke, would torture thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How! me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IACHIMO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am glad to be constrain'd to utter that</LINE>
<LINE>Which torments me to conceal. By villany</LINE>
<LINE>I got this ring: 'twas Leonatus' jewel;</LINE>
<LINE>Whom thou didst banish; and--which more may</LINE>
<LINE>grieve thee,</LINE>
<LINE>As it doth me--a nobler sir ne'er lived</LINE>
<LINE>'Twixt sky and ground. Wilt thou hear more, my lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>All that belongs to this.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IACHIMO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That paragon, thy daughter,--</LINE>
<LINE>For whom my heart drops blood, and my false spirits</LINE>
<LINE>Quail to remember--Give me leave; I faint.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My daughter! what of her? Renew thy strength:</LINE>
<LINE>I had rather thou shouldst live while nature will</LINE>
<LINE>Than die ere I hear more: strive, man, and speak.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IACHIMO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Upon a time,--unhappy was the clock</LINE>
<LINE>That struck the hour!--it was in Rome,--accursed</LINE>
<LINE>The mansion where!--'twas at a feast,--O, would</LINE>
<LINE>Our viands had been poison'd, or at least</LINE>
<LINE>Those which I heaved to head!--the good Posthumus--</LINE>
<LINE>What should I say? he was too good to be</LINE>
<LINE>Where ill men were; and was the best of all</LINE>
<LINE>Amongst the rarest of good ones,--sitting sadly,</LINE>
<LINE>Hearing us praise our loves of Italy</LINE>
<LINE>For beauty that made barren the swell'd boast</LINE>
<LINE>Of him that best could speak, for feature, laming</LINE>
<LINE>The shrine of Venus, or straight-pight Minerva.</LINE>
<LINE>Postures beyond brief nature, for condition,</LINE>
<LINE>A shop of all the qualities that man</LINE>
<LINE>Loves woman for, besides that hook of wiving,</LINE>
<LINE>Fairness which strikes the eye--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I stand on fire:</LINE>
<LINE>Come to the matter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IACHIMO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>All too soon I shall,</LINE>
<LINE>Unless thou wouldst grieve quickly. This Posthumus,</LINE>
<LINE>Most like a noble lord in love and one</LINE>
<LINE>That had a royal lover, took his hint;</LINE>
<LINE>And, not dispraising whom we praised,--therein</LINE>
<LINE>He was as calm as virtue--he began</LINE>
<LINE>His mistress' picture; which by his tongue</LINE>
<LINE>being made,</LINE>
<LINE>And then a mind put in't, either our brags</LINE>
<LINE>Were crack'd of kitchen-trolls, or his description</LINE>
<LINE>Proved us unspeaking sots.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, nay, to the purpose.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IACHIMO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your daughter's chastity--there it begins.</LINE>
<LINE>He spake of her, as Dian had hot dreams,</LINE>
<LINE>And she alone were cold: whereat I, wretch,</LINE>
<LINE>Made scruple of his praise; and wager'd with him</LINE>
<LINE>Pieces of gold 'gainst this which then he wore</LINE>
<LINE>Upon his honour'd finger, to attain</LINE>
<LINE>In suit the place of's bed and win this ring</LINE>
<LINE>By hers and mine adultery. He, true knight,</LINE>
<LINE>No lesser of her honour confident</LINE>
<LINE>Than I did truly find her, stakes this ring;</LINE>
<LINE>And would so, had it been a carbuncle</LINE>
<LINE>Of Phoebus' wheel, and might so safely, had it</LINE>
<LINE>Been all the worth of's car. Away to Britain</LINE>
<LINE>Post I in this design: well may you, sir,</LINE>
<LINE>Remember me at court; where I was taught</LINE>
<LINE>Of your chaste daughter the wide difference</LINE>
<LINE>'Twixt amorous and villanous. Being thus quench'd</LINE>
<LINE>Of hope, not longing, mine Italian brain</LINE>
<LINE>'Gan in your duller Britain operate</LINE>
<LINE>Most vilely; for my vantage, excellent:</LINE>
<LINE>And, to be brief, my practise so prevail'd,</LINE>
<LINE>That I return'd with simular proof enough</LINE>
<LINE>To make the noble Leonatus mad,</LINE>
<LINE>By wounding his belief in her renown</LINE>
<LINE>With tokens thus, and thus; averting notes</LINE>
<LINE>Of chamber-hanging, pictures, this her bracelet,--</LINE>
<LINE>O cunning, how I got it!--nay, some marks</LINE>
<LINE>Of secret on her person, that he could not</LINE>
<LINE>But think her bond of chastity quite crack'd,</LINE>
<LINE>I having ta'en the forfeit. Whereupon--</LINE>
<LINE>Methinks, I see him now--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Advancing</STAGEDIR>             Ay, so thou dost,</LINE>
<LINE>Italian fiend! Ay me, most credulous fool,</LINE>
<LINE>Egregious murderer, thief, any thing</LINE>
<LINE>That's due to all the villains past, in being,</LINE>
<LINE>To come! O, give me cord, or knife, or poison,</LINE>
<LINE>Some upright justicer! Thou, king, send out</LINE>
<LINE>For torturers ingenious: it is I</LINE>
<LINE>That all the abhorred things o' the earth amend</LINE>
<LINE>By being worse than they. I am Posthumus,</LINE>
<LINE>That kill'd thy daughter:--villain-like, I lie--</LINE>
<LINE>That caused a lesser villain than myself,</LINE>
<LINE>A sacrilegious thief, to do't: the temple</LINE>
<LINE>Of virtue was she; yea, and she herself.</LINE>
<LINE>Spit, and throw stones, cast mire upon me, set</LINE>
<LINE>The dogs o' the street to bay me: every villain</LINE>
<LINE>Be call'd Posthumus Leonitus; and</LINE>
<LINE>Be villany less than 'twas! O Imogen!</LINE>
<LINE>My queen, my life, my wife! O Imogen,</LINE>
<LINE>Imogen, Imogen!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Peace, my lord; hear, hear--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Shall's have a play of this? Thou scornful page,</LINE>
<LINE>There lie thy part.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Striking her: she falls</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PISANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, gentlemen, help!</LINE>
<LINE>Mine and your mistress! O, my lord Posthumus!</LINE>
<LINE>You ne'er kill'd Imogen til now. Help, help!</LINE>
<LINE>Mine honour'd lady!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Does the world go round?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How come these staggers on me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PISANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Wake, my mistress!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If this be so, the gods do mean to strike me</LINE>
<LINE>To death with mortal joy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PISANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How fares thy mistress?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, get thee from my sight;</LINE>
<LINE>Thou gavest me poison: dangerous fellow, hence!</LINE>
<LINE>Breathe not where princes are.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The tune of Imogen!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PISANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lady,</LINE>
<LINE>The gods throw stones of sulphur on me, if</LINE>
<LINE>That box I gave you was not thought by me</LINE>
<LINE>A precious thing: I had it from the queen.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>New matter still?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It poison'd me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORNELIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O gods!</LINE>
<LINE>I left out one thing which the queen confess'd.</LINE>
<LINE>Which must approve thee honest: 'If Pisanio</LINE>
<LINE>Have,' said she, 'given his mistress that confection</LINE>
<LINE>Which I gave him for cordial, she is served</LINE>
<LINE>As I would serve a rat.'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What's this, Comelius?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORNELIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The queen, sir, very oft importuned me</LINE>
<LINE>To temper poisons for her, still pretending</LINE>
<LINE>The satisfaction of her knowledge only</LINE>
<LINE>In killing creatures vile, as cats and dogs,</LINE>
<LINE>Of no esteem: I, dreading that her purpose</LINE>
<LINE>Was of more danger, did compound for her</LINE>
<LINE>A certain stuff, which, being ta'en, would cease</LINE>
<LINE>The present power of life, but in short time</LINE>
<LINE>All offices of nature should again</LINE>
<LINE>Do their due functions. Have you ta'en of it?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Most like I did, for I was dead.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BELARIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My boys,</LINE>
<LINE>There was our error.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUIDERIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is, sure, Fidele.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why did you throw your wedded lady from you?</LINE>
<LINE>Think that you are upon a rock; and now</LINE>
<LINE>Throw me again.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Embracing him</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hang there like a fruit, my soul,</LINE>
<LINE>Till the tree die!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How now, my flesh, my child!</LINE>
<LINE>What, makest thou me a dullard in this act?</LINE>
<LINE>Wilt thou not speak to me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Kneeling</STAGEDIR>               Your blessing, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BELARIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>To GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS</STAGEDIR>  Though you did love</LINE>
<LINE>this youth, I blame ye not:</LINE>
<LINE>You had a motive for't.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My tears that fall</LINE>
<LINE>Prove holy water on thee! Imogen,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy mother's dead.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am sorry for't, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, she was nought; and long of her it was</LINE>
<LINE>That we meet here so strangely: but her son</LINE>
<LINE>Is gone, we know not how nor where.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PISANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord,</LINE>
<LINE>Now fear is from me, I'll speak troth. Lord Cloten,</LINE>
<LINE>Upon my lady's missing, came to me</LINE>
<LINE>With his sword drawn; foam'd at the mouth, and swore,</LINE>
<LINE>If I discover'd not which way she was gone,</LINE>
<LINE>It was my instant death. By accident,</LINE>
<LINE>had a feigned letter of my master's</LINE>
<LINE>Then in my pocket; which directed him</LINE>
<LINE>To seek her on the mountains near to Milford;</LINE>
<LINE>Where, in a frenzy, in my master's garments,</LINE>
<LINE>Which he enforced from me, away he posts</LINE>
<LINE>With unchaste purpose and with oath to violate</LINE>
<LINE>My lady's honour: what became of him</LINE>
<LINE>I further know not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUIDERIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let me end the story:</LINE>
<LINE>I slew him there.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, the gods forfend!</LINE>
<LINE>I would not thy good deeds should from my lips</LINE>
<LINE>Pluck a bard sentence: prithee, valiant youth,</LINE>
<LINE>Deny't again.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUIDERIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have spoke it, and I did it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He was a prince.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUIDERIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A most incivil one: the wrongs he did me</LINE>
<LINE>Were nothing prince-like; for he did provoke me</LINE>
<LINE>With language that would make me spurn the sea,</LINE>
<LINE>If it could so roar to me: I cut off's head;</LINE>
<LINE>And am right glad he is not standing here</LINE>
<LINE>To tell this tale of mine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am sorry for thee:</LINE>
<LINE>By thine own tongue thou art condemn'd, and must</LINE>
<LINE>Endure our law: thou'rt dead.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That headless man</LINE>
<LINE>I thought had been my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Bind the offender,</LINE>
<LINE>And take him from our presence.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BELARIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Stay, sir king:</LINE>
<LINE>This man is better than the man he slew,</LINE>
<LINE>As well descended as thyself; and hath</LINE>
<LINE>More of thee merited than a band of Clotens</LINE>
<LINE>Had ever scar for.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>To the Guard</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Let his arms alone;</LINE>
<LINE>They were not born for bondage.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, old soldier,</LINE>
<LINE>Wilt thou undo the worth thou art unpaid for,</LINE>
<LINE>By tasting of our wrath? How of descent</LINE>
<LINE>As good as we?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARVIRAGUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In that he spake too far.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And thou shalt die for't.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BELARIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We will die all three:</LINE>
<LINE>But I will prove that two on's are as good</LINE>
<LINE>As I have given out him. My sons, I must,</LINE>
<LINE>For mine own part, unfold a dangerous speech,</LINE>
<LINE>Though, haply, well for you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARVIRAGUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your danger's ours.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUIDERIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And our good his.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BELARIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Have at it then, by leave.</LINE>
<LINE>Thou hadst, great king, a subject who</LINE>
<LINE>Was call'd Belarius.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What of him? he is</LINE>
<LINE>A banish'd traitor.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BELARIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He it is that hath</LINE>
<LINE>Assumed this age; indeed a banish'd man;</LINE>
<LINE>I know not how a traitor.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Take him hence:</LINE>
<LINE>The whole world shall not save him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BELARIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not too hot:</LINE>
<LINE>First pay me for the nursing of thy sons;</LINE>
<LINE>And let it be confiscate all, so soon</LINE>
<LINE>As I have received it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nursing of my sons!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BELARIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am too blunt and saucy: here's my knee:</LINE>
<LINE>Ere I arise, I will prefer my sons;</LINE>
<LINE>Then spare not the old father. Mighty sir,</LINE>
<LINE>These two young gentlemen, that call me father</LINE>
<LINE>And think they are my sons, are none of mine;</LINE>
<LINE>They are the issue of your loins, my liege,</LINE>
<LINE>And blood of your begetting.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How! my issue!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BELARIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So sure as you your father's. I, old Morgan,</LINE>
<LINE>Am that Belarius whom you sometime banish'd:</LINE>
<LINE>Your pleasure was my mere offence, my punishment</LINE>
<LINE>Itself, and all my treason; that I suffer'd</LINE>
<LINE>Was all the harm I did. These gentle princes--</LINE>
<LINE>For such and so they are--these twenty years</LINE>
<LINE>Have I train'd up: those arts they have as I</LINE>
<LINE>Could put into them; my breeding was, sir, as</LINE>
<LINE>Your highness knows. Their nurse, Euriphile,</LINE>
<LINE>Whom for the theft I wedded, stole these children</LINE>
<LINE>Upon my banishment: I moved her to't,</LINE>
<LINE>Having received the punishment before,</LINE>
<LINE>For that which I did then: beaten for loyalty</LINE>
<LINE>Excited me to treason: their dear loss,</LINE>
<LINE>The more of you 'twas felt, the more it shaped</LINE>
<LINE>Unto my end of stealing them. But, gracious sir,</LINE>
<LINE>Here are your sons again; and I must lose</LINE>
<LINE>Two of the sweet'st companions in the world.</LINE>
<LINE>The benediction of these covering heavens</LINE>
<LINE>Fall on their heads like dew! for they are worthy</LINE>
<LINE>To inlay heaven with stars.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou weep'st, and speak'st.</LINE>
<LINE>The service that you three have done is more</LINE>
<LINE>Unlike than this thou tell'st. I lost my children:</LINE>
<LINE>If these be they, I know not how to wish</LINE>
<LINE>A pair of worthier sons.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BELARIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Be pleased awhile.</LINE>
<LINE>This gentleman, whom I call Polydore,</LINE>
<LINE>Most worthy prince, as yours, is true Guiderius:</LINE>
<LINE>This gentleman, my Cadwal, Arviragus,</LINE>
<LINE>Your younger princely son; he, sir, was lapp'd</LINE>
<LINE>In a most curious mantle, wrought by the hand</LINE>
<LINE>Of his queen mother, which for more probation</LINE>
<LINE>I can with ease produce.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Guiderius had</LINE>
<LINE>Upon his neck a mole, a sanguine star;</LINE>
<LINE>It was a mark of wonder.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BELARIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is he;</LINE>
<LINE>Who hath upon him still that natural stamp:</LINE>
<LINE>It was wise nature's end in the donation,</LINE>
<LINE>To be his evidence now.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, what, am I</LINE>
<LINE>A mother to the birth of three? Ne'er mother</LINE>
<LINE>Rejoiced deliverance more. Blest pray you be,</LINE>
<LINE>That, after this strange starting from your orbs,</LINE>
<LINE>may reign in them now! O Imogen,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou hast lost by this a kingdom.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, my lord;</LINE>
<LINE>I have got two worlds by 't. O my gentle brothers,</LINE>
<LINE>Have we thus met? O, never say hereafter</LINE>
<LINE>But I am truest speaker you call'd me brother,</LINE>
<LINE>When I was but your sister; I you brothers,</LINE>
<LINE>When ye were so indeed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Did you e'er meet?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARVIRAGUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, my good lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GUIDERIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And at first meeting loved;</LINE>
<LINE>Continued so, until we thought he died.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORNELIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By the queen's dram she swallow'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O rare instinct!</LINE>
<LINE>When shall I hear all through? This fierce</LINE>
<LINE>abridgement</LINE>
<LINE>Hath to it circumstantial branches, which</LINE>
<LINE>Distinction should be rich in. Where? how lived You?</LINE>
<LINE>And when came you to serve our Roman captive?</LINE>
<LINE>How parted with your brothers? how first met them?</LINE>
<LINE>Why fled you from the court? and whither? These,</LINE>
<LINE>And your three motives to the battle, with</LINE>
<LINE>I know not how much more, should be demanded;</LINE>
<LINE>And all the other by-dependencies,</LINE>
<LINE>From chance to chance: but nor the time nor place</LINE>
<LINE>Will serve our long inter'gatories. See,</LINE>
<LINE>Posthumus anchors upon Imogen,</LINE>
<LINE>And she, like harmless lightning, throws her eye</LINE>
<LINE>On him, her brother, me, her master, hitting</LINE>
<LINE>Each object with a joy: the counterchange</LINE>
<LINE>Is severally in all. Let's quit this ground,</LINE>
<LINE>And smoke the temple with our sacrifices.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>To BELARIUS</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Thou art my brother; so we'll hold thee ever.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You are my father too, and did relieve me,</LINE>
<LINE>To see this gracious season.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>All o'erjoy'd,</LINE>
<LINE>Save these in bonds: let them be joyful too,</LINE>
<LINE>For they shall taste our comfort.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMOGEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My good master,</LINE>
<LINE>I will yet do you service.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAIUS LUCIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Happy be you!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The forlorn soldier, that so nobly fought,</LINE>
<LINE>He would have well becomed this place, and graced</LINE>
<LINE>The thankings of a king.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am, sir,</LINE>
<LINE>The soldier that did company these three</LINE>
<LINE>In poor beseeming; 'twas a fitment for</LINE>
<LINE>The purpose I then follow'd. That I was he,</LINE>
<LINE>Speak, Iachimo: I had you down and might</LINE>
<LINE>Have made you finish.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IACHIMO</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Kneeling</STAGEDIR>          I am down again:</LINE>
<LINE>But now my heavy conscience sinks my knee,</LINE>
<LINE>As then your force did. Take that life, beseech you,</LINE>
<LINE>Which I so often owe: but your ring first;</LINE>
<LINE>And here the bracelet of the truest princess</LINE>
<LINE>That ever swore her faith.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Kneel not to me:</LINE>
<LINE>The power that I have on you is, to spare you;</LINE>
<LINE>The malice towards you to forgive you: live,</LINE>
<LINE>And deal with others better.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nobly doom'd!</LINE>
<LINE>We'll learn our freeness of a son-in-law;</LINE>
<LINE>Pardon's the word to all.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARVIRAGUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You holp us, sir,</LINE>
<LINE>As you did mean indeed to be our brother;</LINE>
<LINE>Joy'd are we that you are.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your servant, princes. Good my lord of Rome,</LINE>
<LINE>Call forth your soothsayer: as I slept, methought</LINE>
<LINE>Great Jupiter, upon his eagle back'd,</LINE>
<LINE>Appear'd to me, with other spritely shows</LINE>
<LINE>Of mine own kindred: when I waked, I found</LINE>
<LINE>This label on my bosom; whose containing</LINE>
<LINE>Is so from sense in hardness, that I can</LINE>
<LINE>Make no collection of it: let him show</LINE>
<LINE>His skill in the construction.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>Soothsayer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The lofty cedar, royal Cymbeline,</LINE>
<LINE>Personates thee: and thy lopp'd branches point</LINE>
<LINE>Thy two sons forth; who, by Belarius stol'n,</LINE>
<LINE>For many years thought dead, are now revived,</LINE>
<LINE>To the majestic cedar join'd, whose issue</LINE>
<LINE>Promises Britain peace and plenty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well</LINE>
<LINE>My peace we will begin. And, Caius Lucius,</LINE>
<LINE>Although the victor, we submit to Caesar,</LINE>
<LINE>And to the Roman empire; promising</LINE>
<LINE>To pay our wonted tribute, from the which</LINE>
<LINE>We were dissuaded by our wicked queen;</LINE>
<LINE>Whom heavens, in justice, both on her and hers,</LINE>
<LINE>Have laid most heavy hand.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Soothsayer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The fingers of the powers above do tune</LINE>
<LINE>The harmony of this peace. The vision</LINE>
<LINE>Which I made known to Lucius, ere the stroke</LINE>
<LINE>Of this yet scarce-cold battle, at this instant</LINE>
<LINE>Is full accomplish'd; for the Roman eagle,</LINE>
<LINE>From south to west on wing soaring aloft,</LINE>
<LINE>Lessen'd herself, and in the beams o' the sun</LINE>
<LINE>So vanish'd: which foreshow'd our princely eagle,</LINE>
<LINE>The imperial Caesar, should again unite</LINE>
<LINE>His favour with the radiant Cymbeline,</LINE>
<LINE>Which shines here in the west.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYMBELINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Laud we the gods;</LINE>
<LINE>And let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils</LINE>
<LINE>From our blest altars. Publish we this peace</LINE>
<LINE>To all our subjects. Set we forward: let</LINE>
<LINE>A Roman and a British ensign wave</LINE>
<LINE>Friendly together: so through Lud's-town march:</LINE>
<LINE>And in the temple of great Jupiter</LINE>
<LINE>Our peace we'll ratify; seal it with feasts.</LINE>
<LINE>Set on there! Never was a war did cease,</LINE>
<LINE>Ere bloody hands were wash'd, with such a peace.</LINE>
