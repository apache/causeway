<STAGEDIR>Enter KING HENRY, LORD JOHN OF LANCASTER, the EARL
of WESTMORELAND, SIR WALTER BLUNT, and others</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY IV</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So shaken as we are, so wan with care,</LINE>
<LINE>Find we a time for frighted peace to pant,</LINE>
<LINE>And breathe short-winded accents of new broils</LINE>
<LINE>To be commenced in strands afar remote.</LINE>
<LINE>No more the thirsty entrance of this soil</LINE>
<LINE>Shall daub her lips with her own children's blood;</LINE>
<LINE>Nor more shall trenching war channel her fields,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor bruise her flowerets with the armed hoofs</LINE>
<LINE>Of hostile paces: those opposed eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>Which, like the meteors of a troubled heaven,</LINE>
<LINE>All of one nature, of one substance bred,</LINE>
<LINE>Did lately meet in the intestine shock</LINE>
<LINE>And furious close of civil butchery</LINE>
<LINE>Shall now, in mutual well-beseeming ranks,</LINE>
<LINE>March all one way and be no more opposed</LINE>
<LINE>Against acquaintance, kindred and allies:</LINE>
<LINE>The edge of war, like an ill-sheathed knife,</LINE>
<LINE>No more shall cut his master. Therefore, friends,</LINE>
<LINE>As far as to the sepulchre of Christ,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose soldier now, under whose blessed cross</LINE>
<LINE>We are impressed and engaged to fight,</LINE>
<LINE>Forthwith a power of English shall we levy;</LINE>
<LINE>Whose arms were moulded in their mothers' womb</LINE>
<LINE>To chase these pagans in those holy fields</LINE>
<LINE>Over whose acres walk'd those blessed feet</LINE>
<LINE>Which fourteen hundred years ago were nail'd</LINE>
<LINE>For our advantage on the bitter cross.</LINE>
<LINE>But this our purpose now is twelve month old,</LINE>
<LINE>And bootless 'tis to tell you we will go:</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore we meet not now. Then let me hear</LINE>
<LINE>Of you, my gentle cousin Westmoreland,</LINE>
<LINE>What yesternight our council did decree</LINE>
<LINE>In forwarding this dear expedience.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WESTMORELAND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My liege, this haste was hot in question,</LINE>
<LINE>And many limits of the charge set down</LINE>
<LINE>But yesternight: when all athwart there came</LINE>
<LINE>A post from Wales loaden with heavy news;</LINE>
<LINE>Whose worst was, that the noble Mortimer,</LINE>
<LINE>Leading the men of Herefordshire to fight</LINE>
<LINE>Against the irregular and wild Glendower,</LINE>
<LINE>Was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken,</LINE>
<LINE>A thousand of his people butchered;</LINE>
<LINE>Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse,</LINE>
<LINE>Such beastly shameless transformation,</LINE>
<LINE>By those Welshwomen done as may not be</LINE>
<LINE>Without much shame retold or spoken of.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY IV</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It seems then that the tidings of this broil</LINE>
<LINE>Brake off our business for the Holy Land.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WESTMORELAND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This match'd with other did, my gracious lord;</LINE>
<LINE>For more uneven and unwelcome news</LINE>
<LINE>Came from the north and thus it did import:</LINE>
<LINE>On Holy-rood day, the gallant Hotspur there,</LINE>
<LINE>Young Harry Percy and brave Archibald,</LINE>
<LINE>That ever-valiant and approved Scot,</LINE>
<LINE>At Holmedon met,</LINE>
<LINE>Where they did spend a sad and bloody hour,</LINE>
<LINE>As by discharge of their artillery,</LINE>
<LINE>And shape of likelihood, the news was told;</LINE>
<LINE>For he that brought them, in the very heat</LINE>
<LINE>And pride of their contention did take horse,</LINE>
<LINE>Uncertain of the issue any way.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY IV</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here is a dear, a true industrious friend,</LINE>
<LINE>Sir Walter Blunt, new lighted from his horse.</LINE>
<LINE>Stain'd with the variation of each soil</LINE>
<LINE>Betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours;</LINE>
<LINE>And he hath brought us smooth and welcome news.</LINE>
<LINE>The Earl of Douglas is discomfited:</LINE>
<LINE>Ten thousand bold Scots, two and twenty knights,</LINE>
<LINE>Balk'd in their own blood did Sir Walter see</LINE>
<LINE>On Holmedon's plains. Of prisoners, Hotspur took</LINE>
<LINE>Mordake the Earl of Fife, and eldest son</LINE>
<LINE>To beaten Douglas; and the Earl of Athol,</LINE>
<LINE>Of Murray, Angus, and Menteith:</LINE>
<LINE>And is not this an honourable spoil?</LINE>
<LINE>A gallant prize? ha, cousin, is it not?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WESTMORELAND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In faith,</LINE>
<LINE>It is a conquest for a prince to boast of.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY IV</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yea, there thou makest me sad and makest me sin</LINE>
<LINE>In envy that my Lord Northumberland</LINE>
<LINE>Should be the father to so blest a son,</LINE>
<LINE>A son who is the theme of honour's tongue;</LINE>
<LINE>Amongst a grove, the very straightest plant;</LINE>
<LINE>Who is sweet Fortune's minion and her pride:</LINE>
<LINE>Whilst I, by looking on the praise of him,</LINE>
<LINE>See riot and dishonour stain the brow</LINE>
<LINE>Of my young Harry. O that it could be proved</LINE>
<LINE>That some night-tripping fairy had exchanged</LINE>
<LINE>In cradle-clothes our children where they lay,</LINE>
<LINE>And call'd mine Percy, his Plantagenet!</LINE>
<LINE>Then would I have his Harry, and he mine.</LINE>
<LINE>But let him from my thoughts. What think you, coz,</LINE>
<LINE>Of this young Percy's pride? the prisoners,</LINE>
<LINE>Which he in this adventure hath surprised,</LINE>
<LINE>To his own use he keeps; and sends me word,</LINE>
<LINE>I shall have none but Mordake Earl of Fife.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WESTMORELAND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is his uncle's teaching; this is Worcester,</LINE>
<LINE>Malevolent to you in all aspects;</LINE>
<LINE>Which makes him prune himself, and bristle up</LINE>
<LINE>The crest of youth against your dignity.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY IV</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But I have sent for him to answer this;</LINE>
<LINE>And for this cause awhile we must neglect</LINE>
<LINE>Our holy purpose to Jerusalem.</LINE>
<LINE>Cousin, on Wednesday next our council we</LINE>
<LINE>Will hold at Windsor; so inform the lords:</LINE>
<LINE>But come yourself with speed to us again;</LINE>
<LINE>For more is to be said and to be done</LINE>
<LINE>Than out of anger can be uttered.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WESTMORELAND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will, my liege.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt</STAGEDIR>
</SCENE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE II.  London. An apartment of the Prince's.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter the PRINCE OF WALES and FALSTAFF</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, Hal, what time of day is it, lad?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou art so fat-witted, with drinking of old sack</LINE>
<LINE>and unbuttoning thee after supper and sleeping upon</LINE>
<LINE>benches after noon, that thou hast forgotten to</LINE>
<LINE>demand that truly which thou wouldst truly know.</LINE>
<LINE>What a devil hast thou to do with the time of the</LINE>
<LINE>day? Unless hours were cups of sack and minutes</LINE>
<LINE>capons and clocks the tongues of bawds and dials the</LINE>
<LINE>signs of leaping-houses and the blessed sun himself</LINE>
<LINE>a fair hot wench in flame-coloured taffeta, I see no</LINE>
<LINE>reason why thou shouldst be so superfluous to demand</LINE>
<LINE>the time of the day.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Indeed, you come near me now, Hal; for we that take</LINE>
<LINE>purses go by the moon and the seven stars, and not</LINE>
<LINE>by Phoebus, he,'that wandering knight so fair.' And,</LINE>
<LINE>I prithee, sweet wag, when thou art king, as, God</LINE>
<LINE>save thy grace,--majesty I should say, for grace</LINE>
<LINE>thou wilt have none,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, none?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, by my troth, not so much as will serve to</LINE>
<LINE>prologue to an egg and butter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, how then? come, roundly, roundly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, then, sweet wag, when thou art king, let not</LINE>
<LINE>us that are squires of the night's body be called</LINE>
<LINE>thieves of the day's beauty: let us be Diana's</LINE>
<LINE>foresters, gentlemen of the shade, minions of the</LINE>
<LINE>moon; and let men say we be men of good government,</LINE>
<LINE>being governed, as the sea is, by our noble and</LINE>
<LINE>chaste mistress the moon, under whose countenance we steal.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou sayest well, and it holds well too; for the</LINE>
<LINE>fortune of us that are the moon's men doth ebb and</LINE>
<LINE>flow like the sea, being governed, as the sea is,</LINE>
<LINE>by the moon. As, for proof, now: a purse of gold</LINE>
<LINE>most resolutely snatched on Monday night and most</LINE>
<LINE>dissolutely spent on Tuesday morning; got with</LINE>
<LINE>swearing 'Lay by' and spent with crying 'Bring in;'</LINE>
<LINE>now in as low an ebb as the foot of the ladder</LINE>
<LINE>and by and by in as high a flow as the ridge of the gallows.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By the Lord, thou sayest true, lad. And is not my</LINE>
<LINE>hostess of the tavern a most sweet wench?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As the honey of Hybla, my old lad of the castle. And</LINE>
<LINE>is not a buff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How now, how now, mad wag! what, in thy quips and</LINE>
<LINE>thy quiddities? what a plague have I to do with a</LINE>
<LINE>buff jerkin?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, what a pox have I to do with my hostess of the tavern?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, thou hast called her to a reckoning many a</LINE>
<LINE>time and oft.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Did I ever call for thee to pay thy part?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No; I'll give thee thy due, thou hast paid all there.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yea, and elsewhere, so far as my coin would stretch;</LINE>
<LINE>and where it would not, I have used my credit.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yea, and so used it that were it not here apparent</LINE>
<LINE>that thou art heir apparent--But, I prithee, sweet</LINE>
<LINE>wag, shall there be gallows standing in England when</LINE>
<LINE>thou art king? and resolution thus fobbed as it is</LINE>
<LINE>with the rusty curb of old father antic the law? Do</LINE>
<LINE>not thou, when thou art king, hang a thief.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No; thou shalt.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Shall I? O rare! By the Lord, I'll be a brave judge.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou judgest false already: I mean, thou shalt have</LINE>
<LINE>the hanging of the thieves and so become a rare hangman.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, Hal, well; and in some sort it jumps with my</LINE>
<LINE>humour as well as waiting in the court, I can tell</LINE>
<LINE>you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For obtaining of suits?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yea, for obtaining of suits, whereof the hangman</LINE>
<LINE>hath no lean wardrobe. 'Sblood, I am as melancholy</LINE>
<LINE>as a gib cat or a lugged bear.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Or an old lion, or a lover's lute.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yea, or the drone of a Lincolnshire bagpipe.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What sayest thou to a hare, or the melancholy of</LINE>
<LINE>Moor-ditch?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou hast the most unsavoury similes and art indeed</LINE>
<LINE>the most comparative, rascalliest, sweet young</LINE>
<LINE>prince. But, Hal, I prithee, trouble me no more</LINE>
<LINE>with vanity. I would to God thou and I knew where a</LINE>
<LINE>commodity of good names were to be bought. An old</LINE>
<LINE>lord of the council rated me the other day in the</LINE>
<LINE>street about you, sir, but I marked him not; and yet</LINE>
<LINE>he talked very wisely, but I regarded him not; and</LINE>
<LINE>yet he talked wisely, and in the street too.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou didst well; for wisdom cries out in the</LINE>
<LINE>streets, and no man regards it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, thou hast damnable iteration and art indeed able</LINE>
<LINE>to corrupt a saint. Thou hast done much harm upon</LINE>
<LINE>me, Hal; God forgive thee for it! Before I knew</LINE>
<LINE>thee, Hal, I knew nothing; and now am I, if a man</LINE>
<LINE>should speak truly, little better than one of the</LINE>
<LINE>wicked. I must give over this life, and I will give</LINE>
<LINE>it over: by the Lord, and I do not, I am a villain:</LINE>
<LINE>I'll be damned for never a king's son in</LINE>
<LINE>Christendom.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where shall we take a purse tomorrow, Jack?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Zounds, where thou wilt, lad; I'll make one; an I</LINE>
<LINE>do not, call me villain and baffle me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I see a good amendment of life in thee; from praying</LINE>
<LINE>to purse-taking.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, Hal, 'tis my vocation, Hal; 'tis no sin for a</LINE>
<LINE>man to labour in his vocation.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter POINS</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Poins! Now shall we know if Gadshill have set a</LINE>
<LINE>match. O, if men were to be saved by merit, what</LINE>
<LINE>hole in hell were hot enough for him? This is the</LINE>
<LINE>most omnipotent villain that ever cried 'Stand' to</LINE>
<LINE>a true man.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good morrow, Ned.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POINS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good morrow, sweet Hal. What says Monsieur Remorse?</LINE>
<LINE>what says Sir John Sack and Sugar? Jack! how</LINE>
<LINE>agrees the devil and thee about thy soul, that thou</LINE>
<LINE>soldest him on Good-Friday last for a cup of Madeira</LINE>
<LINE>and a cold capon's leg?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir John stands to his word, the devil shall have</LINE>
<LINE>his bargain; for he was never yet a breaker of</LINE>
<LINE>proverbs: he will give the devil his due.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POINS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then art thou damned for keeping thy word with the devil.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Else he had been damned for cozening the devil.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POINS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But, my lads, my lads, to-morrow morning, by four</LINE>
<LINE>o'clock, early at Gadshill! there are pilgrims going</LINE>
<LINE>to Canterbury with rich offerings, and traders</LINE>
<LINE>riding to London with fat purses: I have vizards</LINE>
<LINE>for you all; you have horses for yourselves:</LINE>
<LINE>Gadshill lies to-night in Rochester: I have bespoke</LINE>
<LINE>supper to-morrow night in Eastcheap: we may do it</LINE>
<LINE>as secure as sleep. If you will go, I will stuff</LINE>
<LINE>your purses full of crowns; if you will not, tarry</LINE>
<LINE>at home and be hanged.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hear ye, Yedward; if I tarry at home and go not,</LINE>
<LINE>I'll hang you for going.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POINS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You will, chops?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hal, wilt thou make one?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who, I rob? I a thief? not I, by my faith.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There's neither honesty, manhood, nor good</LINE>
<LINE>fellowship in thee, nor thou camest not of the blood</LINE>
<LINE>royal, if thou darest not stand for ten shillings.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well then, once in my days I'll be a madcap.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, that's well said.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, come what will, I'll tarry at home.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By the Lord, I'll be a traitor then, when thou art king.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I care not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POINS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir John, I prithee, leave the prince and me alone:</LINE>
<LINE>I will lay him down such reasons for this adventure</LINE>
<LINE>that he shall go.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, God give thee the spirit of persuasion and him</LINE>
<LINE>the ears of profiting, that what thou speakest may</LINE>
<LINE>move and what he hears may be believed, that the</LINE>
<LINE>true prince may, for recreation sake, prove a false</LINE>
<LINE>thief; for the poor abuses of the time want</LINE>
<LINE>countenance. Farewell: you shall find me in Eastcheap.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Farewell, thou latter spring! farewell, All-hallown summer!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit Falstaff</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POINS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, my good sweet honey lord, ride with us</LINE>
<LINE>to-morrow: I have a jest to execute that I cannot</LINE>
<LINE>manage alone. Falstaff, Bardolph, Peto and Gadshill</LINE>
<LINE>shall rob those men that we have already waylaid:</LINE>
<LINE>yourself and I will not be there; and when they</LINE>
<LINE>have the booty, if you and I do not rob them, cut</LINE>
<LINE>this head off from my shoulders.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How shall we part with them in setting forth?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POINS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, we will set forth before or after them, and</LINE>
<LINE>appoint them a place of meeting, wherein it is at</LINE>
<LINE>our pleasure to fail, and then will they adventure</LINE>
<LINE>upon the exploit themselves; which they shall have</LINE>
<LINE>no sooner achieved, but we'll set upon them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yea, but 'tis like that they will know us by our</LINE>
<LINE>horses, by our habits and by every other</LINE>
<LINE>appointment, to be ourselves.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POINS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tut! our horses they shall not see: I'll tie them</LINE>
<LINE>in the wood; our vizards we will change after we</LINE>
<LINE>leave them: and, sirrah, I have cases of buckram</LINE>
<LINE>for the nonce, to immask our noted outward garments.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yea, but I doubt they will be too hard for us.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POINS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, for two of them, I know them to be as</LINE>
<LINE>true-bred cowards as ever turned back; and for the</LINE>
<LINE>third, if he fight longer than he sees reason, I'll</LINE>
<LINE>forswear arms. The virtue of this jest will be, the</LINE>
<LINE>incomprehensible lies that this same fat rogue will</LINE>
<LINE>tell us when we meet at supper: how thirty, at</LINE>
<LINE>least, he fought with; what wards, what blows, what</LINE>
<LINE>extremities he endured; and in the reproof of this</LINE>
<LINE>lies the jest.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, I'll go with thee: provide us all things</LINE>
<LINE>necessary and meet me to-morrow night in Eastcheap;</LINE>
<LINE>there I'll sup. Farewell.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POINS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Farewell, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit Poins</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know you all, and will awhile uphold</LINE>
<LINE>The unyoked humour of your idleness:</LINE>
<LINE>Yet herein will I imitate the sun,</LINE>
<LINE>Who doth permit the base contagious clouds</LINE>
<LINE>To smother up his beauty from the world,</LINE>
<LINE>That, when he please again to be himself,</LINE>
<LINE>Being wanted, he may be more wonder'd at,</LINE>
<LINE>By breaking through the foul and ugly mists</LINE>
<LINE>Of vapours that did seem to strangle him.</LINE>
<LINE>If all the year were playing holidays,</LINE>
<LINE>To sport would be as tedious as to work;</LINE>
<LINE>But when they seldom come, they wish'd for come,</LINE>
<LINE>And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents.</LINE>
<LINE>So, when this loose behavior I throw off</LINE>
<LINE>And pay the debt I never promised,</LINE>
<LINE>By how much better than my word I am,</LINE>
<LINE>By so much shall I falsify men's hopes;</LINE>
<LINE>And like bright metal on a sullen ground,</LINE>
<LINE>My reformation, glittering o'er my fault,</LINE>
<LINE>Shall show more goodly and attract more eyes</LINE>
<LINE>Than that which hath no foil to set it off.</LINE>
<LINE>I'll so offend, to make offence a skill;</LINE>
<LINE>Redeeming time when men think least I will.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter the KING, NORTHUMBERLAND, WORCESTER, HOTSPUR,
SIR WALTER BLUNT, with others</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY IV</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My blood hath been too cold and temperate,</LINE>
<LINE>Unapt to stir at these indignities,</LINE>
<LINE>And you have found me; for accordingly</LINE>
<LINE>You tread upon my patience: but be sure</LINE>
<LINE>I will from henceforth rather be myself,</LINE>
<LINE>Mighty and to be fear'd, than my condition;</LINE>
<LINE>Which hath been smooth as oil, soft as young down,</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore lost that title of respect</LINE>
<LINE>Which the proud soul ne'er pays but to the proud.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EARL OF WORCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Our house, my sovereign liege, little deserves</LINE>
<LINE>The scourge of greatness to be used on it;</LINE>
<LINE>And that same greatness too which our own hands</LINE>
<LINE>Have holp to make so portly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NORTHUMBERLAND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord.--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY IV</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Worcester, get thee gone; for I do see</LINE>
<LINE>Danger and disobedience in thine eye:</LINE>
<LINE>O, sir, your presence is too bold and peremptory,</LINE>
<LINE>And majesty might never yet endure</LINE>
<LINE>The moody frontier of a servant brow.</LINE>
<LINE>You have good leave to leave us: when we need</LINE>
<LINE>Your use and counsel, we shall send for you.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit Worcester</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>You were about to speak.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>To North</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NORTHUMBERLAND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yea, my good lord.</LINE>
<LINE>Those prisoners in your highness' name demanded,</LINE>
<LINE>Which Harry Percy here at Holmedon took,</LINE>
<LINE>Were, as he says, not with such strength denied</LINE>
<LINE>As is deliver'd to your majesty:</LINE>
<LINE>Either envy, therefore, or misprison</LINE>
<LINE>Is guilty of this fault and not my son.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My liege, I did deny no prisoners.</LINE>
<LINE>But I remember, when the fight was done,</LINE>
<LINE>When I was dry with rage and extreme toil,</LINE>
<LINE>Breathless and faint, leaning upon my sword,</LINE>
<LINE>Came there a certain lord, neat, and trimly dress'd,</LINE>
<LINE>Fresh as a bridegroom; and his chin new reap'd</LINE>
<LINE>Show'd like a stubble-land at harvest-home;</LINE>
<LINE>He was perfumed like a milliner;</LINE>
<LINE>And 'twixt his finger and his thumb he held</LINE>
<LINE>A pouncet-box, which ever and anon</LINE>
<LINE>He gave his nose and took't away again;</LINE>
<LINE>Who therewith angry, when it next came there,</LINE>
<LINE>Took it in snuff; and still he smiled and talk'd,</LINE>
<LINE>And as the soldiers bore dead bodies by,</LINE>
<LINE>He call'd them untaught knaves, unmannerly,</LINE>
<LINE>To bring a slovenly unhandsome corse</LINE>
<LINE>Betwixt the wind and his nobility.</LINE>
<LINE>With many holiday and lady terms</LINE>
<LINE>He question'd me; amongst the rest, demanded</LINE>
<LINE>My prisoners in your majesty's behalf.</LINE>
<LINE>I then, all smarting with my wounds being cold,</LINE>
<LINE>To be so pester'd with a popinjay,</LINE>
<LINE>Out of my grief and my impatience,</LINE>
<LINE>Answer'd neglectingly I know not what,</LINE>
<LINE>He should or he should not; for he made me mad</LINE>
<LINE>To see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet</LINE>
<LINE>And talk so like a waiting-gentlewoman</LINE>
<LINE>Of guns and drums and wounds,--God save the mark!--</LINE>
<LINE>And telling me the sovereign'st thing on earth</LINE>
<LINE>Was parmaceti for an inward bruise;</LINE>
<LINE>And that it was great pity, so it was,</LINE>
<LINE>This villanous salt-petre should be digg'd</LINE>
<LINE>Out of the bowels of the harmless earth,</LINE>
<LINE>Which many a good tall fellow had destroy'd</LINE>
<LINE>So cowardly; and but for these vile guns,</LINE>
<LINE>He would himself have been a soldier.</LINE>
<LINE>This bald unjointed chat of his, my lord,</LINE>
<LINE>I answer'd indirectly, as I said;</LINE>
<LINE>And I beseech you, let not his report</LINE>
<LINE>Come current for an accusation</LINE>
<LINE>Betwixt my love and your high majesty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR WALTER BLUNT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The circumstance consider'd, good my lord,</LINE>
<LINE>Whate'er Lord Harry Percy then had said</LINE>
<LINE>To such a person and in such a place,</LINE>
<LINE>At such a time, with all the rest retold,</LINE>
<LINE>May reasonably die and never rise</LINE>
<LINE>To do him wrong or any way impeach</LINE>
<LINE>What then he said, so he unsay it now.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY IV</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, yet he doth deny his prisoners,</LINE>
<LINE>But with proviso and exception,</LINE>
<LINE>That we at our own charge shall ransom straight</LINE>
<LINE>His brother-in-law, the foolish Mortimer;</LINE>
<LINE>Who, on my soul, hath wilfully betray'd</LINE>
<LINE>The lives of those that he did lead to fight</LINE>
<LINE>Against that great magician, damn'd Glendower,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose daughter, as we hear, the Earl of March</LINE>
<LINE>Hath lately married. Shall our coffers, then,</LINE>
<LINE>Be emptied to redeem a traitor home?</LINE>
<LINE>Shall we but treason? and indent with fears,</LINE>
<LINE>When they have lost and forfeited themselves?</LINE>
<LINE>No, on the barren mountains let him starve;</LINE>
<LINE>For I shall never hold that man my friend</LINE>
<LINE>Whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost</LINE>
<LINE>To ransom home revolted Mortimer.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Revolted Mortimer!</LINE>
<LINE>He never did fall off, my sovereign liege,</LINE>
<LINE>But by the chance of war; to prove that true</LINE>
<LINE>Needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds,</LINE>
<LINE>Those mouthed wounds, which valiantly he took</LINE>
<LINE>When on the gentle Severn's sedgy bank,</LINE>
<LINE>In single opposition, hand to hand,</LINE>
<LINE>He did confound the best part of an hour</LINE>
<LINE>In changing hardiment with great Glendower:</LINE>
<LINE>Three times they breathed and three times did</LINE>
<LINE>they drink,</LINE>
<LINE>Upon agreement, of swift Severn's flood;</LINE>
<LINE>Who then, affrighted with their bloody looks,</LINE>
<LINE>Ran fearfully among the trembling reeds,</LINE>
<LINE>And hid his crisp head in the hollow bank,</LINE>
<LINE>Bloodstained with these valiant combatants.</LINE>
<LINE>Never did base and rotten policy</LINE>
<LINE>Colour her working with such deadly wounds;</LINE>
<LINE>Nor could the noble Mortimer</LINE>
<LINE>Receive so many, and all willingly:</LINE>
<LINE>Then let not him be slander'd with revolt.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY IV</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou dost belie him, Percy, thou dost belie him;</LINE>
<LINE>He never did encounter with Glendower:</LINE>
<LINE>I tell thee,</LINE>
<LINE>He durst as well have met the devil alone</LINE>
<LINE>As Owen Glendower for an enemy.</LINE>
<LINE>Art thou not ashamed? But, sirrah, henceforth</LINE>
<LINE>Let me not hear you speak of Mortimer:</LINE>
<LINE>Send me your prisoners with the speediest means,</LINE>
<LINE>Or you shall hear in such a kind from me</LINE>
<LINE>As will displease you. My Lord Northumberland,</LINE>
<LINE>We licence your departure with your son.</LINE>
<LINE>Send us your prisoners, or you will hear of it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt King Henry, Blunt, and train</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>An if the devil come and roar for them,</LINE>
<LINE>I will not send them: I will after straight</LINE>
<LINE>And tell him so; for I will ease my heart,</LINE>
<LINE>Albeit I make a hazard of my head.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NORTHUMBERLAND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, drunk with choler? stay and pause awhile:</LINE>
<LINE>Here comes your uncle.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Re-enter WORCESTER</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Speak of Mortimer!</LINE>
<LINE>'Zounds, I will speak of him; and let my soul</LINE>
<LINE>Want mercy, if I do not join with him:</LINE>
<LINE>Yea, on his part I'll empty all these veins,</LINE>
<LINE>And shed my dear blood drop by drop in the dust,</LINE>
<LINE>But I will lift the down-trod Mortimer</LINE>
<LINE>As high in the air as this unthankful king,</LINE>
<LINE>As this ingrate and canker'd Bolingbroke.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NORTHUMBERLAND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Brother, the king hath made your nephew mad.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EARL OF WORCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who struck this heat up after I was gone?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He will, forsooth, have all my prisoners;</LINE>
<LINE>And when I urged the ransom once again</LINE>
<LINE>Of my wife's brother, then his cheek look'd pale,</LINE>
<LINE>And on my face he turn'd an eye of death,</LINE>
<LINE>Trembling even at the name of Mortimer.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EARL OF WORCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I cannot blame him: was not he proclaim'd</LINE>
<LINE>By Richard that dead is the next of blood?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NORTHUMBERLAND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He was; I heard the proclamation:</LINE>
<LINE>And then it was when the unhappy king,</LINE>
<LINE>--Whose wrongs in us God pardon!--did set forth</LINE>
<LINE>Upon his Irish expedition;</LINE>
<LINE>From whence he intercepted did return</LINE>
<LINE>To be deposed and shortly murdered.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EARL OF WORCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And for whose death we in the world's wide mouth</LINE>
<LINE>Live scandalized and foully spoken of.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But soft, I pray you; did King Richard then</LINE>
<LINE>Proclaim my brother Edmund Mortimer</LINE>
<LINE>Heir to the crown?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NORTHUMBERLAND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He did; myself did hear it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, then I cannot blame his cousin king,</LINE>
<LINE>That wished him on the barren mountains starve.</LINE>
<LINE>But shall it be that you, that set the crown</LINE>
<LINE>Upon the head of this forgetful man</LINE>
<LINE>And for his sake wear the detested blot</LINE>
<LINE>Of murderous subornation, shall it be,</LINE>
<LINE>That you a world of curses undergo,</LINE>
<LINE>Being the agents, or base second means,</LINE>
<LINE>The cords, the ladder, or the hangman rather?</LINE>
<LINE>O, pardon me that I descend so low,</LINE>
<LINE>To show the line and the predicament</LINE>
<LINE>Wherein you range under this subtle king;</LINE>
<LINE>Shall it for shame be spoken in these days,</LINE>
<LINE>Or fill up chronicles in time to come,</LINE>
<LINE>That men of your nobility and power</LINE>
<LINE>Did gage them both in an unjust behalf,</LINE>
<LINE>As both of you--God pardon it!--have done,</LINE>
<LINE>To put down Richard, that sweet lovely rose,</LINE>
<LINE>An plant this thorn, this canker, Bolingbroke?</LINE>
<LINE>And shall it in more shame be further spoken,</LINE>
<LINE>That you are fool'd, discarded and shook off</LINE>
<LINE>By him for whom these shames ye underwent?</LINE>
<LINE>No; yet time serves wherein you may redeem</LINE>
<LINE>Your banish'd honours and restore yourselves</LINE>
<LINE>Into the good thoughts of the world again,</LINE>
<LINE>Revenge the jeering and disdain'd contempt</LINE>
<LINE>Of this proud king, who studies day and night</LINE>
<LINE>To answer all the debt he owes to you</LINE>
<LINE>Even with the bloody payment of your deaths:</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore, I say--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EARL OF WORCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Peace, cousin, say no more:</LINE>
<LINE>And now I will unclasp a secret book,</LINE>
<LINE>And to your quick-conceiving discontents</LINE>
<LINE>I'll read you matter deep and dangerous,</LINE>
<LINE>As full of peril and adventurous spirit</LINE>
<LINE>As to o'er-walk a current roaring loud</LINE>
<LINE>On the unsteadfast footing of a spear.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If he fall in, good night! or sink or swim:</LINE>
<LINE>Send danger from the east unto the west,</LINE>
<LINE>So honour cross it from the north to south,</LINE>
<LINE>And let them grapple: O, the blood more stirs</LINE>
<LINE>To rouse a lion than to start a hare!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NORTHUMBERLAND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Imagination of some great exploit</LINE>
<LINE>Drives him beyond the bounds of patience.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By heaven, methinks it were an easy leap,</LINE>
<LINE>To pluck bright honour from the pale-faced moon,</LINE>
<LINE>Or dive into the bottom of the deep,</LINE>
<LINE>Where fathom-line could never touch the ground,</LINE>
<LINE>And pluck up drowned honour by the locks;</LINE>
<LINE>So he that doth redeem her thence might wear</LINE>
<LINE>Without corrival, all her dignities:</LINE>
<LINE>But out upon this half-faced fellowship!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EARL OF WORCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He apprehends a world of figures here,</LINE>
<LINE>But not the form of what he should attend.</LINE>
<LINE>Good cousin, give me audience for a while.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I cry you mercy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EARL OF WORCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Those same noble Scots</LINE>
<LINE>That are your prisoners,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll keep them all;</LINE>
<LINE>By God, he shall not have a Scot of them;</LINE>
<LINE>No, if a Scot would save his soul, he shall not:</LINE>
<LINE>I'll keep them, by this hand.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EARL OF WORCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You start away</LINE>
<LINE>And lend no ear unto my purposes.</LINE>
<LINE>Those prisoners you shall keep.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, I will; that's flat:</LINE>
<LINE>He said he would not ransom Mortimer;</LINE>
<LINE>Forbad my tongue to speak of Mortimer;</LINE>
<LINE>But I will find him when he lies asleep,</LINE>
<LINE>And in his ear I'll holla 'Mortimer!'</LINE>
<LINE>Nay,</LINE>
<LINE>I'll have a starling shall be taught to speak</LINE>
<LINE>Nothing but 'Mortimer,' and give it him</LINE>
<LINE>To keep his anger still in motion.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EARL OF WORCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hear you, cousin; a word.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>All studies here I solemnly defy,</LINE>
<LINE>Save how to gall and pinch this Bolingbroke:</LINE>
<LINE>And that same sword-and-buckler Prince of Wales,</LINE>
<LINE>But that I think his father loves him not</LINE>
<LINE>And would be glad he met with some mischance,</LINE>
<LINE>I would have him poison'd with a pot of ale.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EARL OF WORCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Farewell, kinsman: I'll talk to you</LINE>
<LINE>When you are better temper'd to attend.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NORTHUMBERLAND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, what a wasp-stung and impatient fool</LINE>
<LINE>Art thou to break into this woman's mood,</LINE>
<LINE>Tying thine ear to no tongue but thine own!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, look you, I am whipp'd and scourged with rods,</LINE>
<LINE>Nettled and stung with pismires, when I hear</LINE>
<LINE>Of this vile politician, Bolingbroke.</LINE>
<LINE>In Richard's time,--what do you call the place?--</LINE>
<LINE>A plague upon it, it is in Gloucestershire;</LINE>
<LINE>'Twas where the madcap duke his uncle kept,</LINE>
<LINE>His uncle York; where I first bow'd my knee</LINE>
<LINE>Unto this king of smiles, this Bolingbroke,--</LINE>
<LINE>'Sblood!--</LINE>
<LINE>When you and he came back from Ravenspurgh.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NORTHUMBERLAND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>At Berkley castle.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You say true:</LINE>
<LINE>Why, what a candy deal of courtesy</LINE>
<LINE>This fawning greyhound then did proffer me!</LINE>
<LINE>Look,'when his infant fortune came to age,'</LINE>
<LINE>And 'gentle Harry Percy,' and 'kind cousin;'</LINE>
<LINE>O, the devil take such cozeners! God forgive me!</LINE>
<LINE>Good uncle, tell your tale; I have done.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EARL OF WORCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, if you have not, to it again;</LINE>
<LINE>We will stay your leisure.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have done, i' faith.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EARL OF WORCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then once more to your Scottish prisoners.</LINE>
<LINE>Deliver them up without their ransom straight,</LINE>
<LINE>And make the Douglas' son your only mean</LINE>
<LINE>For powers in Scotland; which, for divers reasons</LINE>
<LINE>Which I shall send you written, be assured,</LINE>
<LINE>Will easily be granted. You, my lord,</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>To Northumberland</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Your son in Scotland being thus employ'd,</LINE>
<LINE>Shall secretly into the bosom creep</LINE>
<LINE>Of that same noble prelate, well beloved,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Of York, is it not?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EARL OF WORCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>True; who bears hard</LINE>
<LINE>His brother's death at Bristol, the Lord Scroop.</LINE>
<LINE>I speak not this in estimation,</LINE>
<LINE>As what I think might be, but what I know</LINE>
<LINE>Is ruminated, plotted and set down,</LINE>
<LINE>And only stays but to behold the face</LINE>
<LINE>Of that occasion that shall bring it on.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>I smell it: upon my life, it will do well.</LINE>

<LINE>Before the game is afoot, thou still let'st slip.</LINE>

<LINE>Why, it cannot choose but be a noble plot;</LINE>
<LINE>And then the power of Scotland and of York,</LINE>

<SPEAKER>EARL OF WORCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And so they shall.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In faith, it is exceedingly well aim'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EARL OF WORCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And 'tis no little reason bids us speed,</LINE>
<LINE>To save our heads by raising of a head;</LINE>
<LINE>For, bear ourselves as even as we can,</LINE>
<LINE>The king will always think him in our debt,</LINE>
<LINE>And think we think ourselves unsatisfied,</LINE>
<LINE>Till he hath found a time to pay us home:</LINE>
<LINE>And see already how he doth begin</LINE>
<LINE>To make us strangers to his looks of love.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>Cousin, farewell: no further go in this</LINE>

<LINE>When time is ripe, which will be suddenly,</LINE>

<LINE><STAGEDIR>Within</STAGEDIR>  At hand, quoth pick-purse.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GADSHILL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That's even as fair as--at hand, quoth the</LINE>
<LINE>chamberlain; for thou variest no more from picking</LINE>
<LINE>of purses than giving direction doth from labouring;</LINE>
<LINE>thou layest the plot how.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Chamberlain</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Chamberlain</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good morrow, Master Gadshill. It holds current that</LINE>
<LINE>I told you yesternight: there's a franklin in the</LINE>
<LINE>wild of Kent hath brought three hundred marks with</LINE>
<LINE>him in gold: I heard him tell it to one of his</LINE>
<LINE>company last night at supper; a kind of auditor; one</LINE>
<LINE>that hath abundance of charge too, God knows what.</LINE>
<LINE>They are up already, and call for eggs and butter;</LINE>
<LINE>they will away presently.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GADSHILL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sirrah, if they meet not with Saint Nicholas'</LINE>
<LINE>clerks, I'll give thee this neck.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Chamberlain</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, I'll none of it: I pray thee keep that for the</LINE>
<LINE>hangman; for I know thou worshippest St. Nicholas</LINE>
<LINE>as truly as a man of falsehood may.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GADSHILL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What talkest thou to me of the hangman? if I hang,</LINE>
<LINE>I'll make a fat pair of gallows; for if I hang, old</LINE>
<LINE>Sir John hangs with me, and thou knowest he is no</LINE>
<LINE>starveling. Tut! there are other Trojans that thou</LINE>
<LINE>dreamest not of, the which for sport sake are</LINE>
<LINE>content to do the profession some grace; that would,</LINE>
<LINE>if matters should be looked into, for their own</LINE>
<LINE>credit sake, make all whole. I am joined with no</LINE>
<LINE>foot-land rakers, no long-staff sixpenny strikers,</LINE>
<LINE>none of these mad mustachio purple-hued malt-worms;</LINE>
<LINE>but with nobility and tranquillity, burgomasters and</LINE>
<LINE>great oneyers, such as can hold in, such as will</LINE>
<LINE>strike sooner than speak, and speak sooner than</LINE>
<LINE>drink, and drink sooner than pray: and yet, zounds,</LINE>
<LINE>I lie; for they pray continually to their saint, the</LINE>
<LINE>commonwealth; or rather, not pray to her, but prey</LINE>
<LINE>on her, for they ride up and down on her and make</LINE>
<LINE>her their boots.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Chamberlain</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, the commonwealth their boots? will she hold</LINE>
<LINE>out water in foul way?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GADSHILL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She will, she will; justice hath liquored her. We</LINE>
<LINE>steal as in a castle, cocksure; we have the receipt</LINE>
<LINE>of fern-seed, we walk invisible.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Chamberlain</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, by my faith, I think you are more beholding to</LINE>
<LINE>the night than to fern-seed for your walking invisible.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GADSHILL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Give me thy hand: thou shalt have a share in our</LINE>
<LINE>purchase, as I am a true man.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Chamberlain</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, rather let me have it, as you are a false thief.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am accursed to rob in that thief's company: the</LINE>
<LINE>rascal hath removed my horse, and tied him I know</LINE>
<LINE>not where. If I travel but four foot by the squier</LINE>
<LINE>further afoot, I shall break my wind. Well, I doubt</LINE>
<LINE>not but to die a fair death for all this, if I</LINE>
<LINE>'scape hanging for killing that rogue. I have</LINE>
<LINE>forsworn his company hourly any time this two and</LINE>
<LINE>twenty years, and yet I am bewitched with the</LINE>
<LINE>rogue's company. If the rascal hath not given me</LINE>
<LINE>medicines to make me love him, I'll be hanged; it</LINE>
<LINE>could not be else: I have drunk medicines. Poins!</LINE>
<LINE>Hal! a plague upon you both! Bardolph! Peto!</LINE>
<LINE>I'll starve ere I'll rob a foot further. An 'twere</LINE>
<LINE>not as good a deed as drink, to turn true man and to</LINE>
<LINE>leave these rogues, I am the veriest varlet that</LINE>
<LINE>ever chewed with a tooth. Eight yards of uneven</LINE>
<LINE>ground is threescore and ten miles afoot with me;</LINE>
<LINE>and the stony-hearted villains know it well enough:</LINE>
<LINE>a plague upon it when thieves cannot be true one to another!</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>They whistle</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Whew! A plague upon you all! Give me my horse, you</LINE>
<LINE>rogues; give me my horse, and be hanged!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Peace, ye fat-guts! lie down; lay thine ear close</LINE>

<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Have you any levers to lift me up again, being down?</LINE>

<LINE>Go, hang thyself in thine own heir-apparent</LINE>

<LINE>'But for mine own part, my lord, I could be well</LINE>
<LINE>contented to be there, in respect of the love I bear</LINE>
<LINE>your house.' He could be contented: why is he not,</LINE>
<LINE>then? In respect of the love he bears our house:</LINE>
<LINE>he shows in this, he loves his own barn better than</LINE>
<LINE>he loves our house. Let me see some more. 'The</LINE>
<LINE>purpose you undertake is dangerous;'--why, that's</LINE>
<LINE>certain: 'tis dangerous to take a cold, to sleep, to</LINE>
<LINE>drink; but I tell you, my lord fool, out of this</LINE>
<LINE>nettle, danger, we pluck this flower, safety. 'The</LINE>
<LINE>purpose you undertake is dangerous; the friends you</LINE>
<LINE>have named uncertain; the time itself unsorted; and</LINE>
<LINE>your whole plot too light for the counterpoise of so</LINE>
<LINE>great an opposition.' Say you so, say you so? I say</LINE>
<LINE>unto you again, you are a shallow cowardly hind, and</LINE>
<LINE>you lie.  What a lack-brain is this! By the Lord,</LINE>
<LINE>our plot is a good plot as ever was laid; our</LINE>

<LINE>friends, and full of expectation; an excellent plot,</LINE>

<LINE>Why dost thou bend thine eyes upon the earth,</LINE>

<LINE>Why hast thou lost the fresh blood in thy cheeks;</LINE>
<LINE>And given my treasures and my rights of thee</LINE>
<LINE>To thick-eyed musing and cursed melancholy?</LINE>
<LINE>In thy faint slumbers I by thee have watch'd,</LINE>
<LINE>And heard thee murmur tales of iron wars;</LINE>
<LINE>Speak terms of manage to thy bounding steed;</LINE>
<LINE>Cry 'Courage! to the field!' And thou hast talk'd</LINE>
<LINE>Of sallies and retires, of trenches, tents,</LINE>
<LINE>Of palisadoes, frontiers, parapets,</LINE>
<LINE>Of basilisks, of cannon, culverin,</LINE>
<LINE>Of prisoners' ransom and of soldiers slain,</LINE>
<LINE>And all the currents of a heady fight.</LINE>
<LINE>Thy spirit within thee hath been so at war</LINE>
<LINE>And thus hath so bestirr'd thee in thy sleep,</LINE>
<LINE>That beads of sweat have stood upon thy brow</LINE>
<LINE>Like bubbles in a late-disturbed stream;</LINE>
<LINE>And in thy face strange motions have appear'd,</LINE>
<LINE>Such as we see when men restrain their breath</LINE>
<LINE>On some great sudden hest. O, what portents are these?</LINE>

<LINE>their christen names, as Tom, Dick, and Francis.</LINE>
<LINE>They take it already upon their salvation, that</LINE>
<LINE>though I be but the prince of Wales, yet I am king</LINE>
<LINE>of courtesy; and tell me flatly I am no proud Jack,</LINE>
<LINE>like Falstaff, but a Corinthian, a lad of mettle, a</LINE>
<LINE>good boy, by the Lord, so they call me, and when I</LINE>
<LINE>am king of England, I shall command all the good</LINE>
<LINE>lads in Eastcheap. They call drinking deep, dyeing</LINE>
<LINE>scarlet; and when you breathe in your watering, they</LINE>
<LINE>cry  'hem!' and bid you play it off. To conclude, I</LINE>
<LINE>am so good a proficient in one quarter of an hour,</LINE>
<LINE>that I can drink with any tinker in his own language</LINE>
<LINE>during my life. I tell thee, Ned, thou hast lost</LINE>

<LINE>action. But, sweet Ned,--to sweeten which name of</LINE>
<LINE>Ned, I give thee this pennyworth of sugar, clapped</LINE>
<LINE>even now into my hand by an under-skinker, one that</LINE>
<LINE>never spake other English in his life than 'Eight</LINE>
<LINE>shillings and sixpence' and 'You are welcome,' with</LINE>
<LINE>this shrill addition, 'Anon, anon, sir! Score a pint</LINE>
<LINE>of bastard in the Half-Moon,' or so. But, Ned, to</LINE>
<LINE>drive away the time till Falstaff come, I prithee,</LINE>
<LINE>do thou stand in some by-room, while I question my</LINE>
<LINE>puny drawer to what end he gave me the sugar; and do</LINE>
<LINE>thou never leave calling 'Francis,' that his tale</LINE>
<LINE>to me may be nothing but 'Anon.' Step aside, and</LINE>
<LINE>I'll show thee a precedent.</LINE>

<LINE>That ever this fellow should have fewer words than a</LINE>
<LINE>parrot, and yet the son of a woman! His industry is</LINE>
<LINE>upstairs and downstairs; his eloquence the parcel of</LINE>
<LINE>a reckoning. I am not yet of Percy's mind, the</LINE>
<LINE>Hotspur of the north; he that kills me some six or</LINE>
<LINE>seven dozen of Scots at a breakfast, washes his</LINE>
<LINE>hands, and says to his wife 'Fie upon this quiet</LINE>
<LINE>life! I want work.' 'O my sweet Harry,' says she,</LINE>
<LINE>'how many hast thou killed to-day?' 'Give my roan</LINE>
<LINE>horse a drench,' says he; and answers 'Some</LINE>
<LINE>fourteen,' an hour after; 'a trifle, a trifle.' I</LINE>
<LINE>prithee, call in Falstaff: I'll play Percy, and</LINE>
<LINE>that damned brawn shall play Dame Mortimer his</LINE>
<LINE>wife. 'Rivo!' says the drunkard. Call in ribs, call in tallow.</LINE>

<LINE>Welcome, Jack: where hast thou been?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A plague of all cowards, I say, and a vengeance too!</LINE>
<LINE>marry, and amen! Give me a cup of sack, boy. Ere I</LINE>
<LINE>lead this life long, I'll sew nether stocks and mend</LINE>

<LINE>Give me a cup of sack, rogue. Is there no virtue extant?</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You rogue, here's lime in this sack too: there is</LINE>
<LINE>nothing but roguery to be found in villanous man:</LINE>
<LINE>yet a coward is worse than a cup of sack with lime</LINE>
<LINE>in it. A villanous coward! Go thy ways, old Jack;</LINE>
<LINE>die when thou wilt, if manhood, good manhood, be</LINE>
<LINE>not forgot upon the face of the earth, then am I a</LINE>
<LINE>shotten herring. There live not three good men</LINE>
<LINE>unhanged in England; and one of them is fat and</LINE>
<LINE>grows old: God help the while! a bad world, I say.</LINE>
<LINE>I would I were a weaver; I could sing psalms or any</LINE>
<LINE>thing. A plague of all cowards, I say still.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How now, wool-sack! what mutter you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A king's son! If I do not beat thee out of thy</LINE>

<LINE>subjects afore thee like a flock of wild-geese,</LINE>
<LINE>I'll never wear hair on my face more. You Prince of Wales!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, you whoreson round man, what's the matter?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Are not you a coward? answer me to that: and Poins there?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Lord, I'll stab thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I call thee coward! I'll see thee damned ere I call</LINE>
<LINE>thee coward: but I would give a thousand pound I</LINE>
<LINE>could run as fast as thou canst. You are straight</LINE>
<LINE>enough in the shoulders, you care not who sees your</LINE>
<LINE>back: call you that backing of your friends? A</LINE>
<LINE>plague upon such backing! give me them that will</LINE>
<LINE>face me. Give me a cup of sack: I am a rogue, if I</LINE>
<LINE>drunk to-day.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O villain! thy lips are scarce wiped since thou</LINE>
<LINE>drunkest last.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>All's one for that.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>He drinks</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>A plague of all cowards, still say I.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What's the matter?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What's the matter! there be four of us here have</LINE>
<LINE>ta'en a thousand pound this day morning.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where is it, Jack? where is it?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where is it! taken from us it is: a hundred upon</LINE>
<LINE>poor four of us.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, a hundred, man?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am a rogue, if I were not at half-sword with a</LINE>
<LINE>dozen of them two hours together. I have 'scaped by</LINE>
<LINE>miracle. I am eight times thrust through the</LINE>
<LINE>doublet, four through the hose; my buckler cut</LINE>
<LINE>through and through; my sword hacked like a</LINE>
<LINE>hand-saw--ecce signum! I never dealt better since</LINE>
<LINE>I was a man: all would not do. A plague of all</LINE>
<LINE>cowards! Let them speak: if they speak more or</LINE>
<LINE>less than truth, they are villains and the sons of darkness.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Speak, sirs; how was it?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GADSHILL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We four set upon some dozen--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sixteen at least, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GADSHILL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And bound them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, no, they were not bound.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You rogue, they were bound, every man of them; or I</LINE>
<LINE>am a Jew else, an Ebrew Jew.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GADSHILL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As we were sharing, some six or seven fresh men set upon us--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And unbound the rest, and then come in the other.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, fought you with them all?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>All! I know not what you call all; but if I fought</LINE>
<LINE>not with fifty of them, I am a bunch of radish: if</LINE>
<LINE>there were not two or three and fifty upon poor old</LINE>
<LINE>Jack, then am I no two-legged creature.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pray God you have not murdered some of them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, that's past praying for: I have peppered two</LINE>
<LINE>of them; two I am sure I have paid, two rogues</LINE>
<LINE>in buckram suits. I tell thee what, Hal, if I tell</LINE>
<LINE>thee a lie, spit in my face, call me horse. Thou</LINE>
<LINE>knowest my old ward; here I lay and thus I bore my</LINE>
<LINE>point. Four rogues in buckram let drive at me--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, four? thou saidst but two even now.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Four, Hal; I told thee four.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POINS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, ay, he said four.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>These four came all a-front, and mainly thrust at</LINE>
<LINE>me. I made me no more ado but took all their seven</LINE>
<LINE>points in my target, thus.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Seven? why, there were but four even now.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In buckram?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POINS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, four, in buckram suits.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Seven, by these hilts, or I am a villain else.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Prithee, let him alone; we shall have more anon.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Dost thou hear me, Hal?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, and mark thee too, Jack.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do so, for it is worth the listening to. These nine</LINE>
<LINE>in buckram that I told thee of--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So, two more already.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Their points being broken,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POINS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Down fell their hose.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Began to give me ground: but I followed me close,</LINE>
<LINE>came in foot and hand; and with a thought seven of</LINE>
<LINE>the eleven I paid.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O monstrous! eleven buckram men grown out of two!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But, as the devil would have it, three misbegotten</LINE>
<LINE>knaves in Kendal green came at my back and let drive</LINE>
<LINE>at me; for it was so dark, Hal, that thou couldst</LINE>
<LINE>not see thy hand.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>These lies are like their father that begets them;</LINE>
<LINE>gross as a mountain, open, palpable. Why, thou</LINE>
<LINE>clay-brained guts, thou knotty-pated fool, thou</LINE>
<LINE>whoreson, obscene, grease tallow-catch,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, art thou mad? art thou mad? is not the truth</LINE>
<LINE>the truth?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, how couldst thou know these men in Kendal</LINE>
<LINE>green, when it was so dark thou couldst not see thy</LINE>
<LINE>hand? come, tell us your reason: what sayest thou to this?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POINS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, your reason, Jack, your reason.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, upon compulsion? 'Zounds, an I were at the</LINE>
<LINE>strappado, or all the racks in the world, I would</LINE>
<LINE>not tell you on compulsion. Give you a reason on</LINE>
<LINE>compulsion! If reasons were as plentiful as</LINE>
<LINE>blackberries, I would give no man a reason upon</LINE>
<LINE>compulsion, I.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll be no longer guilty of this sin; this sanguine</LINE>
<LINE>coward, this bed-presser, this horseback-breaker,</LINE>
<LINE>this huge hill of flesh,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Sblood, you starveling, you elf-skin, you dried</LINE>
<LINE>neat's tongue, you bull's pizzle, you stock-fish! O</LINE>
<LINE>for breath to utter what is like thee! you</LINE>
<LINE>tailor's-yard, you sheath, you bowcase; you vile</LINE>
<LINE>standing-tuck,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, breathe awhile, and then to it again: and</LINE>
<LINE>when thou hast tired thyself in base comparisons,</LINE>
<LINE>hear me speak but this.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POINS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Mark, Jack.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We two saw you four set on four and bound them, and</LINE>
<LINE>were masters of their wealth. Mark now, how a plain</LINE>
<LINE>tale shall put you down. Then did we two set on you</LINE>
<LINE>four; and, with a word, out-faced you from your</LINE>
<LINE>prize, and have it; yea, and can show it you here in</LINE>
<LINE>the house: and, Falstaff, you carried your guts</LINE>
<LINE>away as nimbly, with as quick dexterity, and roared</LINE>
<LINE>for mercy and still run and roared, as ever I heard</LINE>
<LINE>bull-calf. What a slave art thou, to hack thy sword</LINE>
<LINE>as thou hast done, and then say it was in fight!</LINE>
<LINE>What trick, what device, what starting-hole, canst</LINE>
<LINE>thou now find out to hide thee from this open and</LINE>
<LINE>apparent shame?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POINS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, let's hear, Jack; what trick hast thou now?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By the Lord, I knew ye as well as he that made ye.</LINE>
<LINE>Why, hear you, my masters: was it for me to kill the</LINE>
<LINE>heir-apparent? should I turn upon the true prince?</LINE>
<LINE>why, thou knowest I am as valiant as Hercules: but</LINE>
<LINE>beware instinct; the lion will not touch the true</LINE>
<LINE>prince. Instinct is a great matter; I was now a</LINE>
<LINE>coward on instinct. I shall think the better of</LINE>
<LINE>myself and thee during my life; I for a valiant</LINE>
<LINE>lion, and thou for a true prince. But, by the Lord,</LINE>
<LINE>lads, I am glad you have the money. Hostess, clap</LINE>
<LINE>to the doors: watch to-night, pray to-morrow.</LINE>
<LINE>Gallants, lads, boys, hearts of gold, all the titles</LINE>
<LINE>of good fellowship come to you! What, shall we be</LINE>
<LINE>merry? shall we have a play extempore?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Content; and the argument shall be thy running away.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Hostess</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, my lord, there is a nobleman of the court at</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Give him as much as will make him a royal man, and</LINE>
<LINE>send him back again to my mother.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What manner of man is he?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>Prithee, do, Jack.</LINE>

<LINE>Now, sirs: by'r lady, you fought fair; so did you,</LINE>

<LINE>'Faith, tell me now in earnest, how came Falstaff's</LINE>
<LINE>sword so hacked?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, he hacked it with his dagger, and said he would</LINE>
<LINE>swear truth out of England but he would make you</LINE>
<LINE>believe it was done in fight, and persuaded us to do the like.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>BARDOLPH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yea, and to tickle our noses with spear-grass to</LINE>
<LINE>make them bleed, and then to beslubber our garments</LINE>
<LINE>with it and swear it was the blood of true men. I</LINE>
<LINE>did that I did not this seven year before, I blushed</LINE>
<LINE>to hear his monstrous devices.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O villain, thou stolest a cup of sack eighteen years</LINE>
<LINE>ago, and wert taken with the manner, and ever since</LINE>
<LINE>thou hast blushed extempore. Thou hadst fire and</LINE>
<LINE>sword on thy side, and yet thou rannest away: what</LINE>
<LINE>instinct hadst thou for it?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BARDOLPH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, do you see these meteors? do you behold</LINE>
<LINE>these exhalations?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BARDOLPH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What think you they portend?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hot livers and cold purses.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BARDOLPH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Choler, my lord, if rightly taken.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, if rightly taken, halter.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Re-enter FALSTAFF</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Here comes lean Jack, here comes bare-bone.</LINE>
<LINE>How now, my sweet creature of bombast!</LINE>
<LINE>How long is't ago, Jack, since thou sawest thine own knee?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My own knee! when I was about thy years, Hal, I was</LINE>
<LINE>not an eagle's talon in the waist; I could have</LINE>
<LINE>crept into any alderman's thumb-ring: a plague of</LINE>
<LINE>sighing and grief! it blows a man up like a</LINE>
<LINE>bladder. There's villanous news abroad: here was</LINE>
<LINE>Sir John Bracy from your father; you must to the</LINE>
<LINE>court in the morning. That same mad fellow of the</LINE>
<LINE>north, Percy, and he of Wales, that gave Amamon the</LINE>
<LINE>bastinado and made Lucifer cuckold and swore the</LINE>
<LINE>devil his true liegeman upon the cross of a Welsh</LINE>
<LINE>hook--what a plague call you him?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POINS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, Glendower.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Owen, Owen, the same; and his son-in-law Mortimer,</LINE>
<LINE>and old Northumberland, and that sprightly Scot of</LINE>
<LINE>Scots, Douglas, that runs o' horseback up a hill</LINE>
<LINE>perpendicular,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He that rides at high speed and with his pistol</LINE>
<LINE>kills a sparrow flying.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You have hit it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So did he never the sparrow.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, that rascal hath good mettle in him; he will not run.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, what a rascal art thou then, to praise him so</LINE>
<LINE>for running!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O' horseback, ye cuckoo; but afoot he will not budge a foot.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, Jack, upon instinct.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I grant ye, upon instinct. Well, he is there too,</LINE>
<LINE>and one Mordake, and a thousand blue-caps more:</LINE>
<LINE>Worcester is stolen away to-night; thy father's</LINE>
<LINE>beard is turned white with the news: you may buy</LINE>
<LINE>land now as cheap as stinking mackerel.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, then, it is like, if there come a hot June and</LINE>
<LINE>this civil buffeting hold, we shall buy maidenheads</LINE>
<LINE>as they buy hob-nails, by the hundreds.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By the mass, lad, thou sayest true; it is like we</LINE>
<LINE>shall have good trading that way. But tell me, Hal,</LINE>
<LINE>art not thou horrible afeard? thou being</LINE>
<LINE>heir-apparent, could the world pick thee out three</LINE>
<LINE>such enemies again as that fiend Douglas, that</LINE>
<LINE>spirit Percy, and that devil Glendower? Art thou</LINE>
<LINE>not horribly afraid? doth not thy blood thrill at</LINE>
<LINE>it?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not a whit, i' faith; I lack some of thy instinct.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, thou wert be horribly chid tomorrow when thou</LINE>
<LINE>comest to thy father: if thou love me, practise an answer.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do thou stand for my father, and examine me upon the</LINE>
<LINE>particulars of my life.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Shall I? content: this chair shall be my state,</LINE>
<LINE>this dagger my sceptre, and this cushion my crown.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thy state is taken for a joined-stool, thy golden</LINE>
<LINE>sceptre for a leaden dagger, and thy precious rich</LINE>
<LINE>crown for a pitiful bald crown!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, an the fire of grace be not quite out of thee,</LINE>
<LINE>now shalt thou be moved. Give me a cup of sack to</LINE>
<LINE>make my eyes look red, that it may be thought I have</LINE>
<LINE>wept; for I must speak in passion, and I will do it</LINE>
<LINE>in King Cambyses' vein.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, here is my leg.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And here is my speech. Stand aside, nobility.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Hostess</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O Jesu, this is excellent sport, i' faith!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Weep not, sweet queen; for trickling tears are vain.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Hostess</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, the father, how he holds his countenance!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For God's sake, lords, convey my tristful queen;</LINE>
<LINE>For tears do stop the flood-gates of her eyes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Hostess</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O Jesu, he doth it as like one of these harlotry</LINE>
<LINE>players as ever I see!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Peace, good pint-pot; peace, good tickle-brain.</LINE>
<LINE>Harry, I do not only marvel where thou spendest thy</LINE>
<LINE>time, but also how thou art accompanied: for though</LINE>
<LINE>the camomile, the more it is trodden on the faster</LINE>
<LINE>it grows, yet youth, the more it is wasted the</LINE>
<LINE>sooner it wears. That thou art my son, I have</LINE>
<LINE>partly thy mother's word, partly my own opinion,</LINE>
<LINE>but chiefly a villanous trick of thine eye and a</LINE>
<LINE>foolish-hanging of thy nether lip, that doth warrant</LINE>
<LINE>me. If then thou be son to me, here lies the point;</LINE>
<LINE>why, being son to me, art thou so pointed at? Shall</LINE>
<LINE>the blessed sun of heaven prove a micher and eat</LINE>
<LINE>blackberries? a question not to be asked. Shall</LINE>
<LINE>the sun of England prove a thief and take purses? a</LINE>
<LINE>question to be asked. There is a thing, Harry,</LINE>
<LINE>which thou hast often heard of and it is known to</LINE>
<LINE>many in our land by the name of pitch: this pitch,</LINE>
<LINE>as ancient writers do report, doth defile; so doth</LINE>
<LINE>the company thou keepest: for, Harry, now I do not</LINE>
<LINE>speak to thee in drink but in tears, not in</LINE>
<LINE>pleasure but in passion, not in words only, but in</LINE>
<LINE>woes also: and yet there is a virtuous man whom I</LINE>
<LINE>have often noted in thy company, but I know not his name.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What manner of man, an it like your majesty?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A goodly portly man, i' faith, and a corpulent; of a</LINE>
<LINE>cheerful look, a pleasing eye and a most noble</LINE>
<LINE>carriage; and, as I think, his age some fifty, or,</LINE>
<LINE>by'r lady, inclining to three score; and now I</LINE>
<LINE>remember me, his name is Falstaff: if that man</LINE>
<LINE>should be lewdly given, he deceiveth me; for, Harry,</LINE>
<LINE>I see virtue in his looks. If then the tree may be</LINE>
<LINE>known by the fruit, as the fruit by the tree, then,</LINE>
<LINE>peremptorily I speak it, there is virtue in that</LINE>
<LINE>Falstaff: him keep with, the rest banish. And tell</LINE>
<LINE>me now, thou naughty varlet, tell me, where hast</LINE>
<LINE>thou been this month?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Dost thou speak like a king? Do thou stand for me,</LINE>
<LINE>and I'll play my father.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Depose me? if thou dost it half so gravely, so</LINE>
<LINE>majestically, both in word and matter, hang me up by</LINE>
<LINE>the heels for a rabbit-sucker or a poulter's hare.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, here I am set.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And here I stand: judge, my masters.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, Harry, whence come you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My noble lord, from Eastcheap.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The complaints I hear of thee are grievous.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Sblood, my lord, they are false: nay, I'll tickle</LINE>
<LINE>ye for a young prince, i' faith.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Swearest thou, ungracious boy? henceforth ne'er look</LINE>
<LINE>on me. Thou art violently carried away from grace:</LINE>
<LINE>there is a devil haunts thee in the likeness of an</LINE>
<LINE>old fat man; a tun of man is thy companion. Why</LINE>
<LINE>dost thou converse with that trunk of humours, that</LINE>
<LINE>bolting-hutch of beastliness, that swollen parcel</LINE>
<LINE>of dropsies, that huge bombard of sack, that stuffed</LINE>
<LINE>cloak-bag of guts, that roasted Manningtree ox with</LINE>
<LINE>the pudding in his belly, that reverend vice, that</LINE>
<LINE>grey iniquity, that father ruffian, that vanity in</LINE>
<LINE>years? Wherein is he good, but to taste sack and</LINE>
<LINE>drink it? wherein neat and cleanly, but to carve a</LINE>
<LINE>capon and eat it? wherein cunning, but in craft?</LINE>
<LINE>wherein crafty, but in villany? wherein villanous,</LINE>
<LINE>but in all things? wherein worthy, but in nothing?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would your grace would take me with you: whom</LINE>
<LINE>means your grace?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That villanous abominable misleader of youth,</LINE>
<LINE>Falstaff, that old white-bearded Satan.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, the man I know.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know thou dost.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But to say I know more harm in him than in myself,</LINE>
<LINE>were to say more than I know. That he is old, the</LINE>
<LINE>more the pity, his white hairs do witness it; but</LINE>
<LINE>that he is, saving your reverence, a whoremaster,</LINE>
<LINE>that I utterly deny. If sack and sugar be a fault,</LINE>
<LINE>God help the wicked! if to be old and merry be a</LINE>
<LINE>sin, then many an old host that I know is damned: if</LINE>
<LINE>to be fat be to be hated, then Pharaoh's lean kine</LINE>
<LINE>are to be loved. No, my good lord; banish Peto,</LINE>
<LINE>banish Bardolph, banish Poins: but for sweet Jack</LINE>
<LINE>Falstaff, kind Jack Falstaff, true Jack Falstaff,</LINE>
<LINE>valiant Jack Falstaff, and therefore more valiant,</LINE>
<LINE>being, as he is, old Jack Falstaff, banish not him</LINE>
<LINE>thy Harry's company, banish not him thy Harry's</LINE>
<LINE>company: banish plump Jack, and banish all the world.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>I do, I will.</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Hostess</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The sheriff and all the watch are at the door: they</LINE>
<LINE>are come to search the house. Shall I let them in?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Dost thou hear, Hal? never call a true piece of</LINE>
<LINE>gold a counterfeit: thou art essentially mad,</LINE>
<LINE>without seeming so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And thou a natural coward, without instinct.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I deny your major: if you will deny the sheriff,</LINE>
<LINE>so; if not, let him enter: if I become not a cart</LINE>
<LINE>as well as another man, a plague on my bringing up!</LINE>
<LINE>I hope I shall as soon be strangled with a halter as another.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go, hide thee behind the arras: the rest walk up</LINE>
<LINE>above. Now, my masters, for a true face and good</LINE>
<LINE>conscience.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Both which I have had: but their date is out, and</LINE>
<LINE>therefore I'll hide me.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt all except PRINCE HENRY and PETO</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>Enter Sheriff and the Carrier</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Now, master sheriff, what is your will with me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Sheriff</SPEAKER>
<LINE>First, pardon me, my lord. A hue and cry</LINE>
<LINE>Hath follow'd certain men unto this house.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What men?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Sheriff</SPEAKER>
<LINE>One of them is well known, my gracious lord,</LINE>
<LINE>A gross fat man.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Carrier</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As fat as butter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The man, I do assure you, is not here;</LINE>
<LINE>For I myself at this time have employ'd him.</LINE>
<LINE>And, sheriff, I will engage my word to thee</LINE>
<LINE>That I will, by to-morrow dinner-time,</LINE>
<LINE>Send him to answer thee, or any man,</LINE>
<LINE>For any thing he shall be charged withal:</LINE>
<LINE>And so let me entreat you leave the house.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Sheriff</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will, my lord. There are two gentlemen</LINE>
<LINE>Have in this robbery lost three hundred marks.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It may be so: if he have robb'd these men,</LINE>
<LINE>He shall be answerable; and so farewell.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Sheriff</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good night, my noble lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I think it is good morrow, is it not?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Sheriff</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Indeed, my lord, I think it be two o'clock.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt Sheriff and Carrier</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This oily rascal is known as well as Paul's. Go,</LINE>
<LINE>call him forth.</LINE>

<LINE>Falstaff!--Fast asleep behind the arras, and</LINE>
<LINE>snorting like a horse.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hark, how hard he fetches breath. Search his pockets.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>He searcheth his pockets, and findeth certain papers</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>What hast thou found?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nothing but papers, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let's see what they be: read them.</LINE>

<LINE>Item, Bread,        ob.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O monstrous! but one half-penny-worth of bread to</LINE>
<LINE>this intolerable deal of sack! What there is else,</LINE>
<LINE>keep close; we'll read it at more advantage: there</LINE>
<LINE>let him sleep till day. I'll to the court in the</LINE>
<LINE>morning. We must all to the wars, and thy place</LINE>
<LINE>shall be honourable. I'll procure this fat rogue a</LINE>
<LINE>charge of foot; and I know his death will be a</LINE>
<LINE>march of twelve-score. The money shall be paid</LINE>
<LINE>back again with advantage. Be with me betimes in</LINE>
<LINE>the morning; and so, good morrow, Peto.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter HOTSPUR, WORCESTER, MORTIMER, and GLENDOWER</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MORTIMER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>These promises are fair, the parties sure,</LINE>
<LINE>And our induction full of prosperous hope.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lord Mortimer, and cousin Glendower,</LINE>
<LINE>Will you sit down?</LINE>
<LINE>And uncle Worcester: a plague upon it!</LINE>
<LINE>I have forgot the map.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLENDOWER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, here it is.</LINE>
<LINE>Sit, cousin Percy; sit, good cousin Hotspur,</LINE>
<LINE>For by that name as oft as Lancaster</LINE>
<LINE>Doth speak of you, his cheek looks pale and with</LINE>
<LINE>A rising sigh he wisheth you in heaven.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And you in hell, as oft as he hears Owen Glendower spoke of.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLENDOWER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I cannot blame him: at my nativity</LINE>
<LINE>The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,</LINE>
<LINE>Of burning cressets; and at my birth</LINE>
<LINE>The frame and huge foundation of the earth</LINE>
<LINE>Shaked like a coward.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, so it would have done at the same season, if</LINE>
<LINE>your mother's cat had but kittened, though yourself</LINE>
<LINE>had never been born.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLENDOWER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I say the earth did shake when I was born.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And I say the earth was not of my mind,</LINE>
<LINE>If you suppose as fearing you it shook.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLENDOWER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The heavens were all on fire, the earth did tremble.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, then the earth shook to see the heavens on fire,</LINE>
<LINE>And not in fear of your nativity.</LINE>
<LINE>Diseased nature oftentimes breaks forth</LINE>
<LINE>In strange eruptions; oft the teeming earth</LINE>
<LINE>Is with a kind of colic pinch'd and vex'd</LINE>
<LINE>By the imprisoning of unruly wind</LINE>
<LINE>Within her womb; which, for enlargement striving,</LINE>
<LINE>Shakes the old beldam earth and topples down</LINE>
<LINE>Steeples and moss-grown towers. At your birth</LINE>
<LINE>Our grandam earth, having this distemperature,</LINE>
<LINE>In passion shook.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLENDOWER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Cousin, of many men</LINE>
<LINE>I do not bear these crossings. Give me leave</LINE>
<LINE>To tell you once again that at my birth</LINE>
<LINE>The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,</LINE>
<LINE>The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds</LINE>
<LINE>Were strangely clamorous to the frighted fields.</LINE>
<LINE>These signs have mark'd me extraordinary;</LINE>
<LINE>And all the courses of my life do show</LINE>
<LINE>I am not in the roll of common men.</LINE>
<LINE>Where is he living, clipp'd in with the sea</LINE>
<LINE>That chides the banks of England, Scotland, Wales,</LINE>
<LINE>Which calls me pupil, or hath read to me?</LINE>
<LINE>And bring him out that is but woman's son</LINE>
<LINE>Can trace me in the tedious ways of art</LINE>
<LINE>And hold me pace in deep experiments.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I think there's no man speaks better Welsh.</LINE>
<LINE>I'll to dinner.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MORTIMER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Peace, cousin Percy; you will make him mad.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLENDOWER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I can call spirits from the vasty deep.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, so can I, or so can any man;</LINE>
<LINE>But will they come when you do call for them?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLENDOWER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, I can teach you, cousin, to command</LINE>
<LINE>The devil.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And I can teach thee, coz, to shame the devil</LINE>
<LINE>By telling truth: tell truth and shame the devil.</LINE>
<LINE>If thou have power to raise him, bring him hither,</LINE>
<LINE>And I'll be sworn I have power to shame him hence.</LINE>
<LINE>O, while you live, tell truth and shame the devil!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MORTIMER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, come, no more of this unprofitable chat.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLENDOWER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Three times hath Henry Bolingbroke made head</LINE>
<LINE>Against my power; thrice from the banks of Wye</LINE>
<LINE>And sandy-bottom'd Severn have I sent him</LINE>
<LINE>Bootless home and weather-beaten back.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Home without boots, and in foul weather too!</LINE>
<LINE>How 'scapes he agues, in the devil's name?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLENDOWER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, here's the map: shall we divide our right</LINE>
<LINE>According to our threefold order ta'en?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MORTIMER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The archdeacon hath divided it</LINE>
<LINE>Into three limits very equally:</LINE>
<LINE>England, from Trent and Severn hitherto,</LINE>
<LINE>By south and east is to my part assign'd:</LINE>
<LINE>All westward, Wales beyond the Severn shore,</LINE>
<LINE>And all the fertile land within that bound,</LINE>
<LINE>To Owen Glendower: and, dear coz, to you</LINE>
<LINE>The remnant northward, lying off from Trent.</LINE>
<LINE>And our indentures tripartite are drawn;</LINE>
<LINE>Which being sealed interchangeably,</LINE>
<LINE>A business that this night may execute,</LINE>
<LINE>To-morrow, cousin Percy, you and I</LINE>
<LINE>And my good Lord of Worcester will set forth</LINE>
<LINE>To meet your father and the Scottish power,</LINE>
<LINE>As is appointed us, at Shrewsbury.</LINE>
<LINE>My father Glendower is not ready yet,</LINE>
<LINE>Not shall we need his help these fourteen days.</LINE>
<LINE>Within that space you may have drawn together</LINE>
<LINE>Your tenants, friends and neighbouring gentlemen.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLENDOWER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A shorter time shall send me to you, lords:</LINE>
<LINE>And in my conduct shall your ladies come;</LINE>
<LINE>From whom you now must steal and take no leave,</LINE>
<LINE>For there will be a world of water shed</LINE>
<LINE>Upon the parting of your wives and you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Methinks my moiety, north from Burton here,</LINE>
<LINE>In quantity equals not one of yours:</LINE>
<LINE>See how this river comes me cranking in,</LINE>
<LINE>And cuts me from the best of all my land</LINE>
<LINE>A huge half-moon, a monstrous cantle out.</LINE>
<LINE>I'll have the current in this place damm'd up;</LINE>
<LINE>And here the smug and silver Trent shall run</LINE>
<LINE>In a new channel, fair and evenly;</LINE>
<LINE>It shall not wind with such a deep indent,</LINE>
<LINE>To rob me of so rich a bottom here.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLENDOWER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not wind? it shall, it must; you see it doth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MORTIMER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yea, but</LINE>
<LINE>Mark how he bears his course, and runs me up</LINE>
<LINE>With like advantage on the other side;</LINE>
<LINE>Gelding the opposed continent as much</LINE>
<LINE>As on the other side it takes from you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EARL OF WORCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yea, but a little charge will trench him here</LINE>
<LINE>And on this north side win this cape of land;</LINE>
<LINE>And then he runs straight and even.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll have it so: a little charge will do it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLENDOWER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll not have it alter'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Will not you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLENDOWER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, nor you shall not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who shall say me nay?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLENDOWER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, that will I.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let me not understand you, then; speak it in Welsh.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLENDOWER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I can speak English, lord, as well as you;</LINE>
<LINE>For I was train'd up in the English court;</LINE>
<LINE>Where, being but young, I framed to the harp</LINE>
<LINE>Many an English ditty lovely well</LINE>
<LINE>And gave the tongue a helpful ornament,</LINE>
<LINE>A virtue that was never seen in you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry,</LINE>
<LINE>And I am glad of it with all my heart:</LINE>
<LINE>I had rather be a kitten and cry mew</LINE>
<LINE>Than one of these same metre ballad-mongers;</LINE>
<LINE>I had rather hear a brazen canstick turn'd,</LINE>
<LINE>Or a dry wheel grate on the axle-tree;</LINE>
<LINE>And that would set my teeth nothing on edge,</LINE>
<LINE>Nothing so much as mincing poetry:</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis like the forced gait of a shuffling nag.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLENDOWER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, you shall have Trent turn'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do not care: I'll give thrice so much land</LINE>
<LINE>To any well-deserving friend;</LINE>
<LINE>But in the way of bargain, mark ye me,</LINE>
<LINE>I'll cavil on the ninth part of a hair.</LINE>
<LINE>Are the indentures drawn? shall we be gone?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLENDOWER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The moon shines fair; you may away by night:</LINE>
<LINE>I'll haste the writer and withal</LINE>
<LINE>Break with your wives of your departure hence:</LINE>
<LINE>I am afraid my daughter will run mad,</LINE>
<LINE>So much she doteth on her Mortimer.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit GLENDOWER</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MORTIMER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fie, cousin Percy! how you cross my father!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I cannot choose: sometime he angers me</LINE>
<LINE>With telling me of the mouldwarp and the ant,</LINE>
<LINE>Of the dreamer Merlin and his prophecies,</LINE>
<LINE>And of a dragon and a finless fish,</LINE>
<LINE>A clip-wing'd griffin and a moulten raven,</LINE>
<LINE>A couching lion and a ramping cat,</LINE>
<LINE>And such a deal of skimble-skamble stuff</LINE>
<LINE>As puts me from my faith. I tell you what;</LINE>
<LINE>He held me last night at least nine hours</LINE>
<LINE>In reckoning up the several devils' names</LINE>
<LINE>That were his lackeys: I cried 'hum,' and 'well, go to,'</LINE>
<LINE>But mark'd him not a word. O, he is as tedious</LINE>
<LINE>As a tired horse, a railing wife;</LINE>
<LINE>Worse than a smoky house: I had rather live</LINE>
<LINE>With cheese and garlic in a windmill, far,</LINE>
<LINE>Than feed on cates and have him talk to me</LINE>
<LINE>In any summer-house in Christendom.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MORTIMER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In faith, he is a worthy gentleman,</LINE>
<LINE>Exceedingly well read, and profited</LINE>
<LINE>In strange concealments, valiant as a lion</LINE>
<LINE>And as wondrous affable and as bountiful</LINE>
<LINE>As mines of India. Shall I tell you, cousin?</LINE>
<LINE>He holds your temper in a high respect</LINE>
<LINE>And curbs himself even of his natural scope</LINE>
<LINE>When you come 'cross his humour; faith, he does:</LINE>
<LINE>I warrant you, that man is not alive</LINE>
<LINE>Might so have tempted him as you have done,</LINE>
<LINE>Without the taste of danger and reproof:</LINE>
<LINE>But do not use it oft, let me entreat you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EARL OF WORCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In faith, my lord, you are too wilful-blame;</LINE>
<LINE>And since your coming hither have done enough</LINE>
<LINE>To put him quite beside his patience.</LINE>
<LINE>You must needs learn, lord, to amend this fault:</LINE>
<LINE>Though sometimes it show greatness, courage, blood,--</LINE>
<LINE>And that's the dearest grace it renders you,--</LINE>
<LINE>Yet oftentimes it doth present harsh rage,</LINE>
<LINE>Defect of manners, want of government,</LINE>
<LINE>Pride, haughtiness, opinion and disdain:</LINE>
<LINE>The least of which haunting a nobleman</LINE>
<LINE>Loseth men's hearts and leaves behind a stain</LINE>
<LINE>Upon the beauty of all parts besides,</LINE>
<LINE>Beguiling them of commendation.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, I am school'd: good manners be your speed!</LINE>
<LINE>Here come our wives, and let us take our leave.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Re-enter GLENDOWER with the ladies</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MORTIMER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is the deadly spite that angers me;</LINE>
<LINE>My wife can speak no English, I no Welsh.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLENDOWER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My daughter weeps: she will not part with you;</LINE>
<LINE>She'll be a soldier too, she'll to the wars.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MORTIMER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good father, tell her that she and my aunt Percy</LINE>
<LINE>Shall follow in your conduct speedily.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Glendower speaks to her in Welsh, and she
answers him in the same</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLENDOWER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She is desperate here; a peevish self-wind harlotry,</LINE>
<LINE>one that no persuasion can do good upon.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>The lady speaks in Welsh</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MORTIMER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I understand thy looks: that pretty Welsh</LINE>
<LINE>Which thou pour'st down from these swelling heavens</LINE>
<LINE>I am too perfect in; and, but for shame,</LINE>
<LINE>In such a parley should I answer thee.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>The lady speaks again in Welsh</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>I understand thy kisses and thou mine,</LINE>
<LINE>And that's a feeling disputation:</LINE>
<LINE>But I will never be a truant, love,</LINE>
<LINE>Till I have learned thy language; for thy tongue</LINE>
<LINE>Makes Welsh as sweet as ditties highly penn'd,</LINE>
<LINE>Sung by a fair queen in a summer's bower,</LINE>
<LINE>With ravishing division, to her lute.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLENDOWER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, if you melt, then will she run mad.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>The lady speaks again in Welsh</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MORTIMER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, I am ignorance itself in this!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLENDOWER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She bids you on the wanton rushes lay you down</LINE>
<LINE>And rest your gentle head upon her lap,</LINE>
<LINE>And she will sing the song that pleaseth you</LINE>
<LINE>And on your eyelids crown the god of sleep.</LINE>
<LINE>Charming your blood with pleasing heaviness,</LINE>
<LINE>Making such difference 'twixt wake and sleep</LINE>
<LINE>As is the difference betwixt day and night</LINE>
<LINE>The hour before the heavenly-harness'd team</LINE>
<LINE>Begins his golden progress in the east.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MORTIMER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With all my heart I'll sit and hear her sing:</LINE>
<LINE>By that time will our book, I think, be drawn</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLENDOWER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do so;</LINE>
<LINE>And those musicians that shall play to you</LINE>
<LINE>Hang in the air a thousand leagues from hence,</LINE>
<LINE>And straight they shall be here: sit, and attend.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, Kate, thou art perfect in lying down: come,</LINE>
<LINE>quick, quick, that I may lay my head in thy lap.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY PERCY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go, ye giddy goose.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>The music plays</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now I perceive the devil understands Welsh;</LINE>
<LINE>And 'tis no marvel he is so humorous.</LINE>
<LINE>By'r lady, he is a good musician.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY PERCY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then should you be nothing but musical for you are</LINE>
<LINE>altogether governed by humours. Lie still, ye thief,</LINE>
<LINE>and hear the lady sing in Welsh.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I had rather hear Lady, my brach, howl in Irish.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY PERCY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Wouldst thou have thy head broken?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY PERCY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then be still.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Neither;'tis a woman's fault.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY PERCY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now God help thee!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To the Welsh lady's bed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY PERCY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What's that?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Peace! she sings.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Here the lady sings a Welsh song</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, Kate, I'll have your song too.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY PERCY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not mine, in good sooth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not yours, in good sooth! Heart! you swear like a</LINE>
<LINE>comfit-maker's wife. 'Not you, in good sooth,' and</LINE>
<LINE>'as true as I live,' and 'as God shall mend me,' and</LINE>
<LINE>'as sure as day,'</LINE>
<LINE>And givest such sarcenet surety for thy oaths,</LINE>
<LINE>As if thou never walk'st further than Finsbury.</LINE>
<LINE>Swear me, Kate, like a lady as thou art,</LINE>
<LINE>A good mouth-filling oath, and leave 'in sooth,'</LINE>
<LINE>And such protest of pepper-gingerbread,</LINE>
<LINE>To velvet-guards and Sunday-citizens.</LINE>
<LINE>Come, sing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY PERCY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will not sing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis the next way to turn tailor, or be red-breast</LINE>
<LINE>teacher. An the indentures be drawn, I'll away</LINE>
<LINE>within these two hours; and so, come in when ye will.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLENDOWER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, come, Lord Mortimer; you are as slow</LINE>
<LINE>As hot Lord Percy is on fire to go.</LINE>
<LINE>By this our book is drawn; we'll but seal,</LINE>
<LINE>And then to horse immediately.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MORTIMER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With all my heart.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt</STAGEDIR>
</SCENE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE II.  London. The palace.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter KING HENRY IV, PRINCE HENRY, and others</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY IV</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lords, give us leave; the Prince of Wales and I</LINE>
<LINE>Must have some private conference; but be near at hand,</LINE>
<LINE>For we shall presently have need of you.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exeunt Lords</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>I know not whether God will have it so,</LINE>
<LINE>For some displeasing service I have done,</LINE>
<LINE>That, in his secret doom, out of my blood</LINE>
<LINE>He'll breed revengement and a scourge for me;</LINE>
<LINE>But thou dost in thy passages of life</LINE>
<LINE>Make me believe that thou art only mark'd</LINE>
<LINE>For the hot vengeance and the rod of heaven</LINE>
<LINE>To punish my mistreadings. Tell me else,</LINE>
<LINE>Could such inordinate and low desires,</LINE>
<LINE>Such poor, such bare, such lewd, such mean attempts,</LINE>
<LINE>Such barren pleasures, rude society,</LINE>
<LINE>As thou art match'd withal and grafted to,</LINE>
<LINE>Accompany the greatness of thy blood</LINE>
<LINE>And hold their level with thy princely heart?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So please your majesty, I would I could</LINE>
<LINE>Quit all offences with as clear excuse</LINE>
<LINE>As well as I am doubtless I can purge</LINE>
<LINE>Myself of many I am charged withal:</LINE>
<LINE>Yet such extenuation let me beg,</LINE>
<LINE>As, in reproof of many tales devised,</LINE>
<LINE>which oft the ear of greatness needs must hear,</LINE>
<LINE>By smiling pick-thanks and base news-mongers,</LINE>
<LINE>I may, for some things true, wherein my youth</LINE>
<LINE>Hath faulty wander'd and irregular,</LINE>
<LINE>Find pardon on my true submission.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY IV</SPEAKER>
<LINE>God pardon thee! yet let me wonder, Harry,</LINE>
<LINE>At thy affections, which do hold a wing</LINE>
<LINE>Quite from the flight of all thy ancestors.</LINE>
<LINE>Thy place in council thou hast rudely lost.</LINE>
<LINE>Which by thy younger brother is supplied,</LINE>
<LINE>And art almost an alien to the hearts</LINE>
<LINE>Of all the court and princes of my blood:</LINE>
<LINE>The hope and expectation of thy time</LINE>
<LINE>Is ruin'd, and the soul of every man</LINE>
<LINE>Prophetically doth forethink thy fall.</LINE>
<LINE>Had I so lavish of my presence been,</LINE>
<LINE>So common-hackney'd in the eyes of men,</LINE>
<LINE>So stale and cheap to vulgar company,</LINE>
<LINE>Opinion, that did help me to the crown,</LINE>
<LINE>Had still kept loyal to possession</LINE>
<LINE>And left me in reputeless banishment,</LINE>
<LINE>A fellow of no mark nor likelihood.</LINE>
<LINE>By being seldom seen, I could not stir</LINE>
<LINE>But like a comet I was wonder'd at;</LINE>
<LINE>That men would tell their children 'This is he;'</LINE>
<LINE>Others would say 'Where, which is Bolingbroke?'</LINE>
<LINE>And then I stole all courtesy from heaven,</LINE>
<LINE>And dress'd myself in such humility</LINE>
<LINE>That I did pluck allegiance from men's hearts,</LINE>
<LINE>Loud shouts and salutations from their mouths,</LINE>
<LINE>Even in the presence of the crowned king.</LINE>
<LINE>Thus did I keep my person fresh and new;</LINE>
<LINE>My presence, like a robe pontifical,</LINE>
<LINE>Ne'er seen but wonder'd at: and so my state,</LINE>
<LINE>Seldom but sumptuous, showed like a feast</LINE>
<LINE>And won by rareness such solemnity.</LINE>
<LINE>The skipping king, he ambled up and down</LINE>
<LINE>With shallow jesters and rash bavin wits,</LINE>
<LINE>Soon kindled and soon burnt; carded his state,</LINE>
<LINE>Mingled his royalty with capering fools,</LINE>
<LINE>Had his great name profaned with their scorns</LINE>
<LINE>And gave his countenance, against his name,</LINE>
<LINE>To laugh at gibing boys and stand the push</LINE>
<LINE>Of every beardless vain comparative,</LINE>
<LINE>Grew a companion to the common streets,</LINE>
<LINE>Enfeoff'd himself to popularity;</LINE>
<LINE>That, being daily swallow'd by men's eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>They surfeited with honey and began</LINE>
<LINE>To loathe the taste of sweetness, whereof a little</LINE>
<LINE>More than a little is by much too much.</LINE>
<LINE>So when he had occasion to be seen,</LINE>
<LINE>He was but as the cuckoo is in June,</LINE>
<LINE>Heard, not regarded; seen, but with such eyes</LINE>
<LINE>As, sick and blunted with community,</LINE>
<LINE>Afford no extraordinary gaze,</LINE>
<LINE>Such as is bent on sun-like majesty</LINE>
<LINE>When it shines seldom in admiring eyes;</LINE>
<LINE>But rather drowzed and hung their eyelids down,</LINE>
<LINE>Slept in his face and render'd such aspect</LINE>
<LINE>As cloudy men use to their adversaries,</LINE>
<LINE>Being with his presence glutted, gorged and full.</LINE>
<LINE>And in that very line, Harry, standest thou;</LINE>
<LINE>For thou has lost thy princely privilege</LINE>
<LINE>With vile participation: not an eye</LINE>
<LINE>But is a-weary of thy common sight,</LINE>
<LINE>Save mine, which hath desired to see thee more;</LINE>
<LINE>Which now doth that I would not have it do,</LINE>
<LINE>Make blind itself with foolish tenderness.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I shall hereafter, my thrice gracious lord,</LINE>
<LINE>Be more myself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY IV</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For all the world</LINE>
<LINE>As thou art to this hour was Richard then</LINE>
<LINE>When I from France set foot at Ravenspurgh,</LINE>
<LINE>And even as I was then is Percy now.</LINE>
<LINE>Now, by my sceptre and my soul to boot,</LINE>
<LINE>He hath more worthy interest to the state</LINE>
<LINE>Than thou the shadow of succession;</LINE>
<LINE>For of no right, nor colour like to right,</LINE>
<LINE>He doth fill fields with harness in the realm,</LINE>
<LINE>Turns head against the lion's armed jaws,</LINE>
<LINE>And, being no more in debt to years than thou,</LINE>
<LINE>Leads ancient lords and reverend bishops on</LINE>
<LINE>To bloody battles and to bruising arms.</LINE>
<LINE>What never-dying honour hath he got</LINE>
<LINE>Against renowned Douglas! whose high deeds,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose hot incursions and great name in arms</LINE>
<LINE>Holds from all soldiers chief majority</LINE>
<LINE>And military title capital</LINE>
<LINE>Through all the kingdoms that acknowledge Christ:</LINE>
<LINE>Thrice hath this Hotspur, Mars in swathling clothes,</LINE>
<LINE>This infant warrior, in his enterprises</LINE>
<LINE>Discomfited great Douglas, ta'en him once,</LINE>
<LINE>Enlarged him and made a friend of him,</LINE>
<LINE>To fill the mouth of deep defiance up</LINE>
<LINE>And shake the peace and safety of our throne.</LINE>
<LINE>And what say you to this? Percy, Northumberland,</LINE>
<LINE>The Archbishop's grace of York, Douglas, Mortimer,</LINE>
<LINE>Capitulate against us and are up.</LINE>
<LINE>But wherefore do I tell these news to thee?</LINE>
<LINE>Why, Harry, do I tell thee of my foes,</LINE>
<LINE>Which art my near'st and dearest enemy?</LINE>
<LINE>Thou that art like enough, through vassal fear,</LINE>
<LINE>Base inclination and the start of spleen</LINE>
<LINE>To fight against me under Percy's pay,</LINE>
<LINE>To dog his heels and curtsy at his frowns,</LINE>
<LINE>To show how much thou art degenerate.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do not think so; you shall not find it so:</LINE>
<LINE>And God forgive them that so much have sway'd</LINE>
<LINE>Your majesty's good thoughts away from me!</LINE>
<LINE>I will redeem all this on Percy's head</LINE>
<LINE>And in the closing of some glorious day</LINE>
<LINE>Be bold to tell you that I am your son;</LINE>
<LINE>When I will wear a garment all of blood</LINE>
<LINE>And stain my favours in a bloody mask,</LINE>
<LINE>Which, wash'd away, shall scour my shame with it:</LINE>
<LINE>And that shall be the day, whene'er it lights,</LINE>
<LINE>That this same child of honour and renown,</LINE>
<LINE>This gallant Hotspur, this all-praised knight,</LINE>
<LINE>And your unthought-of Harry chance to meet.</LINE>
<LINE>For every honour sitting on his helm,</LINE>
<LINE>Would they were multitudes, and on my head</LINE>
<LINE>My shames redoubled! for the time will come,</LINE>
<LINE>That I shall make this northern youth exchange</LINE>
<LINE>His glorious deeds for my indignities.</LINE>
<LINE>Percy is but my factor, good my lord,</LINE>
<LINE>To engross up glorious deeds on my behalf;</LINE>
<LINE>And I will call him to so strict account,</LINE>
<LINE>That he shall render every glory up,</LINE>
<LINE>Yea, even the slightest worship of his time,</LINE>
<LINE>Or I will tear the reckoning from his heart.</LINE>
<LINE>This, in the name of God, I promise here:</LINE>
<LINE>The which if He be pleased I shall perform,</LINE>
<LINE>I do beseech your majesty may salve</LINE>
<LINE>The long-grown wounds of my intemperance:</LINE>
<LINE>If not, the end of life cancels all bands;</LINE>
<LINE>And I will die a hundred thousand deaths</LINE>
<LINE>Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY IV</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A hundred thousand rebels die in this:</LINE>
<LINE>Thou shalt have charge and sovereign trust herein.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter BLUNT</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>How now, good Blunt? thy looks are full of speed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR WALTER BLUNT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So hath the business that I come to speak of.</LINE>
<LINE>Lord Mortimer of Scotland hath sent word</LINE>
<LINE>That Douglas and the English rebels met</LINE>
<LINE>The eleventh of this month at Shrewsbury</LINE>
<LINE>A mighty and a fearful head they are,</LINE>
<LINE>If promises be kept on every hand,</LINE>
<LINE>As ever offer'd foul play in the state.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY IV</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The Earl of Westmoreland set forth to-day;</LINE>
<LINE>With him my son, Lord John of Lancaster;</LINE>
<LINE>For this advertisement is five days old:</LINE>
<LINE>On Wednesday next, Harry, you shall set forward;</LINE>
<LINE>On Thursday we ourselves will march: our meeting</LINE>
<LINE>Is Bridgenorth: and, Harry, you shall march</LINE>
<LINE>Through Gloucestershire; by which account,</LINE>
<LINE>Our business valued, some twelve days hence</LINE>
<LINE>Our general forces at Bridgenorth shall meet.</LINE>
<LINE>Our hands are full of business: let's away;</LINE>
<LINE>Advantage feeds him fat, while men delay.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter FALSTAFF and BARDOLPH</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Bardolph, am I not fallen away vilely since this last</LINE>
<LINE>action? do I not bate? do I not dwindle? Why my</LINE>
<LINE>skin hangs about me like an like an old lady's loose</LINE>
<LINE>gown; I am withered like an old apple-john. Well,</LINE>
<LINE>I'll repent, and that suddenly, while I am in some</LINE>
<LINE>liking; I shall be out of heart shortly, and then I</LINE>
<LINE>shall have no strength to repent. An I have not</LINE>
<LINE>forgotten what the inside of a church is made of, I</LINE>
<LINE>am a peppercorn, a brewer's horse: the inside of a</LINE>
<LINE>church! Company, villanous company, hath been the</LINE>
<LINE>spoil of me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BARDOLPH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir John, you are so fretful, you cannot live long.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, there is it: come sing me a bawdy song; make</LINE>
<LINE>me merry. I was as virtuously given as a gentleman</LINE>
<LINE>need to be; virtuous enough; swore little; diced not</LINE>
<LINE>above seven times a week; went to a bawdy-house once</LINE>
<LINE>in a quarter--of an hour; paid money that I</LINE>
<LINE>borrowed, three of four times; lived well and in</LINE>
<LINE>good compass: and now I live out of all order, out</LINE>
<LINE>of all compass.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BARDOLPH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, you are so fat, Sir John, that you must needs</LINE>
<LINE>be out of all compass, out of all reasonable</LINE>
<LINE>compass, Sir John.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do thou amend thy face, and I'll amend my life:</LINE>
<LINE>thou art our admiral, thou bearest the lantern in</LINE>
<LINE>the poop, but 'tis in the nose of thee; thou art the</LINE>
<LINE>Knight of the Burning Lamp.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BARDOLPH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, Sir John, my face does you no harm.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, I'll be sworn; I make as good use of it as many</LINE>
<LINE>a man doth of a Death's-head or a memento mori: I</LINE>
<LINE>never see thy face but I think upon hell-fire and</LINE>
<LINE>Dives that lived in purple; for there he is in his</LINE>
<LINE>robes, burning, burning. If thou wert any way</LINE>
<LINE>given to virtue, I would swear by thy face; my oath</LINE>
<LINE>should be 'By this fire, that's God's angel:' but</LINE>
<LINE>thou art altogether given over; and wert indeed, but</LINE>
<LINE>for the light in thy face, the son of utter</LINE>
<LINE>darkness. When thou rannest up Gadshill in the</LINE>
<LINE>night to catch my horse, if I did not think thou</LINE>
<LINE>hadst been an ignis fatuus or a ball of wildfire,</LINE>
<LINE>there's no purchase in money. O, thou art a</LINE>
<LINE>perpetual triumph, an everlasting bonfire-light!</LINE>
<LINE>Thou hast saved me a thousand marks in links and</LINE>
<LINE>torches, walking with thee in the night betwixt</LINE>
<LINE>tavern and tavern: but the sack that thou hast</LINE>
<LINE>drunk me would have bought me lights as good cheap</LINE>
<LINE>at the dearest chandler's in Europe. I have</LINE>
<LINE>maintained that salamander of yours with fire any</LINE>
<LINE>time this two and thirty years; God reward me for</LINE>
<LINE>it!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BARDOLPH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Sblood, I would my face were in your belly!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>God-a-mercy! so should I be sure to be heart-burned.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter Hostess</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>How now, Dame Partlet the hen! have you inquired</LINE>
<LINE>yet who picked my pocket?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Hostess</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, Sir John, what do you think, Sir John? do you</LINE>
<LINE>think I keep thieves in my house? I have searched,</LINE>
<LINE>I have inquired, so has my husband, man by man, boy</LINE>
<LINE>by boy, servant by servant: the tithe of a hair</LINE>
<LINE>was never lost in my house before.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ye lie, hostess: Bardolph was shaved and lost many</LINE>
<LINE>a hair; and I'll be sworn my pocket was picked. Go</LINE>
<LINE>to, you are a woman, go.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Hostess</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who, I? no; I defy thee: God's light, I was never</LINE>
<LINE>called so in mine own house before.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go to, I know you well enough.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Hostess</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, Sir John; You do not know me, Sir John. I know</LINE>
<LINE>you, Sir John: you owe me money, Sir John; and now</LINE>
<LINE>you pick a quarrel to beguile me of it: I bought</LINE>
<LINE>you a dozen of shirts to your back.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Dowlas, filthy dowlas: I have given them away to</LINE>
<LINE>bakers' wives, and they have made bolters of them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Hostess</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, as I am a true woman, holland of eight</LINE>
<LINE>shillings an ell. You owe money here besides, Sir</LINE>
<LINE>John, for your diet and by-drinkings, and money lent</LINE>
<LINE>you, four and twenty pound.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He had his part of it; let him pay.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Hostess</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He? alas, he is poor; he hath nothing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How! poor? look upon his face; what call you rich?</LINE>
<LINE>let them coin his nose, let them coin his cheeks:</LINE>
<LINE>Ill not pay a denier. What, will you make a younker</LINE>
<LINE>of me? shall I not take mine case in mine inn but I</LINE>
<LINE>shall have my pocket picked? I have lost a</LINE>
<LINE>seal-ring of my grandfather's worth forty mark.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Hostess</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O Jesu, I have heard the prince tell him, I know not</LINE>
<LINE>how oft, that ring was copper!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How! the prince is a Jack, a sneak-cup: 'sblood, an</LINE>
<LINE>he were here, I would cudgel him like a dog, if he</LINE>
<LINE>would say so.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter PRINCE HENRY and PETO, marching, and FALSTAFF
meets them playing on his truncheon like a life</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>How now, lad! is the wind in that door, i' faith?</LINE>
<LINE>must we all march?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BARDOLPH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yea, two and two, Newgate fashion.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Hostess</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, I pray you, hear me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What sayest thou, Mistress Quickly? How doth thy</LINE>
<LINE>husband? I love him well; he is an honest man.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Hostess</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good my lord, hear me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Prithee, let her alone, and list to me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What sayest thou, Jack?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The other night I fell asleep here behind the arras</LINE>
<LINE>and had my pocket picked: this house is turned</LINE>
<LINE>bawdy-house; they pick pockets.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What didst thou lose, Jack?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Wilt thou believe me, Hal? three or four bonds of</LINE>
<LINE>forty pound apiece, and a seal-ring of my</LINE>
<LINE>grandfather's.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A trifle, some eight-penny matter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Hostess</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So I told him, my lord; and I said I heard your</LINE>
<LINE>grace say so: and, my lord, he speaks most vilely</LINE>
<LINE>of you, like a foul-mouthed man as he is; and said</LINE>
<LINE>he would cudgel you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What! he did not?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Hostess</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There's neither faith, truth, nor womanhood in me else.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There's no more faith in thee than in a stewed</LINE>
<LINE>prune; nor no more truth in thee than in a drawn</LINE>
<LINE>fox; and for womanhood, Maid Marian may be the</LINE>
<LINE>deputy's wife of the ward to thee. Go, you thing,</LINE>
<LINE>go</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Hostess</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Say, what thing? what thing?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What thing! why, a thing to thank God on.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Hostess</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am no thing to thank God on, I would thou</LINE>
<LINE>shouldst know it; I am an honest man's wife: and,</LINE>
<LINE>setting thy knighthood aside, thou art a knave to</LINE>
<LINE>call me so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Setting thy womanhood aside, thou art a beast to say</LINE>
<LINE>otherwise.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Hostess</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Say, what beast, thou knave, thou?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What beast! why, an otter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>An otter, Sir John! Why an otter?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, she's neither fish nor flesh; a man knows not</LINE>
<LINE>where to have her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Hostess</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou art an unjust man in saying so: thou or any</LINE>
<LINE>man knows where to have me, thou knave, thou!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou sayest true, hostess; and he slanders thee most grossly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Hostess</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So he doth you, my lord; and said this other day you</LINE>
<LINE>ought him a thousand pound.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sirrah, do I owe you a thousand pound?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A thousand pound, Ha! a million: thy love is worth</LINE>
<LINE>a million: thou owest me thy love.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Hostess</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, my lord, he called you Jack, and said he would</LINE>
<LINE>cudgel you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Did I, Bardolph?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BARDOLPH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Indeed, Sir John, you said so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yea, if he said my ring was copper.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I say 'tis copper: darest thou be as good as thy word now?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, Hal, thou knowest, as thou art but man, I dare:</LINE>
<LINE>but as thou art prince, I fear thee as I fear the</LINE>
<LINE>roaring of a lion's whelp.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And why not as the lion?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The king is to be feared as the lion: dost thou</LINE>
<LINE>think I'll fear thee as I fear thy father? nay, an</LINE>
<LINE>I do, I pray God my girdle break.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, if it should, how would thy guts fall about thy</LINE>
<LINE>knees! But, sirrah, there's no room for faith,</LINE>
<LINE>truth, nor honesty in this bosom of thine; it is all</LINE>
<LINE>filled up with guts and midriff. Charge an honest</LINE>
<LINE>woman with picking thy pocket! why, thou whoreson,</LINE>
<LINE>impudent, embossed rascal, if there were anything in</LINE>
<LINE>thy pocket but tavern-reckonings, memorandums of</LINE>
<LINE>bawdy-houses, and one poor penny-worth of</LINE>
<LINE>sugar-candy to make thee long-winded, if thy pocket</LINE>
<LINE>were enriched with any other injuries but these, I</LINE>
<LINE>am a villain: and yet you will stand to if; you will</LINE>
<LINE>not pocket up wrong: art thou not ashamed?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Dost thou hear, Hal? thou knowest in the state of</LINE>
<LINE>innocency Adam fell; and what should poor Jack</LINE>
<LINE>Falstaff do in the days of villany? Thou seest I</LINE>
<LINE>have more flesh than another man, and therefore more</LINE>
<LINE>frailty. You confess then, you picked my pocket?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It appears so by the story.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hostess, I forgive thee: go, make ready breakfast;</LINE>
<LINE>love thy husband, look to thy servants, cherish thy</LINE>
<LINE>guests: thou shalt find me tractable to any honest</LINE>
<LINE>reason: thou seest I am pacified still. Nay,</LINE>
<LINE>prithee, be gone.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit Hostess</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Now Hal, to the news at court: for the robbery,</LINE>
<LINE>lad, how is that answered?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, my sweet beef, I must still be good angel to</LINE>
<LINE>thee: the money is paid back again.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, I do not like that paying back; 'tis a double labour.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am good friends with my father and may do any thing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Rob me the exchequer the first thing thou doest, and</LINE>
<LINE>do it with unwashed hands too.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BARDOLPH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have procured thee, Jack, a charge of foot.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would it had been of horse. Where shall I find</LINE>
<LINE>one that can steal well? O for a fine thief, of the</LINE>
<LINE>age of two and twenty or thereabouts! I am</LINE>
<LINE>heinously unprovided. Well, God be thanked for</LINE>
<LINE>these rebels, they offend none but the virtuous: I</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exit Bardolph</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Go, Peto, to horse, to horse; for thou and I have</LINE>
<LINE>thirty miles to ride yet ere dinner time.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit Peto</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Jack, meet me to-morrow in the temple hall at two</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well said, my noble Scot: if speaking truth</LINE>
<LINE>In this fine age were not thought flattery,</LINE>
<LINE>Such attribution should the Douglas have,</LINE>
<LINE>As not a soldier of this season's stamp</LINE>
<LINE>Should go so general current through the world.</LINE>
<LINE>By God, I cannot flatter; I do defy</LINE>

<LINE>Do so, and 'tis well.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter a Messenger with letters</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>What letters hast thou there?--I can but thank you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>These letters come from your father.</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He cannot come, my lord; he is grievous sick.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Zounds! how has he the leisure to be sick</LINE>
<LINE>In such a rustling time? Who leads his power?</LINE>
<LINE>Under whose government come they along?</LINE>

<SPEAKER>EARL OF WORCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I prithee, tell me, doth he keep his bed?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He did, my lord, four days ere I set forth;</LINE>
<LINE>And at the time of my departure thence</LINE>
<LINE>He was much fear'd by his physicians.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EARL OF WORCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would the state of time had first been whole</LINE>
<LINE>Ere he by sickness had been visited:</LINE>
<LINE>His health was never better worth than now.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sick now! droop now! this sickness doth infect</LINE>
<LINE>The very life-blood of our enterprise;</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis catching hither, even to our camp.</LINE>
<LINE>He writes me here, that inward sickness--</LINE>
<LINE>And that his friends by deputation could not</LINE>
<LINE>So soon be drawn, nor did he think it meet</LINE>
<LINE>To lay so dangerous and dear a trust</LINE>
<LINE>On any soul removed but on his own.</LINE>
<LINE>Yet doth he give us bold advertisement,</LINE>
<LINE>That with our small conjunction we should on,</LINE>
<LINE>To see how fortune is disposed to us;</LINE>
<LINE>For, as he writes, there is no quailing now.</LINE>
<LINE>Because the king is certainly possess'd</LINE>
<LINE>Of all our purposes. What say you to it?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EARL OF WORCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your father's sickness is a maim to us.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A perilous gash, a very limb lopp'd off:</LINE>
<LINE>And yet, in faith, it is not; his present want</LINE>
<LINE>Seems more than we shall find it: were it good</LINE>
<LINE>To set the exact wealth of all our states</LINE>
<LINE>All at one cast? to set so rich a main</LINE>
<LINE>On the nice hazard of one doubtful hour?</LINE>
<LINE>It were not good; for therein should we read</LINE>
<LINE>The very bottom and the soul of hope,</LINE>
<LINE>The very list, the very utmost bound</LINE>
<LINE>Of all our fortunes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EARL OF DOUGLAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Faith, and so we should;</LINE>
<LINE>Where now remains a sweet reversion:</LINE>
<LINE>We may boldly spend upon the hope of what</LINE>
<LINE>Is to come in:</LINE>
<LINE>A comfort of retirement lives in this.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A rendezvous, a home to fly unto.</LINE>
<LINE>If that the devil and mischance look big</LINE>
<LINE>Upon the maidenhead of our affairs.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EARL OF WORCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But yet I would your father had been here.</LINE>
<LINE>The quality and hair of our attempt</LINE>
<LINE>Brooks no division: it will be thought</LINE>
<LINE>By some, that know not why he is away,</LINE>
<LINE>That wisdom, loyalty and mere dislike</LINE>
<LINE>Of our proceedings kept the earl from hence:</LINE>
<LINE>And think how such an apprehension</LINE>
<LINE>May turn the tide of fearful faction</LINE>
<LINE>And breed a kind of question in our cause;</LINE>
<LINE>For well you know we of the offering side</LINE>
<LINE>Must keep aloof from strict arbitrement,</LINE>
<LINE>And stop all sight-holes, every loop from whence</LINE>
<LINE>The eye of reason may pry in upon us:</LINE>
<LINE>This absence of your father's draws a curtain,</LINE>
<LINE>That shows the ignorant a kind of fear</LINE>
<LINE>Before not dreamt of.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You strain too far.</LINE>
<LINE>I rather of his absence make this use:</LINE>
<LINE>It lends a lustre and more great opinion,</LINE>
<LINE>A larger dare to our great enterprise,</LINE>
<LINE>Than if the earl were here; for men must think,</LINE>
<LINE>If we without his help can make a head</LINE>
<LINE>To push against a kingdom, with his help</LINE>
<LINE>We shall o'erturn it topsy-turvy down.</LINE>
<LINE>Yet all goes well, yet all our joints are whole.</LINE>

<LINE>Pray God my news be worth a welcome, lord.</LINE>
<LINE>The Earl of Westmoreland, seven thousand strong,</LINE>
<LINE>Is marching hitherwards; with him Prince John.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No harm: what more?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VERNON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And further, I have learn'd,</LINE>
<LINE>The king himself in person is set forth,</LINE>
<LINE>Or hitherwards intended speedily,</LINE>
<LINE>With strong and mighty preparation.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He shall be welcome too. Where is his son,</LINE>
<LINE>The nimble-footed madcap Prince of Wales,</LINE>
<LINE>And his comrades, that daff'd the world aside,</LINE>
<LINE>And bid it pass?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VERNON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>All furnish'd, all in arms;</LINE>
<LINE>All plumed like estridges that with the wind</LINE>
<LINE>Baited like eagles having lately bathed;</LINE>
<LINE>Glittering in golden coats, like images;</LINE>
<LINE>As full of spirit as the month of May,</LINE>
<LINE>And gorgeous as the sun at midsummer;</LINE>
<LINE>Wanton as youthful goats, wild as young bulls.</LINE>
<LINE>I saw young Harry, with his beaver on,</LINE>
<LINE>His cuisses on his thighs, gallantly arm'd</LINE>
<LINE>Rise from the ground like feather'd Mercury,</LINE>
<LINE>And vaulted with such ease into his seat,</LINE>
<LINE>As if an angel dropp'd down from the clouds,</LINE>
<LINE>To turn and wind a fiery Pegasus</LINE>
<LINE>And witch the world with noble horsemanship.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No more, no more: worse than the sun in March,</LINE>
<LINE>This praise doth nourish agues. Let them come:</LINE>
<LINE>They come like sacrifices in their trim,</LINE>
<LINE>And to the fire-eyed maid of smoky war</LINE>
<LINE>All hot and bleeding will we offer them:</LINE>
<LINE>The mailed Mars shall on his altar sit</LINE>
<LINE>Up to the ears in blood. I am on fire</LINE>
<LINE>To hear this rich reprisal is so nigh</LINE>
<LINE>And yet not ours. Come, let me taste my horse,</LINE>
<LINE>Who is to bear me like a thunderbolt</LINE>
<LINE>Against the bosom of the Prince of Wales:</LINE>
<LINE>Harry to Harry shall, hot horse to horse,</LINE>
<LINE>Meet and ne'er part till one drop down a corse.</LINE>
<LINE>O that Glendower were come!</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Forty let it be:</LINE>
<LINE>My father and Glendower being both away,</LINE>
<LINE>The powers of us may serve so great a day</LINE>
<LINE>Come, let us take a muster speedily:</LINE>

<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If I be not ashamed of my soldiers, I am a soused</LINE>
<LINE>gurnet. I have misused the king's press damnably.</LINE>
<LINE>I have got, in exchange of a hundred and fifty</LINE>
<LINE>soldiers, three hundred and odd pounds. I press me</LINE>
<LINE>none but good house-holders, yeoman's sons; inquire</LINE>
<LINE>me out contracted bachelors, such as had been asked</LINE>
<LINE>twice on the banns; such a commodity of warm slaves,</LINE>
<LINE>as had as lieve hear the devil as a drum; such as</LINE>
<LINE>fear the report of a caliver worse than a struck</LINE>
<LINE>fowl or a hurt wild-duck. I pressed me none but such</LINE>
<LINE>toasts-and-butter, with hearts in their bellies no</LINE>
<LINE>bigger than pins' heads, and they have bought out</LINE>
<LINE>their services; and now my whole charge consists of</LINE>
<LINE>ancients, corporals, lieutenants, gentlemen of</LINE>
<LINE>companies, slaves as ragged as Lazarus in the</LINE>
<LINE>painted cloth, where the glutton's dogs licked his</LINE>
<LINE>sores; and such as indeed were never soldiers, but</LINE>
<LINE>discarded unjust serving-men, younger sons to</LINE>
<LINE>younger brothers, revolted tapsters and ostlers</LINE>
<LINE>trade-fallen, the cankers of a calm world and a</LINE>
<LINE>long peace, ten times more dishonourable ragged than</LINE>
<LINE>an old faced ancient: and such have I, to fill up</LINE>
<LINE>the rooms of them that have bought out their</LINE>
<LINE>services, that you would think that I had a hundred</LINE>
<LINE>and fifty tattered prodigals lately come from</LINE>
<LINE>swine-keeping, from eating draff and husks. A mad</LINE>
<LINE>fellow met me on the way and told me I had unloaded</LINE>
<LINE>all the gibbets and pressed the dead bodies. No eye</LINE>
<LINE>hath seen such scarecrows. I'll not march through</LINE>
<LINE>Coventry with them, that's flat: nay, and the</LINE>
<LINE>villains march wide betwixt the legs, as if they had</LINE>
<LINE>gyves on; for indeed I had the most of them out of</LINE>
<LINE>prison. There's but a shirt and a half in all my</LINE>
<LINE>company; and the half shirt is two napkins tacked</LINE>
<LINE>together and thrown over the shoulders like an</LINE>
<LINE>herald's coat without sleeves; and the shirt, to say</LINE>
<LINE>the truth, stolen from my host at Saint Alban's, or</LINE>
<LINE>the red-nose innkeeper of Daventry. But that's all</LINE>
<LINE>one; they'll find linen enough on every hedge.</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Ay, but, Sir John, methinks they are exceeding poor</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>'Faith, for their poverty, I know not where they had</LINE>

<LINE>No I'll be sworn; unless you call three fingers on</LINE>

<LINE>I come with gracious offers from the king,</LINE>
<LINE>if you vouchsafe me hearing and respect.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Welcome, Sir Walter Blunt; and would to God</LINE>
<LINE>You were of our determination!</LINE>
<LINE>Some of us love you well; and even those some</LINE>
<LINE>Envy your great deservings and good name,</LINE>
<LINE>Because you are not of our quality,</LINE>
<LINE>But stand against us like an enemy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR WALTER BLUNT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And God defend but still I should stand so,</LINE>
<LINE>So long as out of limit and true rule</LINE>
<LINE>You stand against anointed majesty.</LINE>
<LINE>But to my charge. The king hath sent to know</LINE>
<LINE>The nature of your griefs, and whereupon</LINE>
<LINE>You conjure from the breast of civil peace</LINE>
<LINE>Such bold hostility, teaching his duteous land</LINE>
<LINE>Audacious cruelty. If that the king</LINE>
<LINE>Have any way your good deserts forgot,</LINE>
<LINE>Which he confesseth to be manifold,</LINE>
<LINE>He bids you name your griefs; and with all speed</LINE>
<LINE>You shall have your desires with interest</LINE>
<LINE>And pardon absolute for yourself and these</LINE>
<LINE>Herein misled by your suggestion.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The king is kind; and well we know the king</LINE>
<LINE>Knows at what time to promise, when to pay.</LINE>
<LINE>My father and my uncle and myself</LINE>
<LINE>Did give him that same royalty he wears;</LINE>
<LINE>And when he was not six and twenty strong,</LINE>
<LINE>Sick in the world's regard, wretched and low,</LINE>
<LINE>A poor unminded outlaw sneaking home,</LINE>
<LINE>My father gave him welcome to the shore;</LINE>
<LINE>And when he heard him swear and vow to God</LINE>
<LINE>He came but to be Duke of Lancaster,</LINE>
<LINE>To sue his livery and beg his peace,</LINE>
<LINE>With tears of innocency and terms of zeal,</LINE>
<LINE>My father, in kind heart and pity moved,</LINE>
<LINE>Swore him assistance and perform'd it too.</LINE>
<LINE>Now when the lords and barons of the realm</LINE>
<LINE>Perceived Northumberland did lean to him,</LINE>
<LINE>The more and less came in with cap and knee;</LINE>
<LINE>Met him in boroughs, cities, villages,</LINE>
<LINE>Attended him on bridges, stood in lanes,</LINE>
<LINE>Laid gifts before him, proffer'd him their oaths,</LINE>
<LINE>Gave him their heirs, as pages follow'd him</LINE>
<LINE>Even at the heels in golden multitudes.</LINE>
<LINE>He presently, as greatness knows itself,</LINE>
<LINE>Steps me a little higher than his vow</LINE>
<LINE>Made to my father, while his blood was poor,</LINE>
<LINE>Upon the naked shore at Ravenspurgh;</LINE>
<LINE>And now, forsooth, takes on him to reform</LINE>
<LINE>Some certain edicts and some strait decrees</LINE>
<LINE>That lie too heavy on the commonwealth,</LINE>
<LINE>Cries out upon abuses, seems to weep</LINE>
<LINE>Over his country's wrongs; and by this face,</LINE>
<LINE>This seeming brow of justice, did he win</LINE>
<LINE>The hearts of all that he did angle for;</LINE>
<LINE>Proceeded further; cut me off the heads</LINE>
<LINE>Of all the favourites that the absent king</LINE>
<LINE>In deputation left behind him here,</LINE>
<LINE>When he was personal in the Irish war.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR WALTER BLUNT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tut, I came not to hear this.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then to the point.</LINE>
<LINE>In short time after, he deposed the king;</LINE>
<LINE>Soon after that, deprived him of his life;</LINE>
<LINE>And in the neck of that, task'd the whole state:</LINE>
<LINE>To make that worse, suffer'd his kinsman March,</LINE>
<LINE>Who is, if every owner were well placed,</LINE>
<LINE>Indeed his king, to be engaged in Wales,</LINE>
<LINE>There without ransom to lie forfeited;</LINE>
<LINE>Disgraced me in my happy victories,</LINE>
<LINE>Sought to entrap me by intelligence;</LINE>
<LINE>Rated mine uncle from the council-board;</LINE>
<LINE>In rage dismiss'd my father from the court;</LINE>
<LINE>Broke oath on oath, committed wrong on wrong,</LINE>
<LINE>And in conclusion drove us to seek out</LINE>
<LINE>This head of safety; and withal to pry</LINE>
<LINE>Into his title, the which we find</LINE>
<LINE>Too indirect for long continuance.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR WALTER BLUNT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Shall I return this answer to the king?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not so, Sir Walter: we'll withdraw awhile.</LINE>
<LINE>Go to the king; and let there be impawn'd</LINE>
<LINE>Some surety for a safe return again,</LINE>
<LINE>And in the morning early shall my uncle</LINE>
<LINE>Bring him our purposes: and so farewell.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR WALTER BLUNT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would you would accept of grace and love.</LINE>

<LINE>Like enough you do.</LINE>
<LINE>To-morrow, good Sir Michael, is a day</LINE>
<LINE>Wherein the fortune of ten thousand men</LINE>
<LINE>Must bide the touch; for, sir, at Shrewsbury,</LINE>
<LINE>As I am truly given to understand,</LINE>
<LINE>The king with mighty and quick-raised power</LINE>
<LINE>Meets with Lord Harry: and, I fear, Sir Michael,</LINE>
<LINE>What with the sickness of Northumberland,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose power was in the first proportion,</LINE>
<LINE>And what with Owen Glendower's absence thence,</LINE>
<LINE>Who with them was a rated sinew too</LINE>
<LINE>And comes not in, o'er-ruled by prophecies,</LINE>
<LINE>I fear the power of Percy is too weak</LINE>
<LINE>To wage an instant trial with the king.</LINE>

<LINE>Why, my good lord, you need not fear;</LINE>
<LINE>There is Douglas and Lord Mortimer.</LINE>

<LINE>No, Mortimer is not there.</LINE>

<LINE>The noble Westmoreland and warlike Blunt;</LINE>
<LINE>And moe corrivals and dear men</LINE>

<LINE>Doubt not, my lord, they shall be well opposed.</LINE>

<LINE>I hope no less, yet needful 'tis to fear;</LINE>
<LINE>And, to prevent the worst, Sir Michael, speed:</LINE>
<LINE>For if Lord Percy thrive not, ere the king</LINE>
<LINE>Dismiss his power, he means to visit us,</LINE>
<LINE>For he hath heard of our confederacy,</LINE>

<LINE>That you did nothing purpose 'gainst the state;</LINE>
<LINE>Nor claim no further than your new-fall'n right,</LINE>
<LINE>The seat of Gaunt, dukedom of Lancaster:</LINE>
<LINE>To this we swore our aid. But in short space</LINE>
<LINE>It rain'd down fortune showering on your head;</LINE>
<LINE>And such a flood of greatness fell on you,</LINE>
<LINE>What with our help, what with the absent king,</LINE>
<LINE>What with the injuries of a wanton time,</LINE>
<LINE>The seeming sufferances that you had borne,</LINE>
<LINE>And the contrarious winds that held the king</LINE>
<LINE>So long in his unlucky Irish wars</LINE>
<LINE>That all in England did repute him dead:</LINE>
<LINE>And from this swarm of fair advantages</LINE>
<LINE>You took occasion to be quickly woo'd</LINE>
<LINE>To gripe the general sway into your hand;</LINE>
<LINE>Forget your oath to us at Doncaster;</LINE>
<LINE>And being fed by us you used us so</LINE>
<LINE>As that ungentle hull, the cuckoo's bird,</LINE>
<LINE>Useth the sparrow; did oppress our nest;</LINE>
<LINE>Grew by our feeding to so great a bulk</LINE>
<LINE>That even our love durst not come near your sight</LINE>
<LINE>For fear of swallowing; but with nimble wing</LINE>
<LINE>We were enforced, for safety sake, to fly</LINE>
<LINE>Out of sight and raise this present head;</LINE>
<LINE>Whereby we stand opposed by such means</LINE>
<LINE>As you yourself have forged against yourself</LINE>
<LINE>By unkind usage, dangerous countenance,</LINE>
<LINE>And violation of all faith and troth</LINE>
<LINE>Sworn to us in your younger enterprise.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY IV</SPEAKER>
<LINE>These things indeed you have articulate,</LINE>
<LINE>Proclaim'd at market-crosses, read in churches,</LINE>
<LINE>To face the garment of rebellion</LINE>
<LINE>With some fine colour that may please the eye</LINE>
<LINE>Of fickle changelings and poor discontents,</LINE>
<LINE>Which gape and rub the elbow at the news</LINE>
<LINE>Of hurlyburly innovation:</LINE>
<LINE>And never yet did insurrection want</LINE>
<LINE>Such water-colours to impaint his cause;</LINE>
<LINE>Nor moody beggars, starving for a time</LINE>
<LINE>Of pellmell havoc and confusion.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In both your armies there is many a soul</LINE>
<LINE>Shall pay full dearly for this encounter,</LINE>
<LINE>If once they join in trial. Tell your nephew,</LINE>
<LINE>The Prince of Wales doth join with all the world</LINE>
<LINE>In praise of Henry Percy: by my hopes,</LINE>
<LINE>This present enterprise set off his head,</LINE>
<LINE>I do not think a braver gentleman,</LINE>
<LINE>More active-valiant or more valiant-young,</LINE>
<LINE>More daring or more bold, is now alive</LINE>
<LINE>To grace this latter age with noble deeds.</LINE>
<LINE>For my part, I may speak it to my shame,</LINE>
<LINE>I have a truant been to chivalry;</LINE>
<LINE>And so I hear he doth account me too;</LINE>
<LINE>Yet this before my father's majesty--</LINE>
<LINE>I am content that he shall take the odds</LINE>
<LINE>Of his great name and estimation,</LINE>
<LINE>And will, to save the blood on either side,</LINE>
<LINE>Try fortune with him in a single fight.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY IV</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And, Prince of Wales, so dare we venture thee,</LINE>
<LINE>Albeit considerations infinite</LINE>
<LINE>Do make against it. No, good Worcester, no,</LINE>
<LINE>We love our people well; even those we love</LINE>
<LINE>That are misled upon your cousin's part;</LINE>
<LINE>And, will they take the offer of our grace,</LINE>
<LINE>Both he and they and you, every man</LINE>
<LINE>Shall be my friend again and I'll be his:</LINE>
<LINE>So tell your cousin, and bring me word</LINE>
<LINE>What he will do: but if he will not yield,</LINE>
<LINE>Rebuke and dread correction wait on us</LINE>
<LINE>And they shall do their office. So, be gone;</LINE>
<LINE>We will not now be troubled with reply:</LINE>
<LINE>We offer fair; take it advisedly.</LINE>

<LINE>'Tis not due yet; I would be loath to pay him before</LINE>

<LINE>me on. Yea, but how if honour prick me off when I</LINE>
<LINE>come on? how then? Can honour set to a leg? no: or</LINE>
<LINE>an arm? no: or take away the grief of a wound? no.</LINE>
<LINE>Honour hath no skill in surgery, then? no. What is</LINE>
<LINE>honour? a word. What is in that word honour? what</LINE>
<LINE>is that honour? air. A trim reckoning! Who hath it?</LINE>
<LINE>he that died o' Wednesday. Doth he feel it? no.</LINE>
<LINE>Doth he hear it? no. 'Tis insensible, then. Yea,</LINE>
<LINE>to the dead. But will it not live with the living?</LINE>
<LINE>no. Why? detraction will not suffer it. Therefore</LINE>
<LINE>I'll none of it. Honour is a mere scutcheon: and so</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VERNON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Twere best he did.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EARL OF WORCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then are we all undone.</LINE>
<LINE>It is not possible, it cannot be,</LINE>
<LINE>The king should keep his word in loving us;</LINE>
<LINE>He will suspect us still and find a time</LINE>
<LINE>To punish this offence in other faults:</LINE>
<LINE>Suspicion all our lives shall be stuck full of eyes;</LINE>
<LINE>For treason is but trusted like the fox,</LINE>
<LINE>Who, ne'er so tame, so cherish'd and lock'd up,</LINE>
<LINE>Will have a wild trick of his ancestors.</LINE>
<LINE>Look how we can, or sad or merrily,</LINE>
<LINE>Interpretation will misquote our looks,</LINE>
<LINE>And we shall feed like oxen at a stall,</LINE>
<LINE>The better cherish'd, still the nearer death.</LINE>
<LINE>My nephew's trespass may be well forgot;</LINE>
<LINE>it hath the excuse of youth and heat of blood,</LINE>
<LINE>And an adopted name of privilege,</LINE>
<LINE>A hair-brain'd Hotspur, govern'd by a spleen:</LINE>
<LINE>All his offences live upon my head</LINE>
<LINE>And on his father's; we did train him on,</LINE>
<LINE>And, his corruption being ta'en from us,</LINE>
<LINE>We, as the spring of all, shall pay for all.</LINE>

<LINE>No, by my soul; I never in my life</LINE>
<LINE>Did hear a challenge urged more modestly,</LINE>
<LINE>Unless a brother should a brother dare</LINE>
<LINE>To gentle exercise and proof of arms.</LINE>

<LINE>Spoke to your deservings like a chronicle,</LINE>

<LINE>As if he master'd there a double spirit.</LINE>
<LINE>Of teaching and of learning instantly.</LINE>
<LINE>There did he pause: but let me tell the world,</LINE>

<LINE>for you! here's no vanity! I am as hot as moulten</LINE>
<LINE>lead, and as heavy too: God keep lead out of me! I</LINE>
<LINE>need no more weight than mine own bowels. I have</LINE>
<LINE>led my ragamuffins where they are peppered: there's</LINE>

<LINE>O Hal, I prithee, give me leave to breathe awhile.</LINE>

<LINE>Why, then I see</LINE>
<LINE>A very valiant rebel of the name.</LINE>
<LINE>I am the Prince of Wales; and think not, Percy,</LINE>
<LINE>To share with me in glory any more:</LINE>
<LINE>Two stars keep not their motion in one sphere;</LINE>
<LINE>Nor can one England brook a double reign,</LINE>
<LINE>Of Harry Percy and the Prince of Wales.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nor shall it, Harry; for the hour is come</LINE>
<LINE>To end the one of us; and would to God</LINE>
<LINE>Thy name in arms were now as great as mine!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll make it greater ere I part from thee;</LINE>
<LINE>And all the budding honours on thy crest</LINE>
<LINE>I'll crop, to make a garland for my head.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I can no longer brook thy vanities.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>They fight</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>Enter FALSTAFF</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well said, Hal! to it Hal! Nay, you shall find no</LINE>
<LINE>boy's play here, I can tell you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Re-enter DOUGLAS; he fights with FALSTAFF,
who falls down as if he were dead, and exit
DOUGLAS. HOTSPUR is wounded, and falls</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOTSPUR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, Harry, thou hast robb'd me of my youth!</LINE>
<LINE>I better brook the loss of brittle life</LINE>
<LINE>Than those proud titles thou hast won of me;</LINE>
<LINE>They wound my thoughts worse than sword my flesh:</LINE>
<LINE>But thought's the slave of life, and life time's fool;</LINE>
<LINE>And time, that takes survey of all the world,</LINE>
<LINE>Must have a stop. O, I could prophesy,</LINE>
<LINE>But that the earthy and cold hand of death</LINE>
<LINE>Lies on my tongue: no, Percy, thou art dust</LINE>
<LINE>And food for--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Dies</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For worms, brave Percy: fare thee well, great heart!</LINE>
<LINE>Ill-weaved ambition, how much art thou shrunk!</LINE>
<LINE>When that this body did contain a spirit,</LINE>
<LINE>A kingdom for it was too small a bound;</LINE>
<LINE>But now two paces of the vilest earth</LINE>
<LINE>Is room enough: this earth that bears thee dead</LINE>
<LINE>Bears not alive so stout a gentleman.</LINE>
<LINE>If thou wert sensible of courtesy,</LINE>
<LINE>I should not make so dear a show of zeal:</LINE>
<LINE>But let my favours hide thy mangled face;</LINE>
<LINE>And, even in thy behalf, I'll thank myself</LINE>
<LINE>For doing these fair rites of tenderness.</LINE>
<LINE>Adieu, and take thy praise with thee to heaven!</LINE>
<LINE>Thy ignominy sleep with thee in the grave,</LINE>
<LINE>But not remember'd in thy epitaph!</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>He spieth FALSTAFF on the ground</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>What, old acquaintance! could not all this flesh</LINE>
<LINE>Keep in a little life? Poor Jack, farewell!</LINE>
<LINE>I could have better spared a better man:</LINE>
<LINE>O, I should have a heavy miss of thee,</LINE>
<LINE>If I were much in love with vanity!</LINE>
<LINE>Death hath not struck so fat a deer to-day,</LINE>
<LINE>Though many dearer, in this bloody fray.</LINE>
<LINE>Embowell'd will I see thee by and by:</LINE>
<LINE>Till then in blood by noble Percy lie.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit PRINCE HENRY</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Rising up</STAGEDIR>  Embowelled! if thou embowel me to-day,</LINE>
<LINE>I'll give you leave to powder me and eat me too</LINE>
<LINE>to-morrow. 'Sblood,'twas time to counterfeit, or</LINE>
<LINE>that hot termagant Scot had paid me scot and lot too.</LINE>
<LINE>Counterfeit? I lie, I am no counterfeit: to die,</LINE>
<LINE>is to be a counterfeit; for he is but the</LINE>
<LINE>counterfeit of a man who hath not the life of a man:</LINE>
<LINE>but to counterfeit dying, when a man thereby</LINE>
<LINE>liveth, is to be no counterfeit, but the true and</LINE>
<LINE>perfect image of life indeed. The better part of</LINE>
<LINE>valour is discretion; in the which better part I</LINE>
<LINE>have saved my life.'Zounds, I am afraid of this</LINE>
<LINE>gunpowder Percy, though he be dead: how, if he</LINE>
<LINE>should counterfeit too and rise? by my faith, I am</LINE>
<LINE>afraid he would prove the better counterfeit.</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore I'll make him sure; yea, and I'll swear I</LINE>
<LINE>killed him. Why may not he rise as well as I?</LINE>
<LINE>Nothing confutes me but eyes, and nobody sees me.</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore, sirrah,</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Stabbing him</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>with a new wound in your thigh, come you along with me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Takes up HOTSPUR on his back</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>Re-enter PRINCE HENRY and LORD JOHN OF LANCASTER</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, brother John; full bravely hast thou flesh'd</LINE>
<LINE>Thy maiden sword.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LANCASTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But, soft! whom have we here?</LINE>
<LINE>Did you not tell me this fat man was dead?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I did; I saw him dead,</LINE>
<LINE>Breathless and bleeding on the ground. Art</LINE>
<LINE>thou alive?</LINE>
<LINE>Or is it fantasy that plays upon our eyesight?</LINE>
<LINE>I prithee, speak; we will not trust our eyes</LINE>
<LINE>Without our ears: thou art not what thou seem'st.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, that's certain; I am not a double man: but if I</LINE>
<LINE>be not Jack Falstaff, then am I a Jack. There is Percy:</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Throwing the body down</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>if your father will do me any honour, so; if not, let</LINE>
<LINE>him kill the next Percy himself. I look to be either</LINE>
<LINE>earl or duke, I can assure you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, Percy I killed myself and saw thee dead.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Didst thou? Lord, Lord, how this world is given to</LINE>
<LINE>lying! I grant you I was down and out of breath;</LINE>
<LINE>and so was he: but we rose both at an instant and</LINE>
<LINE>fought a long hour by Shrewsbury clock. If I may be</LINE>
<LINE>believed, so; if not, let them that should reward</LINE>
<LINE>valour bear the sin upon their own heads. I'll take</LINE>
<LINE>it upon my death, I gave him this wound in the</LINE>
<LINE>thigh: if the man were alive and would deny it,</LINE>
<LINE>'zounds, I would make him eat a piece of my sword.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LANCASTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is the strangest tale that ever I heard.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is the strangest fellow, brother John.</LINE>
<LINE>Come, bring your luggage nobly on your back:</LINE>
<LINE>For my part, if a lie may do thee grace,</LINE>
<LINE>I'll gild it with the happiest terms I have.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>A retreat is sounded</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>The trumpet sounds retreat; the day is ours.</LINE>
<LINE>Come, brother, let us to the highest of the field,</LINE>
<LINE>To see what friends are living, who are dead.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt PRINCE HENRY and LANCASTER</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll follow, as they say, for reward. He that</LINE>
<LINE>rewards me, God reward him! If I do grow great,</LINE>
<LINE>I'll grow less; for I'll purge, and leave sack, and</LINE>
<LINE>live cleanly as a nobleman should do.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>
</SCENE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE V.  Another part of the field.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>The trumpets sound. Enter KING HENRY IV, PRINCE
HENRY, LORD JOHN LANCASTER, EARL OF WESTMORELAND,
with WORCESTER and VERNON prisoners</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY IV</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thus ever did rebellion find rebuke.</LINE>
<LINE>Ill-spirited Worcester! did not we send grace,</LINE>
<LINE>Pardon and terms of love to all of you?</LINE>
<LINE>And wouldst thou turn our offers contrary?</LINE>
<LINE>Misuse the tenor of thy kinsman's trust?</LINE>
<LINE>Three knights upon our party slain to-day,</LINE>
<LINE>A noble earl and many a creature else</LINE>
<LINE>Had been alive this hour,</LINE>
<LINE>If like a Christian thou hadst truly borne</LINE>
<LINE>Betwixt our armies true intelligence.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EARL OF WORCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What I have done my safety urged me to;</LINE>
<LINE>And I embrace this fortune patiently,</LINE>
<LINE>Since not to be avoided it falls on me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY IV</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Bear Worcester to the death and Vernon too:</LINE>
<LINE>Other offenders we will pause upon.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exeunt WORCESTER and VERNON, guarded</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>How goes the field?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The noble Scot, Lord Douglas, when he saw</LINE>
<LINE>The fortune of the day quite turn'd from him,</LINE>
<LINE>The noble Percy slain, and all his men</LINE>
<LINE>Upon the foot of fear, fled with the rest;</LINE>
<LINE>And falling from a hill, he was so bruised</LINE>
<LINE>That the pursuers took him. At my tent</LINE>
<LINE>The Douglas is; and I beseech your grace</LINE>
<LINE>I may dispose of him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY IV</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With all my heart.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE HENRY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then, brother John of Lancaster, to you</LINE>
<LINE>This honourable bounty shall belong:</LINE>
<LINE>Go to the Douglas, and deliver him</LINE>
<LINE>Up to his pleasure, ransomless and free:</LINE>
<LINE>His valour shown upon our crests to-day</LINE>
<LINE>Hath taught us how to cherish such high deeds</LINE>
<LINE>Even in the bosom of our adversaries.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LANCASTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I thank your grace for this high courtesy,</LINE>
<LINE>Which I shall give away immediately.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY IV</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then this remains, that we divide our power.</LINE>
<LINE>You, son John, and my cousin Westmoreland</LINE>
<LINE>Towards York shall bend you with your dearest speed,</LINE>
<LINE>To meet Northumberland and the prelate Scroop,</LINE>
<LINE>Who, as we hear, are busily in arms:</LINE>
<LINE>Myself and you, son Harry, will towards Wales,</LINE>
<LINE>To fight with Glendower and the Earl of March.</LINE>
<LINE>Rebellion in this land shall lose his sway,</LINE>
<LINE>Meeting the cheque of such another day:</LINE>
<LINE>And since this business so fair is done,</LINE>
<LINE>Let us not leave till all our own be won.</LINE>
