<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEDFORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hung be the heavens with black, yield day to night!</LINE>
<LINE>Comets, importing change of times and states,</LINE>
<LINE>Brandish your crystal tresses in the sky,</LINE>
<LINE>And with them scourge the bad revolting stars</LINE>
<LINE>That have consented unto Henry's death!</LINE>
<LINE>King Henry the Fifth, too famous to live long!</LINE>
<LINE>England ne'er lost a king of so much worth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>England ne'er had a king until his time.</LINE>
<LINE>Virtue he had, deserving to command:</LINE>
<LINE>His brandish'd sword did blind men with his beams:</LINE>
<LINE>His arms spread wider than a dragon's wings;</LINE>
<LINE>His sparking eyes, replete with wrathful fire,</LINE>
<LINE>More dazzled and drove back his enemies</LINE>
<LINE>Than mid-day sun fierce bent against their faces.</LINE>
<LINE>What should I say? his deeds exceed all speech:</LINE>
<LINE>He ne'er lift up his hand but conquered.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EXETER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We mourn in black: why mourn we not in blood?</LINE>
<LINE>Henry is dead and never shall revive:</LINE>
<LINE>Upon a wooden coffin we attend,</LINE>
<LINE>And death's dishonourable victory</LINE>
<LINE>We with our stately presence glorify,</LINE>
<LINE>Like captives bound to a triumphant car.</LINE>
<LINE>What! shall we curse the planets of mishap</LINE>
<LINE>That plotted thus our glory's overthrow?</LINE>
<LINE>Or shall we think the subtle-witted French</LINE>
<LINE>Conjurers and sorcerers, that afraid of him</LINE>
<LINE>By magic verses have contrived his end?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BISHOP OF WINCHESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He was a king bless'd of the King of kings.</LINE>
<LINE>Unto the French the dreadful judgement-day</LINE>
<LINE>So dreadful will not be as was his sight.</LINE>
<LINE>The battles of the Lord of hosts he fought:</LINE>
<LINE>The church's prayers made him so prosperous.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The church! where is it? Had not churchmen pray'd,</LINE>
<LINE>His thread of life had not so soon decay'd:</LINE>
<LINE>None do you like but an effeminate prince,</LINE>
<LINE>Whom, like a school-boy, you may over-awe.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BISHOP OF WINCHESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Gloucester, whate'er we like, thou art protector</LINE>
<LINE>And lookest to command the prince and realm.</LINE>
<LINE>Thy wife is proud; she holdeth thee in awe,</LINE>
<LINE>More than God or religious churchmen may.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Name not religion, for thou lovest the flesh,</LINE>
<LINE>And ne'er throughout the year to church thou go'st</LINE>
<LINE>Except it be to pray against thy foes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEDFORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Cease, cease these jars and rest your minds in peace:</LINE>
<LINE>Let's to the altar: heralds, wait on us:</LINE>
<LINE>Instead of gold, we'll offer up our arms:</LINE>
<LINE>Since arms avail not now that Henry's dead.</LINE>
<LINE>Posterity, await for wretched years,</LINE>
<LINE>When at their mothers' moist eyes babes shall suck,</LINE>
<LINE>Our isle be made a nourish of salt tears,</LINE>
<LINE>And none but women left to wail the dead.</LINE>
<LINE>Henry the Fifth, thy ghost I invocate:</LINE>
<LINE>Prosper this realm, keep it from civil broils,</LINE>
<LINE>Combat with adverse planets in the heavens!</LINE>
<LINE>A far more glorious star thy soul will make</LINE>
<LINE>Than Julius Caesar or bright--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter a Messenger</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My honourable lords, health to you all!</LINE>
<LINE>Sad tidings bring I to you out of France,</LINE>
<LINE>Of loss, of slaughter and discomfiture:</LINE>
<LINE>Guienne, Champagne, Rheims, Orleans,</LINE>
<LINE>Paris, Guysors, Poictiers, are all quite lost.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEDFORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What say'st thou, man, before dead Henry's corse?</LINE>
<LINE>Speak softly, or the loss of those great towns</LINE>
<LINE>Will make him burst his lead and rise from death.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is Paris lost? is Rouen yielded up?</LINE>
<LINE>If Henry were recall'd to life again,</LINE>
<LINE>These news would cause him once more yield the ghost.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EXETER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How were they lost? what treachery was used?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No treachery; but want of men and money.</LINE>
<LINE>Amongst the soldiers this is muttered,</LINE>
<LINE>That here you maintain several factions,</LINE>
<LINE>And whilst a field should be dispatch'd and fought,</LINE>
<LINE>You are disputing of your generals:</LINE>
<LINE>One would have lingering wars with little cost;</LINE>
<LINE>Another would fly swift, but wanteth wings;</LINE>
<LINE>A third thinks, without expense at all,</LINE>
<LINE>By guileful fair words peace may be obtain'd.</LINE>
<LINE>Awake, awake, English nobility!</LINE>
<LINE>Let not sloth dim your horrors new-begot:</LINE>
<LINE>Cropp'd are the flower-de-luces in your arms;</LINE>
<LINE>Of England's coat one half is cut away.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EXETER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Were our tears wanting to this funeral,</LINE>
<LINE>These tidings would call forth their flowing tides.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEDFORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Me they concern; Regent I am of France.</LINE>
<LINE>Give me my steeled coat. I'll fight for France.</LINE>
<LINE>Away with these disgraceful wailing robes!</LINE>
<LINE>Wounds will I lend the French instead of eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>To weep their intermissive miseries.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter to them another Messenger</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lords, view these letters full of bad mischance.</LINE>
<LINE>France is revolted from the English quite,</LINE>
<LINE>Except some petty towns of no import:</LINE>
<LINE>The Dauphin Charles is crowned king of Rheims;</LINE>
<LINE>The Bastard of Orleans with him is join'd;</LINE>
<LINE>Reignier, Duke of Anjou, doth take his part;</LINE>
<LINE>The Duke of Alencon flieth to his side.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EXETER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The Dauphin crowned king! all fly to him!</LINE>
<LINE>O, whither shall we fly from this reproach?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We will not fly, but to our enemies' throats.</LINE>
<LINE>Bedford, if thou be slack, I'll fight it out.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEDFORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Gloucester, why doubt'st thou of my forwardness?</LINE>
<LINE>An army have I muster'd in my thoughts,</LINE>
<LINE>Wherewith already France is overrun.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter another Messenger</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My gracious lords, to add to your laments,</LINE>
<LINE>Wherewith you now bedew King Henry's hearse,</LINE>
<LINE>I must inform you of a dismal fight</LINE>
<LINE>Betwixt the stout Lord Talbot and the French.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BISHOP OF WINCHESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What! wherein Talbot overcame? is't so?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, no; wherein Lord Talbot was o'erthrown:</LINE>
<LINE>The circumstance I'll tell you more at large.</LINE>
<LINE>The tenth of August last this dreadful lord,</LINE>
<LINE>Retiring from the siege of Orleans,</LINE>
<LINE>Having full scarce six thousand in his troop.</LINE>
<LINE>By three and twenty thousand of the French</LINE>
<LINE>Was round encompassed and set upon.</LINE>
<LINE>No leisure had he to enrank his men;</LINE>
<LINE>He wanted pikes to set before his archers;</LINE>
<LINE>Instead whereof sharp stakes pluck'd out of hedges</LINE>
<LINE>They pitched in the ground confusedly,</LINE>
<LINE>To keep the horsemen off from breaking in.</LINE>
<LINE>More than three hours the fight continued;</LINE>
<LINE>Where valiant Talbot above human thought</LINE>
<LINE>Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:</LINE>
<LINE>Hundreds he sent to hell, and none durst stand him;</LINE>
<LINE>Here, there, and every where, enraged he flew:</LINE>
<LINE>The French exclaim'd, the devil was in arms;</LINE>
<LINE>All the whole army stood agazed on him:</LINE>
<LINE>His soldiers spying his undaunted spirit</LINE>
<LINE>A Talbot! a Talbot! cried out amain</LINE>
<LINE>And rush'd into the bowels of the battle.</LINE>
<LINE>Here had the conquest fully been seal'd up,</LINE>
<LINE>If Sir John Fastolfe had not play'd the coward:</LINE>
<LINE>He, being in the vaward, placed behind</LINE>
<LINE>With purpose to relieve and follow them,</LINE>
<LINE>Cowardly fled, not having struck one stroke.</LINE>
<LINE>Hence grew the general wreck and massacre;</LINE>
<LINE>Enclosed were they with their enemies:</LINE>
<LINE>A base Walloon, to win the Dauphin's grace,</LINE>
<LINE>Thrust Talbot with a spear into the back,</LINE>
<LINE>Whom all France with their chief assembled strength</LINE>
<LINE>Durst not presume to look once in the face.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEDFORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is Talbot slain? then I will slay myself,</LINE>
<LINE>For living idly here in pomp and ease,</LINE>
<LINE>Whilst such a worthy leader, wanting aid,</LINE>
<LINE>Unto his dastard foemen is betray'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O no, he lives; but is took prisoner,</LINE>
<LINE>And Lord Scales with him and Lord Hungerford:</LINE>
<LINE>Most of the rest slaughter'd or took likewise.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEDFORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>His ransom there is none but I shall pay:</LINE>
<LINE>I'll hale the Dauphin headlong from his throne:</LINE>
<LINE>His crown shall be the ransom of my friend;</LINE>
<LINE>Four of their lords I'll change for one of ours.</LINE>
<LINE>Farewell, my masters; to my task will I;</LINE>
<LINE>Bonfires in France forthwith I am to make,</LINE>
<LINE>To keep our great Saint George's feast withal:</LINE>
<LINE>Ten thousand soldiers with me I will take,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose bloody deeds shall make all Europe quake.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So you had need; for Orleans is besieged;</LINE>
<LINE>The English army is grown weak and faint:</LINE>
<LINE>The Earl of Salisbury craveth supply,</LINE>
<LINE>And hardly keeps his men from mutiny,</LINE>
<LINE>Since they, so few, watch such a multitude.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EXETER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Remember, lords, your oaths to Henry sworn,</LINE>
<LINE>Either to quell the Dauphin utterly,</LINE>
<LINE>Or bring him in obedience to your yoke.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEDFORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do remember it; and here take my leave,</LINE>
<LINE>To go about my preparation.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll to the Tower with all the haste I can,</LINE>
<LINE>To view the artillery and munition;</LINE>
<LINE>And then I will proclaim young Henry king.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EXETER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To Eltham will I, where the young king is,</LINE>
<LINE>Being ordain'd his special governor,</LINE>
<LINE>And for his safety there I'll best devise.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BISHOP OF WINCHESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Each hath his place and function to attend:</LINE>
<LINE>I am left out; for me nothing remains.</LINE>
<LINE>But long I will not be Jack out of office:</LINE>
<LINE>The king from Eltham I intend to steal</LINE>
<LINE>And sit at chiefest stern of public weal.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt</STAGEDIR>
</SCENE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE II.  France. Before Orleans.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Sound a flourish. Enter CHARLES, ALENCON, and
REIGNIER, marching with drum and Soldiers</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Mars his true moving, even as in the heavens</LINE>
<LINE>So in the earth, to this day is not known:</LINE>
<LINE>Late did he shine upon the English side;</LINE>
<LINE>Now we are victors; upon us he smiles.</LINE>
<LINE>What towns of any moment but we have?</LINE>
<LINE>At pleasure here we lie near Orleans;</LINE>
<LINE>Otherwhiles the famish'd English, like pale ghosts,</LINE>
<LINE>Faintly besiege us one hour in a month.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALENCON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They want their porridge and their fat bull-beeves:</LINE>
<LINE>Either they must be dieted like mules</LINE>
<LINE>And have their provender tied to their mouths</LINE>
<LINE>Or piteous they will look, like drowned mice.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REIGNIER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let's raise the siege: why live we idly here?</LINE>
<LINE>Talbot is taken, whom we wont to fear:</LINE>
<LINE>Remaineth none but mad-brain'd Salisbury;</LINE>
<LINE>And he may well in fretting spend his gall,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor men nor money hath he to make war.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sound, sound alarum! we will rush on them.</LINE>
<LINE>Now for the honour of the forlorn French!</LINE>
<LINE>Him I forgive my death that killeth me</LINE>
<LINE>When he sees me go back one foot or fly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>Here alarum; they are beaten back by the English
with great loss. Re-enter CHARLES, ALENCON, and REIGNIER</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who ever saw the like? what men have I!</LINE>
<LINE>Dogs! cowards! dastards! I would ne'er have fled,</LINE>
<LINE>But that they left me 'midst my enemies.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REIGNIER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Salisbury is a desperate homicide;</LINE>
<LINE>He fighteth as one weary of his life.</LINE>
<LINE>The other lords, like lions wanting food,</LINE>
<LINE>Do rush upon us as their hungry prey.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALENCON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Froissart, a countryman of ours, records,</LINE>
<LINE>England all Olivers and Rowlands bred,</LINE>
<LINE>During the time Edward the Third did reign.</LINE>
<LINE>More truly now may this be verified;</LINE>
<LINE>For none but Samsons and Goliases</LINE>
<LINE>It sendeth forth to skirmish. One to ten!</LINE>
<LINE>Lean, raw-boned rascals! who would e'er suppose</LINE>
<LINE>They had such courage and audacity?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let's leave this town; for they are hare-brain'd slaves,</LINE>
<LINE>And hunger will enforce them to be more eager:</LINE>
<LINE>Of old I know them; rather with their teeth</LINE>
<LINE>The walls they'll tear down than forsake the siege.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REIGNIER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I think, by some odd gimmors or device</LINE>
<LINE>Their arms are set like clocks, stiff to strike on;</LINE>
<LINE>Else ne'er could they hold out so as they do.</LINE>
<LINE>By my consent, we'll even let them alone.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALENCON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Be it so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter the BASTARD OF ORLEANS</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BASTARD OF ORLEANS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where's the Prince Dauphin? I have news for him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Bastard of Orleans, thrice welcome to us.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BASTARD OF ORLEANS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Methinks your looks are sad, your cheer appall'd:</LINE>
<LINE>Hath the late overthrow wrought this offence?</LINE>
<LINE>Be not dismay'd, for succor is at hand:</LINE>
<LINE>A holy maid hither with me I bring,</LINE>
<LINE>Which by a vision sent to her from heaven</LINE>
<LINE>Ordained is to raise this tedious siege</LINE>
<LINE>And drive the English forth the bounds of France.</LINE>
<LINE>The spirit of deep prophecy she hath,</LINE>
<LINE>Exceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome:</LINE>
<LINE>What's past and what's to come she can descry.</LINE>
<LINE>Speak, shall I call her in? Believe my words,</LINE>
<LINE>For they are certain and unfallible.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go, call her in.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit BASTARD OF ORLEANS</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>But first, to try her skill,</LINE>
<LINE>Reignier, stand thou as Dauphin in my place:</LINE>
<LINE>Question her proudly; let thy looks be stern:</LINE>
<LINE>By this means shall we sound what skill she hath.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Re-enter the BASTARD OF ORLEANS, with JOAN LA PUCELLE</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REIGNIER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fair maid, is't thou wilt do these wondrous feats?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JOAN LA PUCELLE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Reignier, is't thou that thinkest to beguile me?</LINE>
<LINE>Where is the Dauphin? Come, come from behind;</LINE>
<LINE>I know thee well, though never seen before.</LINE>
<LINE>Be not amazed, there's nothing hid from me:</LINE>
<LINE>In private will I talk with thee apart.</LINE>
<LINE>Stand back, you lords, and give us leave awhile.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REIGNIER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She takes upon her bravely at first dash.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JOAN LA PUCELLE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Dauphin, I am by birth a shepherd's daughter,</LINE>
<LINE>My wit untrain'd in any kind of art.</LINE>
<LINE>Heaven and our Lady gracious hath it pleased</LINE>
<LINE>To shine on my contemptible estate:</LINE>
<LINE>Lo, whilst I waited on my tender lambs,</LINE>
<LINE>And to sun's parching heat display'd my cheeks,</LINE>
<LINE>God's mother deigned to appear to me</LINE>
<LINE>And in a vision full of majesty</LINE>
<LINE>Will'd me to leave my base vocation</LINE>
<LINE>And free my country from calamity:</LINE>
<LINE>Her aid she promised and assured success:</LINE>
<LINE>In complete glory she reveal'd herself;</LINE>
<LINE>And, whereas I was black and swart before,</LINE>
<LINE>With those clear rays which she infused on me</LINE>
<LINE>That beauty am I bless'd with which you see.</LINE>
<LINE>Ask me what question thou canst possible,</LINE>
<LINE>And I will answer unpremeditated:</LINE>
<LINE>My courage try by combat, if thou darest,</LINE>
<LINE>And thou shalt find that I exceed my sex.</LINE>
<LINE>Resolve on this, thou shalt be fortunate,</LINE>
<LINE>If thou receive me for thy warlike mate.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou hast astonish'd me with thy high terms:</LINE>
<LINE>Only this proof I'll of thy valour make,</LINE>
<LINE>In single combat thou shalt buckle with me,</LINE>
<LINE>And if thou vanquishest, thy words are true;</LINE>
<LINE>Otherwise I renounce all confidence.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JOAN LA PUCELLE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am prepared: here is my keen-edged sword,</LINE>
<LINE>Deck'd with five flower-de-luces on each side;</LINE>
<LINE>The which at Touraine, in Saint Katharine's</LINE>
<LINE>churchyard,</LINE>
<LINE>Out of a great deal of old iron I chose forth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then come, o' God's name; I fear no woman.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JOAN LA PUCELLE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And while I live, I'll ne'er fly from a man.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Here they fight, and JOAN LA PUCELLE overcomes</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Stay, stay thy hands! thou art an Amazon</LINE>
<LINE>And fightest with the sword of Deborah.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JOAN LA PUCELLE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Christ's mother helps me, else I were too weak.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Whoe'er helps thee, 'tis thou that must help me:</LINE>
<LINE>Impatiently I burn with thy desire;</LINE>
<LINE>My heart and hands thou hast at once subdued.</LINE>
<LINE>Excellent Pucelle, if thy name be so,</LINE>
<LINE>Let me thy servant and not sovereign be:</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis the French Dauphin sueth to thee thus.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JOAN LA PUCELLE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I must not yield to any rites of love,</LINE>
<LINE>For my profession's sacred from above:</LINE>
<LINE>When I have chased all thy foes from hence,</LINE>
<LINE>Then will I think upon a recompense.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Meantime look gracious on thy prostrate thrall.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REIGNIER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, methinks, is very long in talk.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALENCON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Doubtless he shrives this woman to her smock;</LINE>
<LINE>Else ne'er could he so long protract his speech.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REIGNIER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Shall we disturb him, since he keeps no mean?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALENCON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He may mean more than we poor men do know:</LINE>

<LINE>Glory is like a circle in the water,</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Stand back, thou manifest conspirator,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou that contrivedst to murder our dead lord;</LINE>
<LINE>Thou that givest whores indulgences to sin:</LINE>

<LINE>I mean to tug it and to cuff you soundly:</LINE>
<LINE>Under my feet I stamp thy cardinal's hat:</LINE>
<LINE>In spite of pope or dignities of church,</LINE>
<LINE>Here by the cheeks I'll drag thee up and down.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Peace, mayor! thou know'st little of my wrongs:</LINE>
<LINE>Here's Beaufort, that regards nor God nor king,</LINE>
<LINE>Hath here distrain'd the Tower to his use.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BISHOP OF WINCHESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here's Gloucester, a foe to citizens,</LINE>
<LINE>One that still motions war and never peace,</LINE>
<LINE>O'ercharging your free purses with large fines,</LINE>
<LINE>That seeks to overthrow religion,</LINE>
<LINE>Because he is protector of the realm,</LINE>
<LINE>And would have armour here out of the Tower,</LINE>
<LINE>To crown himself king and suppress the prince.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will not answer thee with words, but blows.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Master-Gunner</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sirrah, thou know'st how Orleans is besieged,</LINE>
<LINE>And how the English have the suburbs won.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Boy</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Father, I know; and oft have shot at them,</LINE>
<LINE>Howe'er unfortunate I miss'd my aim.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Master-Gunner</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But now thou shalt not. Be thou ruled by me:</LINE>
<LINE>Chief master-gunner am I of this town;</LINE>
<LINE>Something I must do to procure me grace.</LINE>
<LINE>The prince's espials have informed me</LINE>
<LINE>How the English, in the suburbs close intrench'd,</LINE>
<LINE>Wont, through a secret grate of iron bars</LINE>
<LINE>In yonder tower, to overpeer the city,</LINE>
<LINE>And thence discover how with most advantage</LINE>
<LINE>They may vex us with shot, or with assault.</LINE>
<LINE>To intercept this inconvenience,</LINE>
<LINE>A piece of ordnance 'gainst it I have placed;</LINE>
<LINE>And even these three days have I watch'd,</LINE>
<LINE>If I could see them.</LINE>
<LINE>Now do thou watch, for I can stay no longer.</LINE>
<LINE>If thou spy'st any, run and bring me word;</LINE>
<LINE>And thou shalt find me at the governor's.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Father, I warrant you; take you no care;</LINE>
<LINE>I'll never trouble you, if I may spy them.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>Enter, on the turrets, SALISBURY and TALBOT,
GLANSDALE, GARGRAVE, and others</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SALISBURY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Talbot, my life, my joy, again return'd!</LINE>
<LINE>How wert thou handled being prisoner?</LINE>
<LINE>Or by what means got'st thou to be released?</LINE>
<LINE>Discourse, I prithee, on this turret's top.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TALBOT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The Duke of Bedford had a prisoner</LINE>
<LINE>Call'd the brave Lord Ponton de Santrailles;</LINE>
<LINE>For him was I exchanged and ransomed.</LINE>
<LINE>But with a baser man of arms by far</LINE>
<LINE>Once in contempt they would have barter'd me:</LINE>
<LINE>Which I, disdaining, scorn'd; and craved death,</LINE>
<LINE>Rather than I would be so vile esteem'd.</LINE>
<LINE>In fine, redeem'd I was as I desired.</LINE>
<LINE>But, O! the treacherous Fastolfe wounds my heart,</LINE>
<LINE>Whom with my bare fists I would execute,</LINE>
<LINE>If I now had him brought into my power.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SALISBURY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yet tell'st thou not how thou wert entertain'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TALBOT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With scoffs and scorns and contumelious taunts.</LINE>
<LINE>In open market-place produced they me,</LINE>
<LINE>To be a public spectacle to all:</LINE>
<LINE>Here, said they, is the terror of the French,</LINE>
<LINE>The scarecrow that affrights our children so.</LINE>
<LINE>Then broke I from the officers that led me,</LINE>
<LINE>And with my nails digg'd stones out of the ground,</LINE>
<LINE>To hurl at the beholders of my shame:</LINE>
<LINE>My grisly countenance made others fly;</LINE>
<LINE>None durst come near for fear of sudden death.</LINE>
<LINE>In iron walls they deem'd me not secure;</LINE>
<LINE>So great fear of my name 'mongst them was spread,</LINE>
<LINE>That they supposed I could rend bars of steel,</LINE>
<LINE>And spurn in pieces posts of adamant:</LINE>
<LINE>Wherefore a guard of chosen shot I had,</LINE>
<LINE>That walked about me every minute-while;</LINE>
<LINE>And if I did but stir out of my bed,</LINE>
<LINE>Ready they were to shoot me to the heart.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter the Boy with a linstock</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SALISBURY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I grieve to hear what torments you endured,</LINE>
<LINE>But we will be revenged sufficiently</LINE>
<LINE>Now it is supper-time in Orleans:</LINE>
<LINE>Here, through this grate, I count each one</LINE>
<LINE>and view the Frenchmen how they fortify:</LINE>
<LINE>Let us look in; the sight will much delight thee.</LINE>
<LINE>Sir Thomas Gargrave, and Sir William Glansdale,</LINE>
<LINE>Let me have your express opinions</LINE>
<LINE>Where is best place to make our battery next.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GARGRAVE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I think, at the north gate; for there stand lords.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLANSDALE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And I, here, at the bulwark of the bridge.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TALBOT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For aught I see, this city must be famish'd,</LINE>
<LINE>Or with light skirmishes enfeebled.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Here they shoot. SALISBURY and GARGRAVE fall</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>What chance is this that suddenly hath cross'd us?</LINE>
<LINE>Speak, Salisbury; at least, if thou canst speak:</LINE>
<LINE>How farest thou, mirror of all martial men?</LINE>
<LINE>One of thy eyes and thy cheek's side struck off!</LINE>
<LINE>Accursed tower! accursed fatal hand</LINE>
<LINE>That hath contrived this woful tragedy!</LINE>
<LINE>In thirteen battles Salisbury o'ercame;</LINE>
<LINE>Henry the Fifth he first train'd to the wars;</LINE>
<LINE>Whilst any trump did sound, or drum struck up,</LINE>
<LINE>His sword did ne'er leave striking in the field.</LINE>
<LINE>Yet livest thou, Salisbury? though thy speech doth fail,</LINE>
<LINE>One eye thou hast, to look to heaven for grace:</LINE>
<LINE>The sun with one eye vieweth all the world.</LINE>
<LINE>Heaven, be thou gracious to none alive,</LINE>
<LINE>If Salisbury wants mercy at thy hands!</LINE>
<LINE>Bear hence his body; I will help to bury it.</LINE>
<LINE>Sir Thomas Gargrave, hast thou any life?</LINE>
<LINE>Speak unto Talbot; nay, look up to him.</LINE>
<LINE>Salisbury, cheer thy spirit with this comfort;</LINE>
<LINE>Thou shalt not die whiles--</LINE>
<LINE>He beckons with his hand and smiles on me.</LINE>
<LINE>As who should say 'When I am dead and gone,</LINE>
<LINE>Remember to avenge me on the French.'</LINE>
<LINE>Plantagenet, I will; and like thee, Nero,</LINE>
<LINE>Play on the lute, beholding the towns burn:</LINE>
<LINE>Wretched shall France be only in my name.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Here an alarum, and it thunders and lightens</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>Frenchmen, I'll be a Salisbury to you:</LINE>
<LINE>Pucelle or puzzel, dolphin or dogfish,</LINE>
<LINE>Your hearts I'll stamp out with my horse's heels,</LINE>
<LINE>And make a quagmire of your mingled brains.</LINE>

<LINE>They call'd us for our fierceness English dogs;</LINE>
<LINE>Now, like to whelps, we crying run away.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>A short alarum</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Hark, countrymen! either renew the fight,</LINE>
<LINE>Or tear the lions out of England's coat;</LINE>
<LINE>Renounce your soil, give sheep in lions' stead:</LINE>
<LINE>Sheep run not half so treacherous from the wolf,</LINE>
<LINE>Or horse or oxen from the leopard,</LINE>
<LINE>As you fly from your oft-subdued slaves.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Alarum. Here another skirmish</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>It will not be: retire into your trenches:</LINE>

<LINE>By whose approach the regions of Artois,</LINE>
<LINE>Wallon and Picardy are friends to us,</LINE>
<LINE>This happy night the Frenchmen are secure,</LINE>
<LINE>Having all day caroused and banqueted:</LINE>
<LINE>Embrace we then this opportunity</LINE>
<LINE>As fitting best to quittance their deceit</LINE>
<LINE>Contrived by art and baleful sorcery.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEDFORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Coward of France! how much he wrongs his fame,</LINE>
<LINE>Despairing of his own arm's fortitude,</LINE>
<LINE>To join with witches and the help of hell!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BURGUNDY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Traitors have never other company.</LINE>
<LINE>But what's that Pucelle whom they term so pure?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TALBOT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A maid, they say.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEDFORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A maid! and be so martial!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BURGUNDY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pray God she prove not masculine ere long,</LINE>
<LINE>If underneath the standard of the French</LINE>
<LINE>She carry armour as she hath begun.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TALBOT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, let them practise and converse with spirits:</LINE>
<LINE>God is our fortress, in whose conquering name</LINE>
<LINE>Let us resolve to scale their flinty bulwarks.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEDFORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ascend, brave Talbot; we will follow thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TALBOT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not all together: better far, I guess,</LINE>
<LINE>That we do make our entrance several ways;</LINE>
<LINE>That, if it chance the one of us do fail,</LINE>
<LINE>The other yet may rise against their force.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEDFORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Agreed: I'll to yond corner.</LINE>

<LINE>Now, Salisbury, for thee, and for the right</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>The French leap over the walls in their shirts.
Enter, several ways, the BASTARD OF ORLEANS,
ALENCON, and REIGNIER, half ready, and half unready</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALENCON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How now, my lords! what, all unready so?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BASTARD OF ORLEANS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Unready! ay, and glad we 'scaped so well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REIGNIER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Twas time, I trow, to wake and leave our beds,</LINE>
<LINE>Hearing alarums at our chamber-doors.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALENCON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Of all exploits since first I follow'd arms,</LINE>
<LINE>Ne'er heard I of a warlike enterprise</LINE>
<LINE>More venturous or desperate than this.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BASTARD OF ORLEANS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I think this Talbot be a fiend of hell.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>REIGNIER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If not of hell, the heavens, sure, favour him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALENCON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here cometh Charles: I marvel how he sped.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BASTARD OF ORLEANS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tut, holy Joan was his defensive guard.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter CHARLES and JOAN LA PUCELLE</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is this thy cunning, thou deceitful dame?</LINE>
<LINE>Didst thou at first, to flatter us withal,</LINE>
<LINE>Make us partakers of a little gain,</LINE>
<LINE>That now our loss might be ten times so much?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JOAN LA PUCELLE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Wherefore is Charles impatient with his friend!</LINE>
<LINE>At all times will you have my power alike?</LINE>
<LINE>Sleeping or waking must I still prevail,</LINE>
<LINE>Or will you blame and lay the fault on me?</LINE>
<LINE>Improvident soldiers! had your watch been good,</LINE>
<LINE>This sudden mischief never could have fall'n.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Duke of Alencon, this was your default,</LINE>
<LINE>That, being captain of the watch to-night,</LINE>
<LINE>Did look no better to that weighty charge.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALENCON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Had all your quarters been as safely kept</LINE>
<LINE>As that whereof I had the government,</LINE>
<LINE>We had not been thus shamefully surprised.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BASTARD OF ORLEANS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Mine was secure.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REIGNIER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And so was mine, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And, for myself, most part of all this night,</LINE>
<LINE>Within her quarter and mine own precinct</LINE>
<LINE>I was employ'd in passing to and fro,</LINE>
<LINE>About relieving of the sentinels:</LINE>
<LINE>Then how or which way should they first break in?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JOAN LA PUCELLE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Question, my lords, no further of the case,</LINE>
<LINE>How or which way: 'tis sure they found some place</LINE>
<LINE>But weakly guarded, where the breach was made.</LINE>
<LINE>And now there rests no other shift but this;</LINE>
<LINE>To gather our soldiers, scatter'd and dispersed,</LINE>
<LINE>And lay new platforms to endamage them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Alarum. Enter an English Soldier, crying 'A
Talbot! a Talbot!' They fly, leaving their
clothes behind</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Soldier</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll be so bold to take what they have left.</LINE>
<LINE>The cry of Talbot serves me for a sword;</LINE>
<LINE>For I have loaden me with many spoils,</LINE>
<LINE>Using no other weapon but his name.</LINE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE II.  Orleans. Within the town.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter TALBOT, BEDFORD, BURGUNDY, a Captain, and others</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEDFORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The day begins to break, and night is fled,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose pitchy mantle over-veil'd the earth.</LINE>
<LINE>Here sound retreat, and cease our hot pursuit.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Retreat sounded</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TALBOT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Bring forth the body of old Salisbury,</LINE>
<LINE>And here advance it in the market-place,</LINE>
<LINE>The middle centre of this cursed town.</LINE>
<LINE>Now have I paid my vow unto his soul;</LINE>
<LINE>For every drop of blood was drawn from him,</LINE>
<LINE>There hath at least five Frenchmen died tonight.</LINE>
<LINE>And that hereafter ages may behold</LINE>
<LINE>What ruin happen'd in revenge of him,</LINE>
<LINE>Within their chiefest temple I'll erect</LINE>
<LINE>A tomb, wherein his corpse shall be interr'd:</LINE>
<LINE>Upon the which, that every one may read,</LINE>
<LINE>Shall be engraved the sack of Orleans,</LINE>
<LINE>The treacherous manner of his mournful death</LINE>
<LINE>And what a terror he had been to France.</LINE>
<LINE>But, lords, in all our bloody massacre,</LINE>
<LINE>I muse we met not with the Dauphin's grace,</LINE>
<LINE>His new-come champion, virtuous Joan of Arc,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor any of his false confederates.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEDFORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis thought, Lord Talbot, when the fight began,</LINE>
<LINE>Roused on the sudden from their drowsy beds,</LINE>
<LINE>They did amongst the troops of armed men</LINE>
<LINE>Leap o'er the walls for refuge in the field.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BURGUNDY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Myself, as far as I could well discern</LINE>
<LINE>For smoke and dusky vapours of the night,</LINE>
<LINE>Am sure I scared the Dauphin and his trull,</LINE>
<LINE>When arm in arm they both came swiftly running,</LINE>
<LINE>Like to a pair of loving turtle-doves</LINE>
<LINE>That could not live asunder day or night.</LINE>
<LINE>After that things are set in order here,</LINE>
<LINE>We'll follow them with all the power we have.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>All hail, my lords! which of this princely train</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The virtuous lady, Countess of Auvergne,</LINE>
<LINE>With modesty admiring thy renown,</LINE>
<LINE>By me entreats, great lord, thou wouldst vouchsafe</LINE>
<LINE>To visit her poor castle where she lies,</LINE>
<LINE>That she may boast she hath beheld the man</LINE>
<LINE>Whose glory fills the world with loud report.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BURGUNDY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is it even so? Nay, then, I see our wars</LINE>
<LINE>Will turn unto a peaceful comic sport,</LINE>
<LINE>When ladies crave to be encounter'd with.</LINE>
<LINE>You may not, my lord, despise her gentle suit.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TALBOT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ne'er trust me then; for when a world of men</LINE>
<LINE>Could not prevail with all their oratory,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet hath a woman's kindness over-ruled:</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore tell her I return great thanks,</LINE>
<LINE>And in submission will attend on her.</LINE>
<LINE>Will not your honours bear me company?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEDFORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, truly; it is more than manners will:</LINE>
<LINE>And I have heard it said, unbidden guests</LINE>
<LINE>Are often welcomest when they are gone.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TALBOT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well then, alone, since there's no remedy,</LINE>
<LINE>I mean to prove this lady's courtesy.</LINE>
<LINE>Come hither, captain.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Whispers</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>You perceive my mind?</LINE>

<SPEAKER>COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The plot is laid: if all things fall out right,</LINE>
<LINE>I shall as famous be by this exploit</LINE>
<LINE>As Scythian Tomyris by Cyrus' death.</LINE>
<LINE>Great is the rumor of this dreadful knight,</LINE>
<LINE>And his achievements of no less account:</LINE>
<LINE>Fain would mine eyes be witness with mine ears,</LINE>
<LINE>To give their censure of these rare reports.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Messenger and TALBOT</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam,</LINE>
<LINE>According as your ladyship desired,</LINE>
<LINE>By message craved, so is Lord Talbot come.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And he is welcome. What! is this the man?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam, it is.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is this the scourge of France?</LINE>
<LINE>Is this the Talbot, so much fear'd abroad</LINE>
<LINE>That with his name the mothers still their babes?</LINE>
<LINE>I see report is fabulous and false:</LINE>
<LINE>I thought I should have seen some Hercules,</LINE>
<LINE>A second Hector, for his grim aspect,</LINE>
<LINE>And large proportion of his strong-knit limbs.</LINE>
<LINE>Alas, this is a child, a silly dwarf!</LINE>
<LINE>It cannot be this weak and writhled shrimp</LINE>
<LINE>Should strike such terror to his enemies.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TALBOT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam, I have been bold to trouble you;</LINE>
<LINE>But since your ladyship is not at leisure,</LINE>
<LINE>I'll sort some other time to visit you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What means he now? Go ask him whither he goes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Stay, my Lord Talbot; for my lady craves</LINE>
<LINE>To know the cause of your abrupt departure.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TALBOT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, for that she's in a wrong belief,</LINE>
<LINE>I go to certify her Talbot's here.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If thou be he, then art thou prisoner.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TALBOT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Prisoner! to whom?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To me, blood-thirsty lord;</LINE>
<LINE>And for that cause I trained thee to my house.</LINE>
<LINE>Long time thy shadow hath been thrall to me,</LINE>
<LINE>For in my gallery thy picture hangs:</LINE>
<LINE>But now the substance shall endure the like,</LINE>
<LINE>And I will chain these legs and arms of thine,</LINE>
<LINE>That hast by tyranny these many years</LINE>
<LINE>Wasted our country, slain our citizens</LINE>
<LINE>And sent our sons and husbands captivate.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TALBOT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ha, ha, ha!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Laughest thou, wretch? thy mirth shall turn to moan.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TALBOT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I laugh to see your ladyship so fond</LINE>
<LINE>To think that you have aught but Talbot's shadow</LINE>
<LINE>Whereon to practise your severity.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, art not thou the man?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TALBOT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am indeed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then have I substance too.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TALBOT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, no, I am but shadow of myself:</LINE>
<LINE>You are deceived, my substance is not here;</LINE>
<LINE>For what you see is but the smallest part</LINE>
<LINE>And least proportion of humanity:</LINE>
<LINE>I tell you, madam, were the whole frame here,</LINE>
<LINE>It is of such a spacious lofty pitch,</LINE>
<LINE>Your roof were not sufficient to contain't.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is a riddling merchant for the nonce;</LINE>
<LINE>He will be here, and yet he is not here:</LINE>
<LINE>How can these contrarieties agree?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TALBOT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That will I show you presently.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Winds his horn. Drums strike up: a peal of
ordnance. Enter soldiers</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>How say you, madam? are you now persuaded</LINE>
<LINE>That Talbot is but shadow of himself?</LINE>
<LINE>These are his substance, sinews, arms and strength,</LINE>
<LINE>With which he yoketh your rebellious necks,</LINE>
<LINE>Razeth your cities and subverts your towns</LINE>
<LINE>And in a moment makes them desolate.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Victorious Talbot! pardon my abuse:</LINE>
<LINE>I find thou art no less than fame hath bruited</LINE>
<LINE>And more than may be gather'd by thy shape.</LINE>
<LINE>Let my presumption not provoke thy wrath;</LINE>
<LINE>For I am sorry that with reverence</LINE>
<LINE>I did not entertain thee as thou art.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TALBOT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Be not dismay'd, fair lady; nor misconstrue</LINE>
<LINE>The mind of Talbot, as you did mistake</LINE>
<LINE>The outward composition of his body.</LINE>
<LINE>What you have done hath not offended me;</LINE>
<LINE>Nor other satisfaction do I crave,</LINE>
<LINE>But only, with your patience, that we may</LINE>
<LINE>Taste of your wine and see what cates you have;</LINE>
<LINE>For soldiers' stomachs always serve them well.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE</SPEAKER>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RICHARD PLANTAGENET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Great lords and gentlemen, what means this silence?</LINE>
<LINE>Dare no man answer in a case of truth?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Within the Temple-hall we were too loud;</LINE>
<LINE>The garden here is more convenient.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RICHARD PLANTAGENET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then say at once if I maintain'd the truth;</LINE>
<LINE>Or else was wrangling Somerset in the error?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Faith, I have been a truant in the law,</LINE>
<LINE>And never yet could frame my will to it;</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore frame the law unto my will.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SOMERSET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Judge you, my Lord of Warwick, then, between us.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WARWICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Between two hawks, which flies the higher pitch;</LINE>
<LINE>Between two dogs, which hath the deeper mouth;</LINE>
<LINE>Between two blades, which bears the better temper:</LINE>
<LINE>Between two horses, which doth bear him best;</LINE>
<LINE>Between two girls, which hath the merriest eye;</LINE>
<LINE>I have perhaps some shallow spirit of judgement;</LINE>
<LINE>But in these nice sharp quillets of the law,</LINE>
<LINE>Good faith, I am no wiser than a daw.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RICHARD PLANTAGENET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tut, tut, here is a mannerly forbearance:</LINE>
<LINE>The truth appears so naked on my side</LINE>
<LINE>That any purblind eye may find it out.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SOMERSET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And on my side it is so well apparell'd,</LINE>
<LINE>So clear, so shining and so evident</LINE>
<LINE>That it will glimmer through a blind man's eye.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RICHARD PLANTAGENET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Since you are tongue-tied and so loath to speak,</LINE>
<LINE>In dumb significants proclaim your thoughts:</LINE>
<LINE>Let him that is a true-born gentleman</LINE>
<LINE>And stands upon the honour of his birth,</LINE>
<LINE>If he suppose that I have pleaded truth,</LINE>
<LINE>From off this brier pluck a white rose with me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SOMERSET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let him that is no coward nor no flatterer,</LINE>
<LINE>But dare maintain the party of the truth,</LINE>
<LINE>Pluck a red rose from off this thorn with me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WARWICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I love no colours, and without all colour</LINE>
<LINE>Of base insinuating flattery</LINE>
<LINE>I pluck this white rose with Plantagenet.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I pluck this red rose with young Somerset</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VERNON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Stay, lords and gentlemen, and pluck no more,</LINE>
<LINE>Till you conclude that he upon whose side</LINE>
<LINE>The fewest roses are cropp'd from the tree</LINE>
<LINE>Shall yield the other in the right opinion.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SOMERSET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good Master Vernon, it is well objected:</LINE>
<LINE>If I have fewest, I subscribe in silence.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RICHARD PLANTAGENET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And I.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VERNON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then for the truth and plainness of the case.</LINE>
<LINE>I pluck this pale and maiden blossom here,</LINE>
<LINE>Giving my verdict on the white rose side.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SOMERSET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Prick not your finger as you pluck it off,</LINE>
<LINE>Lest bleeding you do paint the white rose red</LINE>
<LINE>And fall on my side so, against your will.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VERNON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If I my lord, for my opinion bleed,</LINE>
<LINE>Opinion shall be surgeon to my hurt</LINE>
<LINE>And keep me on the side where still I am.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SOMERSET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, well, come on: who else?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Lawyer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Unless my study and my books be false,</LINE>
<LINE>The argument you held was wrong in you:</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>To SOMERSET</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>In sign whereof I pluck a white rose too.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RICHARD PLANTAGENET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, Somerset, where is your argument?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SOMERSET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here in my scabbard, meditating that</LINE>
<LINE>Shall dye your white rose in a bloody red.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RICHARD PLANTAGENET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Meantime your cheeks do counterfeit our roses;</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SOMERSET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, Plantagenet,</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis not for fear but anger that thy cheeks</LINE>

<LINE>Ay, sharp and piercing, to maintain his truth;</LINE>
<LINE>Whiles thy consuming canker eats his falsehood.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SOMERSET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, I'll find friends to wear my bleeding roses,</LINE>
<LINE>That shall maintain what I have said is true,</LINE>
<LINE>Where false Plantagenet dare not be seen.</LINE>

<LINE>His grandfather was Lionel Duke of Clarence,</LINE>
<LINE>Third son to the third Edward King of England:</LINE>
<LINE>Spring crestless yeomen from so deep a root?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RICHARD PLANTAGENET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He bears him on the place's privilege,</LINE>
<LINE>Or durst not, for his craven heart, say thus.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SOMERSET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By him that made me, I'll maintain my words</LINE>
<LINE>On any plot of ground in Christendom.</LINE>
<LINE>Was not thy father, Richard Earl of Cambridge,</LINE>
<LINE>For treason executed in our late king's days?</LINE>
<LINE>And, by his treason, stand'st not thou attainted,</LINE>
<LINE>Corrupted, and exempt from ancient gentry?</LINE>
<LINE>His trespass yet lives guilty in thy blood;</LINE>
<LINE>And, till thou be restored, thou art a yeoman.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RICHARD PLANTAGENET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My father was attached, not attainted,</LINE>
<LINE>Condemn'd to die for treason, but no traitor;</LINE>
<LINE>And that I'll prove on better men than Somerset,</LINE>
<LINE>Were growing time once ripen'd to my will.</LINE>
<LINE>For your partaker Pole and you yourself,</LINE>
<LINE>I'll note you in my book of memory,</LINE>
<LINE>To scourge you for this apprehension:</LINE>
<LINE>Look to it well and say you are well warn'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SOMERSET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ah, thou shalt find us ready for thee still;</LINE>
<LINE>And know us by these colours for thy foes,</LINE>
<LINE>For these my friends in spite of thee shall wear.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RICHARD PLANTAGENET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And, by my soul, this pale and angry rose,</LINE>
<LINE>As cognizance of my blood-drinking hate,</LINE>
<LINE>Will I for ever and my faction wear,</LINE>
<LINE>Until it wither with me to my grave</LINE>
<LINE>Or flourish to the height of my degree.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go forward and be choked with thy ambition!</LINE>
<LINE>And so farewell until I meet thee next.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SOMERSET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Have with thee, Pole. Farewell, ambitious Richard.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RICHARD PLANTAGENET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How I am braved and must perforce endure it!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WARWICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This blot that they object against your house</LINE>
<LINE>Shall be wiped out in the next parliament</LINE>
<LINE>Call'd for the truce of Winchester and Gloucester;</LINE>
<LINE>And if thou be not then created York,</LINE>
<LINE>I will not live to be accounted Warwick.</LINE>
<LINE>Meantime, in signal of my love to thee,</LINE>
<LINE>Against proud Somerset and William Pole,</LINE>
<LINE>Will I upon thy party wear this rose:</LINE>
<LINE>And here I prophesy: this brawl to-day,</LINE>
<LINE>Grown to this faction in the Temple-garden,</LINE>
<LINE>Shall send between the red rose and the white</LINE>
<LINE>A thousand souls to death and deadly night.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RICHARD PLANTAGENET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good Master Vernon, I am bound to you,</LINE>
<LINE>That you on my behalf would pluck a flower.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VERNON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In your behalf still will I wear the same.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Lawyer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And so will I.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RICHARD PLANTAGENET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thanks, gentle sir.</LINE>

<LINE>This quarrel will drink blood another day.</LINE>

</SCENE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE V.  The Tower of London.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter MORTIMER, brought in a chair, and Gaolers</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MORTIMER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Kind keepers of my weak decaying age,</LINE>
<LINE>Let dying Mortimer here rest himself.</LINE>
<LINE>Even like a man new haled from the rack,</LINE>
<LINE>So fare my limbs with long imprisonment.</LINE>
<LINE>And these grey locks, the pursuivants of death,</LINE>
<LINE>Nestor-like aged in an age of care,</LINE>
<LINE>Argue the end of Edmund Mortimer.</LINE>
<LINE>These eyes, like lamps whose wasting oil is spent,</LINE>
<LINE>Wax dim, as drawing to their exigent;</LINE>
<LINE>Weak shoulders, overborne with burthening grief,</LINE>
<LINE>And pithless arms, like to a wither'd vine</LINE>
<LINE>That droops his sapless branches to the ground;</LINE>
<LINE>Yet are these feet, whose strengthless stay is numb,</LINE>
<LINE>Unable to support this lump of clay,</LINE>
<LINE>Swift-winged with desire to get a grave,</LINE>
<LINE>As witting I no other comfort have.</LINE>
<LINE>But tell me, keeper, will my nephew come?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Gaoler</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Richard Plantagenet, my lord, will come:</LINE>
<LINE>We sent unto the Temple, unto his chamber;</LINE>
<LINE>And answer was return'd that he will come.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MORTIMER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Enough: my soul shall then be satisfied.</LINE>
<LINE>Poor gentleman! his wrong doth equal mine.</LINE>
<LINE>Since Henry Monmouth first began to reign,</LINE>
<LINE>Before whose glory I was great in arms,</LINE>
<LINE>This loathsome sequestration have I had:</LINE>
<LINE>And even since then hath Richard been obscured,</LINE>
<LINE>Deprived of honour and inheritance.</LINE>
<LINE>But now the arbitrator of despairs,</LINE>
<LINE>Just death, kind umpire of men's miseries,</LINE>
<LINE>With sweet enlargement doth dismiss me hence:</LINE>
<LINE>I would his troubles likewise were expired,</LINE>
<LINE>That so he might recover what was lost.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter RICHARD PLANTAGENET</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Gaoler</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, your loving nephew now is come.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MORTIMER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Richard Plantagenet, my friend, is he come?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RICHARD PLANTAGENET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, noble uncle, thus ignobly used,</LINE>
<LINE>Your nephew, late despised Richard, comes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MORTIMER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Direct mine arms I may embrace his neck,</LINE>
<LINE>And in his bosom spend my latter gasp:</LINE>
<LINE>O, tell me when my lips do touch his cheeks,</LINE>
<LINE>That I may kindly give one fainting kiss.</LINE>
<LINE>And now declare, sweet stem from York's great stock,</LINE>
<LINE>Why didst thou say, of late thou wert despised?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RICHARD PLANTAGENET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>First, lean thine aged back against mine arm;</LINE>
<LINE>And, in that ease, I'll tell thee my disease.</LINE>
<LINE>This day, in argument upon a case,</LINE>
<LINE>Some words there grew 'twixt Somerset and me;</LINE>
<LINE>Among which terms he used his lavish tongue</LINE>
<LINE>And did upbraid me with my father's death:</LINE>
<LINE>Which obloquy set bars before my tongue,</LINE>
<LINE>Else with the like I had requited him.</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore, good uncle, for my father's sake,</LINE>
<LINE>In honour of a true Plantagenet</LINE>
<LINE>And for alliance sake, declare the cause</LINE>
<LINE>My father, Earl of Cambridge, lost his head.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MORTIMER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That cause, fair nephew, that imprison'd me</LINE>
<LINE>And hath detain'd me all my flowering youth</LINE>
<LINE>Within a loathsome dungeon, there to pine,</LINE>
<LINE>Was cursed instrument of his decease.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RICHARD PLANTAGENET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Discover more at large what cause that was,</LINE>
<LINE>For I am ignorant and cannot guess.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MORTIMER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will, if that my fading breath permit</LINE>
<LINE>And death approach not ere my tale be done.</LINE>
<LINE>Henry the Fourth, grandfather to this king,</LINE>
<LINE>Deposed his nephew Richard, Edward's son,</LINE>
<LINE>The first-begotten and the lawful heir,</LINE>
<LINE>Of Edward king, the third of that descent:</LINE>
<LINE>During whose reign the Percies of the north,</LINE>
<LINE>Finding his usurpation most unjust,</LINE>
<LINE>Endeavor'd my advancement to the throne:</LINE>
<LINE>The reason moved these warlike lords to this</LINE>
<LINE>Was, for that--young King Richard thus removed,</LINE>
<LINE>Leaving no heir begotten of his body--</LINE>
<LINE>I was the next by birth and parentage;</LINE>
<LINE>For by my mother I derived am</LINE>
<LINE>From Lionel Duke of Clarence, the third son</LINE>
<LINE>To King Edward the Third; whereas he</LINE>
<LINE>From John of Gaunt doth bring his pedigree,</LINE>
<LINE>Being but fourth of that heroic line.</LINE>
<LINE>But mark: as in this haughty attempt</LINE>
<LINE>They laboured to plant the rightful heir,</LINE>
<LINE>I lost my liberty and they their lives.</LINE>
<LINE>Long after this, when Henry the Fifth,</LINE>
<LINE>Succeeding his father Bolingbroke, did reign,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy father, Earl of Cambridge, then derived</LINE>
<LINE>From famous Edmund Langley, Duke of York,</LINE>
<LINE>Marrying my sister that thy mother was,</LINE>
<LINE>Again in pity of my hard distress</LINE>
<LINE>Levied an army, weening to redeem</LINE>
<LINE>And have install'd me in the diadem:</LINE>
<LINE>But, as the rest, so fell that noble earl</LINE>
<LINE>And was beheaded. Thus the Mortimers,</LINE>
<LINE>In whom the tide rested, were suppress'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RICHARD PLANTAGENET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Of which, my lord, your honour is the last.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MORTIMER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>True; and thou seest that I no issue have</LINE>
<LINE>And that my fainting words do warrant death;</LINE>
<LINE>Thou art my heir; the rest I wish thee gather:</LINE>
<LINE>But yet be wary in thy studious care.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RICHARD PLANTAGENET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thy grave admonishments prevail with me:</LINE>
<LINE>But yet, methinks, my father's execution</LINE>
<LINE>Was nothing less than bloody tyranny.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MORTIMER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With silence, nephew, be thou politic:</LINE>
<LINE>Strong-fixed is the house of Lancaster,</LINE>
<LINE>And like a mountain, not to be removed.</LINE>
<LINE>But now thy uncle is removing hence:</LINE>
<LINE>As princes do their courts, when they are cloy'd</LINE>
<LINE>With long continuance in a settled place.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RICHARD PLANTAGENET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, uncle, would some part of my young years</LINE>
<LINE>Might but redeem the passage of your age!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MORTIMER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou dost then wrong me, as that slaughterer doth</LINE>
<LINE>Which giveth many wounds when one will kill.</LINE>
<LINE>Mourn not, except thou sorrow for my good;</LINE>
<LINE>Only give order for my funeral:</LINE>
<LINE>And so farewell, and fair be all thy hopes</LINE>
<LINE>And prosperous be thy life in peace and war!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Dies</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RICHARD PLANTAGENET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And peace, no war, befall thy parting soul!</LINE>
<LINE>In prison hast thou spent a pilgrimage</LINE>
<LINE>And like a hermit overpass'd thy days.</LINE>
<LINE>Well, I will lock his counsel in my breast;</LINE>
<LINE>And what I do imagine let that rest.</LINE>
<LINE>Keepers, convey him hence, and I myself</LINE>
<LINE>Will see his burial better than his life.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exeunt Gaolers, bearing out the body of MORTIMER</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Here dies the dusky torch of Mortimer,</LINE>
<LINE>Choked with ambition of the meaner sort:</LINE>
<LINE>And for those wrongs, those bitter injuries,</LINE>
<LINE>Which Somerset hath offer'd to my house:</LINE>
<LINE>I doubt not but with honour to redress;</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore haste I to the parliament,</LINE>
<LINE>Either to be restored to my blood,</LINE>
<LINE>Or make my ill the advantage of my good.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Flourish. Enter KING HENRY VI, EXETER, GLOUCESTER,
WARWICK, SOMERSET, and SUFFOLK; the BISHOP OF
WINCHESTER, RICHARD PLANTAGENET, and others.
GLOUCESTER offers to put up a bill; BISHOP OF
WINCHESTER snatches it, and tears it</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BISHOP OF WINCHESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Comest thou with deep premeditated lines,</LINE>
<LINE>With written pamphlets studiously devised,</LINE>
<LINE>Humphrey of Gloucester? If thou canst accuse,</LINE>
<LINE>Or aught intend'st to lay unto my charge,</LINE>
<LINE>Do it without invention, suddenly;</LINE>
<LINE>As I with sudden and extemporal speech</LINE>
<LINE>Purpose to answer what thou canst object.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Presumptuous priest! this place commands my patience,</LINE>
<LINE>Or thou shouldst find thou hast dishonour'd me.</LINE>
<LINE>Think not, although in writing I preferr'd</LINE>
<LINE>The manner of thy vile outrageous crimes,</LINE>
<LINE>That therefore I have forged, or am not able</LINE>
<LINE>Verbatim to rehearse the method of my pen:</LINE>
<LINE>No, prelate; such is thy audacious wickedness,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy lewd, pestiferous and dissentious pranks,</LINE>
<LINE>As very infants prattle of thy pride.</LINE>
<LINE>Thou art a most pernicious usurer,</LINE>
<LINE>Forward by nature, enemy to peace;</LINE>
<LINE>Lascivious, wanton, more than well beseems</LINE>
<LINE>A man of thy profession and degree;</LINE>
<LINE>And for thy treachery, what's more manifest?</LINE>
<LINE>In that thou laid'st a trap to take my life,</LINE>
<LINE>As well at London bridge as at the Tower.</LINE>
<LINE>Beside, I fear me, if thy thoughts were sifted,</LINE>
<LINE>The king, thy sovereign, is not quite exempt</LINE>
<LINE>From envious malice of thy swelling heart.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BISHOP OF WINCHESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Gloucester, I do defy thee. Lords, vouchsafe</LINE>
<LINE>To give me hearing what I shall reply.</LINE>
<LINE>If I were covetous, ambitious or perverse,</LINE>
<LINE>As he will have me, how am I so poor?</LINE>
<LINE>Or how haps it I seek not to advance</LINE>
<LINE>Or raise myself, but keep my wonted calling?</LINE>
<LINE>And for dissension, who preferreth peace</LINE>
<LINE>More than I do?--except I be provoked.</LINE>
<LINE>No, my good lords, it is not that offends;</LINE>
<LINE>It is not that that hath incensed the duke:</LINE>
<LINE>It is, because no one should sway but he;</LINE>
<LINE>No one but he should be about the king;</LINE>
<LINE>And that engenders thunder in his breast</LINE>
<LINE>And makes him roar these accusations forth.</LINE>
<LINE>But he shall know I am as good--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As good!</LINE>
<LINE>Thou bastard of my grandfather!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BISHOP OF WINCHESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, lordly sir; for what are you, I pray,</LINE>
<LINE>But one imperious in another's throne?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Am I not protector, saucy priest?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BISHOP OF WINCHESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And am not I a prelate of the church?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, as an outlaw in a castle keeps</LINE>
<LINE>And useth it to patronage his theft.</LINE>

<LINE>Methinks his lordship should be humbler;</LINE>
<LINE>it fitteth not a prelate so to plead.</LINE>

<LINE>Yes, when his holy state is touch'd so near.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>KING HENRY VI</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Uncles of Gloucester and of Winchester,</LINE>
<LINE>The special watchmen of our English weal,</LINE>
<LINE>I would prevail, if prayers might prevail,</LINE>

<LINE>O, what a scandal is it to our crown,</LINE>
<LINE>That two such noble peers as ye should jar!</LINE>
<LINE>Believe me, lords, my tender years can tell</LINE>
<LINE>Civil dissension is a viperous worm</LINE>
<LINE>That gnaws the bowels of the commonwealth.</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>O, my good lords, and virtuous Henry,</LINE>
<LINE>Pity the city of London, pity us!</LINE>
<LINE>The bishop and the Duke of Gloucester's men,</LINE>
<LINE>Forbidden late to carry any weapon,</LINE>
<LINE>Have fill'd their pockets full of pebble stones</LINE>
<LINE>And banding themselves in contrary parts</LINE>
<LINE>Do pelt so fast at one another's pate</LINE>
<LINE>That many have their giddy brains knock'd out:</LINE>
<LINE>Our windows are broke down in every street</LINE>
<LINE>And we for fear compell'd to shut our shops.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Serving-men, in skirmish, with bloody pates</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>

<SPEAKER>Third Serving-man</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, we know your grace to be a man</LINE>

<LINE>And ere that we will suffer such a prince,</LINE>
<LINE>So kind a father of the commonweal,</LINE>
<LINE>To be disgraced by an inkhorn mate,</LINE>
<LINE>We and our wives and children all will fight</LINE>
<LINE>And have our bodies slaughtered by thy foes.</LINE>

<LINE>O, how this discord doth afflict my soul!</LINE>
<LINE>Can you, my Lord of Winchester, behold</LINE>
<LINE>My sighs and tears and will not once relent?</LINE>
<LINE>Who should be pitiful, if you be not?</LINE>
<LINE>Or who should study to prefer a peace.</LINE>
<LINE>If holy churchmen take delight in broils?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WARWICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yield, my lord protector; yield, Winchester;</LINE>
<LINE>Except you mean with obstinate repulse</LINE>
<LINE>To slay your sovereign and destroy the realm.</LINE>
<LINE>You see what mischief and what murder too</LINE>
<LINE>Hath been enacted through your enmity;</LINE>
<LINE>Then be at peace except ye thirst for blood.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BISHOP OF WINCHESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He shall submit, or I will never yield.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Compassion on the king commands me stoop;</LINE>
<LINE>Or I would see his heart out, ere the priest</LINE>
<LINE>Should ever get that privilege of me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WARWICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Behold, my Lord of Winchester, the duke</LINE>
<LINE>Hath banish'd moody discontented fury,</LINE>
<LINE>As by his smoothed brows it doth appear:</LINE>
<LINE>Why look you still so stern and tragical?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here, Winchester, I offer thee my hand.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY VI</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fie, uncle Beaufort! I have heard you preach</LINE>
<LINE>That malice was a great and grievous sin;</LINE>
<LINE>And will not you maintain the thing you teach,</LINE>
<LINE>But prove a chief offender in the same?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WARWICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sweet king! the bishop hath a kindly gird.</LINE>
<LINE>For shame, my lord of Winchester, relent!</LINE>
<LINE>What, shall a child instruct you what to do?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BISHOP OF WINCHESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, Duke of Gloucester, I will yield to thee;</LINE>
<LINE>Love for thy love and hand for hand I give.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  Ay, but, I fear me, with a hollow heart.--</LINE>
<LINE>See here, my friends and loving countrymen,</LINE>
<LINE>This token serveth for a flag of truce</LINE>

<LINE>So help me God, as I dissemble not!</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well urged, my Lord of Warwick: or sweet prince,</LINE>

<SPEAKER>KING HENRY VI</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And those occasions, uncle, were of force:</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore, my loving lords, our pleasure is</LINE>
<LINE>That Richard be restored to his blood.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WARWICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let Richard be restored to his blood;</LINE>
<LINE>So shall his father's wrongs be recompensed.</LINE>

<LINE>If Richard will be true, not that alone</LINE>

<SPEAKER>RICHARD PLANTAGENET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thy humble servant vows obedience</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY VI</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Stoop then and set your knee against my foot;</LINE>
<LINE>And, in reguerdon of that duty done,</LINE>
<LINE>I gird thee with the valiant sword of York:</LINE>
<LINE>Rise Richard, like a true Plantagenet,</LINE>
<LINE>And rise created princely Duke of York.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now will it best avail your majesty</LINE>
<LINE>To cross the seas and to be crown'd in France:</LINE>
<LINE>The presence of a king engenders love</LINE>
<LINE>Amongst his subjects and his loyal friends,</LINE>
<LINE>As it disanimates his enemies.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EXETER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, we may march in England or in France,</LINE>
<LINE>Not seeing what is likely to ensue.</LINE>
<LINE>This late dissension grown betwixt the peers</LINE>
<LINE>Burns under feigned ashes of forged love</LINE>
<LINE>And will at last break out into a flame:</LINE>
<LINE>As fester'd members rot but by degree,</LINE>
<LINE>Till bones and flesh and sinews fall away,</LINE>
<LINE>So will this base and envious discord breed.</LINE>
<LINE>And now I fear that fatal prophecy</LINE>
<LINE>Which in the time of Henry named the Fifth</LINE>
<LINE>Was in the mouth of every sucking babe;</LINE>
<LINE>That Henry born at Monmouth should win all</LINE>
<LINE>And Henry born at Windsor lose all:</LINE>
<LINE>Which is so plain that Exeter doth wish</LINE>
<LINE>His days may finish ere that hapless time.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>JOAN LA PUCELLE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>These are the city gates, the gates of Rouen,</LINE>

<LINE>Talk like the vulgar sort of market men</LINE>
<LINE>That come to gather money for their corn.</LINE>
<LINE>If we have entrance, as I hope we shall,</LINE>
<LINE>And that we find the slothful watch but weak,</LINE>
<LINE>I'll by a sign give notice to our friends,</LINE>
<LINE>That Charles the Dauphin may encounter them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEAKER>First Soldier</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Our sacks shall be a mean to sack the city,</LINE>

<SPEAKER>REIGNIER</SPEAKER>

</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter JOAN LA PUCELLE on the top, thrusting out a
torch burning</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>Good morrow, gallants! want ye corn for bread?</LINE>
<LINE>I think the Duke of Burgundy will fast</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BURGUNDY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Scoff on, vile fiend and shameless courtezan!</LINE>

<LINE>What will you do, good grey-beard? break a lance,</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TALBOT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Foul fiend of France, and hag of all despite,</LINE>

<SPEAKER>JOAN LA PUCELLE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Away, captains! let's get us from the walls;</LINE>

<LINE>Vow, Burgundy, by honour of thy house,</LINE>
<LINE>Prick'd on by public wrongs sustain'd in France,</LINE>
<LINE>Either to get the town again or die:</LINE>
<LINE>And I, as sure as English Henry lives</LINE>
<LINE>And as his father here was conqueror,</LINE>
<LINE>As sure as in this late-betrayed town</LINE>
<LINE>Great Coeur-de-lion's heart was buried,</LINE>
<LINE>So sure I swear to get the town or die.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BURGUNDY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My vows are equal partners with thy vows.</LINE>

<LINE>We will bestow you in some better place,</LINE>
<LINE>Fitter for sickness and for crazy age.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEDFORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lord Talbot, do not so dishonour me:</LINE>
<LINE>Here will I sit before the walls of Rouen</LINE>
<LINE>And will be partner of your weal or woe.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>BURGUNDY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Courageous Bedford, let us now persuade you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEDFORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not to be gone from hence; for once I read</LINE>
<LINE>That stout Pendragon in his litter sick</LINE>
<LINE>Came to the field and vanquished his foes:</LINE>
<LINE>Methinks I should revive the soldiers' hearts,</LINE>
<LINE>Because I ever found them as myself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TALBOT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Undaunted spirit in a dying breast!</LINE>
<LINE>Then be it so: heavens keep old Bedford safe!</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TALBOT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thanks, gentle duke. But where is Pucelle now?</LINE>
<LINE>I think her old familiar is asleep:</LINE>
<LINE>Now where's the Bastard's braves, and Charles his gleeks?</LINE>
<LINE>What, all amort? Rouen hangs her head for grief</LINE>
<LINE>That such a valiant company are fled.</LINE>
<LINE>Now will we take some order in the town,</LINE>
<LINE>Placing therein some expert officers,</LINE>
<LINE>And then depart to Paris to the king,</LINE>
<LINE>For there young Henry with his nobles lie.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>BURGUNDY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What wills Lord Talbot pleaseth Burgundy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TALBOT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But yet, before we go, let's not forget</LINE>
<LINE>The noble Duke of Bedford late deceased,</LINE>
<LINE>But see his exequies fulfill'd in Rouen:</LINE>
<LINE>A braver soldier never couched lance,</LINE>
<LINE>A gentler heart did never sway in court;</LINE>
<LINE>But kings and mightiest potentates must die,</LINE>
<LINE>For that's the end of human misery.</LINE>

LA PUCELLE, and forces</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JOAN LA PUCELLE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Dismay not, princes, at this accident,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor grieve that Rouen is so recovered:</LINE>
<LINE>Care is no cure, but rather corrosive,</LINE>
<LINE>For things that are not to be remedied.</LINE>
<LINE>Let frantic Talbot triumph for a while</LINE>
<LINE>And like a peacock sweep along his tail;</LINE>
<LINE>We'll pull his plumes and take away his train,</LINE>
<LINE>If Dauphin and the rest will be but ruled.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We have been guided by thee hitherto,</LINE>
<LINE>And of thy cunning had no diffidence:</LINE>
<LINE>One sudden foil shall never breed distrust.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BASTARD OF ORLEANS</SPEAKER>

<LINE>Employ thee then, sweet virgin, for our good.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JOAN LA PUCELLE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then thus it must be; this doth Joan devise:</LINE>
<LINE>By fair persuasions mix'd with sugar'd words</LINE>
<LINE>We will entice the Duke of Burgundy</LINE>
<LINE>To leave the Talbot and to follow us.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, marry, sweeting, if we could do that,</LINE>
<LINE>France were no place for Henry's warriors;</LINE>
<LINE>Nor should that nation boast it so with us,</LINE>
<LINE>But be extirped from our provinces.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Your honours shall perceive how I will work</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Here sound an English march. Enter, and pass over

<LINE>There goes the Talbot, with his colours spread,</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>French march. Enter BURGUNDY and forces</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Now in the rearward comes the duke and his:</LINE>

<LINE>Look on thy country, look on fertile France,</LINE>
<LINE>And see the cities and the towns defaced</LINE>

<LINE>As looks the mother on her lowly babe</LINE>
<LINE>When death doth close his tender dying eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>See, see the pining malady of France;</LINE>
<LINE>Behold the wounds, the most unnatural wounds,</LINE>
<LINE>Which thou thyself hast given her woful breast.</LINE>
<LINE>O, turn thy edged sword another way;</LINE>
<LINE>Strike those that hurt, and hurt not those that help.</LINE>
<LINE>One drop of blood drawn from thy country's bosom</LINE>
<LINE>Should grieve thee more than streams of foreign gore:</LINE>
<LINE>Return thee therefore with a flood of tears,</LINE>
<LINE>And wash away thy country's stained spots.</LINE>

<LINE>Besides, all French and France exclaims on thee,</LINE>
<LINE>Doubting thy birth and lawful progeny.</LINE>
<LINE>Who joint'st thou with but with a lordly nation</LINE>
<LINE>That will not trust thee but for profit's sake?</LINE>
<LINE>When Talbot hath set footing once in France</LINE>
<LINE>And fashion'd thee that instrument of ill,</LINE>
<LINE>Who then but English Henry will be lord</LINE>
<LINE>And thou be thrust out like a fugitive?</LINE>
<LINE>Call we to mind, and mark but this for proof,</LINE>
<LINE>Was not the Duke of Orleans thy foe?</LINE>
<LINE>And was he not in England prisoner?</LINE>
<LINE>But when they heard he was thine enemy,</LINE>
<LINE>They set him free without his ransom paid,</LINE>
<LINE>In spite of Burgundy and all his friends.</LINE>
<LINE>See, then, thou fight'st against thy countrymen</LINE>
<LINE>And joint'st with them will be thy slaughtermen.</LINE>
<LINE>Come, come, return; return, thou wandering lord:</LINE>
<LINE>Charles and the rest will take thee in their arms.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BURGUNDY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am vanquished; these haughty words of hers</LINE>

<LINE>Forgive me, country, and sweet countrymen,</LINE>
<LINE>And, lords, accept this hearty kind embrace:</LINE>

<LINE>Darest thou maintain the former words thou spakest?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BASSET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, sir; as well as you dare patronage</LINE>
<LINE>The envious barking of your saucy tongue</LINE>
<LINE>Against my lord the Duke of Somerset.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VERNON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sirrah, thy lord I honour as he is.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BASSET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, what is he? as good a man as York.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VERNON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hark ye; not so: in witness, take ye that.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Strikes him</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BASSET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Villain, thou know'st the law of arms is such</LINE>
<LINE>That whoso draws a sword, 'tis present death,</LINE>
<LINE>Or else this blow should broach thy dearest blood.</LINE>
<LINE>But I'll unto his majesty, and crave</LINE>
<LINE>I may have liberty to venge this wrong;</LINE>
<LINE>When thou shalt see I'll meet thee to thy cost.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VERNON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, miscreant, I'll be there as soon as you;</LINE>
<LINE>And, after, meet you sooner than you would.</LINE>

<ACT><TITLE>ACT IV</TITLE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE I.  Paris. A hall of state.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter KING HENRY VI, GLOUCESTER, BISHOP OF
WINCHESTER, YORK, SUFFOLK, SOMERSET, WARWICK,
TALBOT, EXETER, the Governor, of Paris, and others</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lord bishop, set the crown upon his head.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BISHOP OF WINCHESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>God save King Henry, of that name the sixth!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, governor of Paris, take your oath,</LINE>
<LINE>That you elect no other king but him;</LINE>
<LINE>Esteem none friends but such as are his friends,</LINE>
<LINE>And none your foes but such as shall pretend</LINE>
<LINE>Malicious practises against his state:</LINE>
<LINE>This shall ye do, so help you righteous God!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter FASTOLFE</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FASTOLFE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My gracious sovereign, as I rode from Calais,</LINE>
<LINE>To haste unto your coronation,</LINE>
<LINE>A letter was deliver'd to my hands,</LINE>
<LINE>Writ to your grace from the Duke of Burgundy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TALBOT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Shame to the Duke of Burgundy and thee!</LINE>
<LINE>I vow'd, base knight, when I did meet thee next,</LINE>
<LINE>To tear the garter from thy craven's leg,</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Plucking it off</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Which I have done, because unworthily</LINE>
<LINE>Thou wast installed in that high degree.</LINE>
<LINE>Pardon me, princely Henry, and the rest</LINE>
<LINE>This dastard, at the battle of Patay,</LINE>
<LINE>When but in all I was six thousand strong</LINE>
<LINE>And that the French were almost ten to one,</LINE>
<LINE>Before we met or that a stroke was given,</LINE>
<LINE>Like to a trusty squire did run away:</LINE>
<LINE>In which assault we lost twelve hundred men;</LINE>
<LINE>Myself and divers gentlemen beside</LINE>
<LINE>Were there surprised and taken prisoners.</LINE>
<LINE>Then judge, great lords, if I have done amiss;</LINE>
<LINE>Or whether that such cowards ought to wear</LINE>
<LINE>This ornament of knighthood, yea or no.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To say the truth, this fact was infamous</LINE>
<LINE>And ill beseeming any common man,</LINE>
<LINE>Much more a knight, a captain and a leader.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TALBOT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>When first this order was ordain'd, my lords,</LINE>
<LINE>Knights of the garter were of noble birth,</LINE>
<LINE>Valiant and virtuous, full of haughty courage,</LINE>
<LINE>Such as were grown to credit by the wars;</LINE>
<LINE>Not fearing death, nor shrinking for distress,</LINE>
<LINE>But always resolute in most extremes.</LINE>
<LINE>He then that is not furnish'd in this sort</LINE>
<LINE>Doth but usurp the sacred name of knight,</LINE>
<LINE>Profaning this most honourable order,</LINE>
<LINE>And should, if I were worthy to be judge,</LINE>
<LINE>Be quite degraded, like a hedge-born swain</LINE>
<LINE>That doth presume to boast of gentle blood.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY VI</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Stain to thy countrymen, thou hear'st thy doom!</LINE>
<LINE>Be packing, therefore, thou that wast a knight:</LINE>
<LINE>Henceforth we banish thee, on pain of death.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit FASTOLFE</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>And now, my lord protector, view the letter</LINE>
<LINE>Sent from our uncle Duke of Burgundy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What means his grace, that he hath changed his style?</LINE>
<LINE>No more but, plain and bluntly, 'To the king!'</LINE>
<LINE>Hath he forgot he is his sovereign?</LINE>
<LINE>Or doth this churlish superscription</LINE>
<LINE>Pretend some alteration in good will?</LINE>
<LINE>What's here?</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Reads</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>'I have, upon especial cause,</LINE>
<LINE>Moved with compassion of my country's wreck,</LINE>
<LINE>Together with the pitiful complaints</LINE>
<LINE>Of such as your oppression feeds upon,</LINE>
<LINE>Forsaken your pernicious faction</LINE>
<LINE>And join'd with Charles, the rightful King of France.'</LINE>
<LINE>O monstrous treachery! can this be so,</LINE>
<LINE>That in alliance, amity and oaths,</LINE>
<LINE>There should be found such false dissembling guile?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY VI</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What! doth my uncle Burgundy revolt?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He doth, my lord, and is become your foe.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY VI</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is that the worst this letter doth contain?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is the worst, and all, my lord, he writes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY VI</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, then, Lord Talbot there shall talk with him</LINE>
<LINE>And give him chastisement for this abuse.</LINE>
<LINE>How say you, my lord? are you not content?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TALBOT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Content, my liege! yes, but that I am prevented,</LINE>
<LINE>I should have begg'd I might have been employ'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY VI</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then gather strength and march unto him straight:</LINE>
<LINE>Let him perceive how ill we brook his treason</LINE>
<LINE>And what offence it is to flout his friends.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TALBOT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I go, my lord, in heart desiring still</LINE>
<LINE>You may behold confusion of your foes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>Enter VERNON and BASSET</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VERNON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Grant me the combat, gracious sovereign.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BASSET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And me, my lord, grant me the combat too.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is my servant: hear him, noble prince.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SOMERSET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And this is mine: sweet Henry, favour him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY VI</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Be patient, lords; and give them leave to speak.</LINE>
<LINE>Say, gentlemen, what makes you thus exclaim?</LINE>
<LINE>And wherefore crave you combat? or with whom?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VERNON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With him, my lord; for he hath done me wrong.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BASSET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And I with him; for he hath done me wrong.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY VI</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What is that wrong whereof you both complain?</LINE>
<LINE>First let me know, and then I'll answer you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BASSET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Crossing the sea from England into France,</LINE>
<LINE>This fellow here, with envious carping tongue,</LINE>
<LINE>Upbraided me about the rose I wear;</LINE>
<LINE>Saying, the sanguine colour of the leaves</LINE>
<LINE>Did represent my master's blushing cheeks,</LINE>
<LINE>When stubbornly he did repugn the truth</LINE>
<LINE>About a certain question in the law</LINE>
<LINE>Argued betwixt the Duke of York and him;</LINE>
<LINE>With other vile and ignominious terms:</LINE>
<LINE>In confutation of which rude reproach</LINE>
<LINE>And in defence of my lord's worthiness,</LINE>
<LINE>I crave the benefit of law of arms.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VERNON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And that is my petition, noble lord:</LINE>
<LINE>For though he seem with forged quaint conceit</LINE>
<LINE>To set a gloss upon his bold intent,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet know, my lord, I was provoked by him;</LINE>
<LINE>And he first took exceptions at this badge,</LINE>
<LINE>Pronouncing that the paleness of this flower</LINE>
<LINE>Bewray'd the faintness of my master's heart.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Will not this malice, Somerset, be left?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SOMERSET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your private grudge, my Lord of York, will out,</LINE>
<LINE>Though ne'er so cunningly you smother it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY VI</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good Lord, what madness rules in brainsick men,</LINE>
<LINE>When for so slight and frivolous a cause</LINE>
<LINE>Such factious emulations shall arise!</LINE>
<LINE>Good cousins both, of York and Somerset,</LINE>
<LINE>Quiet yourselves, I pray, and be at peace.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let this dissension first be tried by fight,</LINE>
<LINE>And then your highness shall command a peace.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SOMERSET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The quarrel toucheth none but us alone;</LINE>
<LINE>Betwixt ourselves let us decide it then.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There is my pledge; accept it, Somerset.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VERNON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, let it rest where it began at first.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BASSET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Confirm it so, mine honourable lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Confirm it so! Confounded be your strife!</LINE>
<LINE>And perish ye, with your audacious prate!</LINE>
<LINE>Presumptuous vassals, are you not ashamed</LINE>
<LINE>With this immodest clamorous outrage</LINE>
<LINE>To trouble and disturb the king and us?</LINE>
<LINE>And you, my lords, methinks you do not well</LINE>
<LINE>To bear with their perverse objections;</LINE>
<LINE>Much less to take occasion from their mouths</LINE>
<LINE>To raise a mutiny betwixt yourselves:</LINE>
<LINE>Let me persuade you take a better course.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EXETER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It grieves his highness: good my lords, be friends.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY VI</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come hither, you that would be combatants:</LINE>
<LINE>Henceforth I charge you, as you love our favour,</LINE>
<LINE>Quite to forget this quarrel and the cause.</LINE>
<LINE>And you, my lords, remember where we are,</LINE>
<LINE>In France, amongst a fickle wavering nation:</LINE>
<LINE>If they perceive dissension in our looks</LINE>
<LINE>And that within ourselves we disagree,</LINE>
<LINE>How will their grudging stomachs be provoked</LINE>
<LINE>To wilful disobedience, and rebel!</LINE>
<LINE>Beside, what infamy will there arise,</LINE>
<LINE>When foreign princes shall be certified</LINE>
<LINE>That for a toy, a thing of no regard,</LINE>
<LINE>King Henry's peers and chief nobility</LINE>
<LINE>Destroy'd themselves, and lost the realm of France!</LINE>
<LINE>O, think upon the conquest of my father,</LINE>
<LINE>My tender years, and let us not forego</LINE>
<LINE>That for a trifle that was bought with blood</LINE>
<LINE>Let me be umpire in this doubtful strife.</LINE>
<LINE>I see no reason, if I wear this rose,</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Putting on a red rose</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>That any one should therefore be suspicious</LINE>
<LINE>I more incline to Somerset than York:</LINE>
<LINE>Both are my kinsmen, and I love them both:</LINE>
<LINE>As well they may upbraid me with my crown,</LINE>
<LINE>Because, forsooth, the king of Scots is crown'd.</LINE>
<LINE>But your discretions better can persuade</LINE>
<LINE>Than I am able to instruct or teach:</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore, as we hither came in peace,</LINE>
<LINE>So let us still continue peace and love.</LINE>
<LINE>Cousin of York, we institute your grace</LINE>
<LINE>To be our regent in these parts of France:</LINE>
<LINE>And, good my Lord of Somerset, unite</LINE>
<LINE>Your troops of horsemen with his bands of foot;</LINE>
<LINE>And, like true subjects, sons of your progenitors,</LINE>
<LINE>Go cheerfully together and digest.</LINE>
<LINE>Your angry choler on your enemies.</LINE>
<LINE>Ourself, my lord protector and the rest</LINE>
<LINE>After some respite will return to Calais;</LINE>
<LINE>From thence to England; where I hope ere long</LINE>
<LINE>To be presented, by your victories,</LINE>
<LINE>With Charles, Alencon and that traitorous rout.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Flourish. Exeunt all but YORK, WARWICK, EXETER
and VERNON</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WARWICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My Lord of York, I promise you, the king</LINE>
<LINE>Prettily, methought, did play the orator.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And so he did; but yet I like it not,</LINE>
<LINE>In that he wears the badge of Somerset.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WARWICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tush, that was but his fancy, blame him not;</LINE>
<LINE>I dare presume, sweet prince, he thought no harm.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>An if I wist he did,--but let it rest;</LINE>
<LINE>Other affairs must now be managed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt all but EXETER</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EXETER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well didst thou, Richard, to suppress thy voice;</LINE>
<LINE>For, had the passions of thy heart burst out,</LINE>
<LINE>I fear we should have seen decipher'd there</LINE>
<LINE>More rancorous spite, more furious raging broils,</LINE>
<LINE>Than yet can be imagined or supposed.</LINE>
<LINE>But howsoe'er, no simple man that sees</LINE>
<LINE>This jarring discord of nobility,</LINE>
<LINE>This shouldering of each other in the court,</LINE>
<LINE>This factious bandying of their favourites,</LINE>
<LINE>But that it doth presage some ill event.</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis much when sceptres are in children's hands;</LINE>
<LINE>But more when envy breeds unkind division;</LINE>
<LINE>There comes the rain, there begins confusion.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter TALBOT, with trump and drum</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TALBOT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go to the gates of Bourdeaux, trumpeter:</LINE>
<LINE>Summon their general unto the wall.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Trumpet sounds. Enter General and others, aloft</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>English John Talbot, captains, calls you forth,</LINE>
<LINE>Servant in arms to Harry King of England;</LINE>
<LINE>And thus he would: Open your city gates;</LINE>
<LINE>Be humble to us; call my sovereign yours,</LINE>
<LINE>And do him homage as obedient subjects;</LINE>
<LINE>And I'll withdraw me and my bloody power:</LINE>
<LINE>But, if you frown upon this proffer'd peace,</LINE>
<LINE>You tempt the fury of my three attendants,</LINE>
<LINE>Lean famine, quartering steel, and climbing fire;</LINE>
<LINE>Who in a moment even with the earth</LINE>
<LINE>Shall lay your stately and air-braving towers,</LINE>
<LINE>If you forsake the offer of their love.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>General</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou ominous and fearful owl of death,</LINE>
<LINE>Our nation's terror and their bloody scourge!</LINE>
<LINE>The period of thy tyranny approacheth.</LINE>
<LINE>On us thou canst not enter but by death;</LINE>
<LINE>For, I protest, we are well fortified</LINE>
<LINE>And strong enough to issue out and fight:</LINE>
<LINE>If thou retire, the Dauphin, well appointed,</LINE>
<LINE>Stands with the snares of war to tangle thee:</LINE>
<LINE>On either hand thee there are squadrons pitch'd,</LINE>
<LINE>To wall thee from the liberty of flight;</LINE>
<LINE>And no way canst thou turn thee for redress,</LINE>
<LINE>But death doth front thee with apparent spoil</LINE>
<LINE>And pale destruction meets thee in the face.</LINE>
<LINE>Ten thousand French have ta'en the sacrament</LINE>
<LINE>To rive their dangerous artillery</LINE>
<LINE>Upon no Christian soul but English Talbot.</LINE>
<LINE>Lo, there thou stand'st, a breathing valiant man,</LINE>
<LINE>Of an invincible unconquer'd spirit!</LINE>
<LINE>This is the latest glory of thy praise</LINE>
<LINE>That I, thy enemy, due thee withal;</LINE>
<LINE>For ere the glass, that now begins to run,</LINE>
<LINE>Finish the process of his sandy hour,</LINE>
<LINE>These eyes, that see thee now well coloured,</LINE>
<LINE>Shall see thee wither'd, bloody, pale and dead.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Drum afar off</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Hark! hark! the Dauphin's drum, a warning bell,</LINE>
<LINE>Sings heavy music to thy timorous soul;</LINE>
<LINE>And mine shall ring thy dire departure out.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt General, &amp;c</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TALBOT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He fables not; I hear the enemy:</LINE>
<LINE>Out, some light horsemen, and peruse their wings.</LINE>
<LINE>O, negligent and heedless discipline!</LINE>
<LINE>How are we park'd and bounded in a pale,</LINE>
<LINE>A little herd of England's timorous deer,</LINE>
<LINE>Mazed with a yelping kennel of French curs!</LINE>
<LINE>If we be English deer, be then in blood;</LINE>
<LINE>Not rascal-like, to fall down with a pinch,</LINE>
<LINE>But rather, moody-mad and desperate stags,</LINE>
<LINE>Turn on the bloody hounds with heads of steel</LINE>
<LINE>And make the cowards stand aloof at bay:</LINE>
<LINE>Sell every man his life as dear as mine,</LINE>
<LINE>And they shall find dear deer of us, my friends.</LINE>
<LINE>God and Saint George, Talbot and England's right,</LINE>
<LINE>Prosper our colours in this dangerous fight!</LINE>

<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They are return'd, my lord, and give it out</LINE>
<LINE>That he is march'd to Bourdeaux with his power,</LINE>
<LINE>To fight with Talbot: as he march'd along,</LINE>
<LINE>By your espials were discovered</LINE>
<LINE>Two mightier troops than that the Dauphin led,</LINE>
<LINE>Which join'd with him and made their march for Bourdeaux.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A plague upon that villain Somerset,</LINE>

<SPEAKER>LUCY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou princely leader of our English strength,</LINE>
<LINE>Never so needful on the earth of France,</LINE>
<LINE>Spur to the rescue of the noble Talbot,</LINE>
<LINE>Who now is girdled with a waist of iron</LINE>
<LINE>And hemm'd about with grim destruction:</LINE>
<LINE>To Bourdeaux, warlike duke! to Bourdeaux, York!</LINE>
<LINE>Else, farewell Talbot, France, and England's honour.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O God, that Somerset, who in proud heart</LINE>
<LINE>Doth stop my cornets, were in Talbot's place!</LINE>
<LINE>So should we save a valiant gentleman</LINE>
<LINE>By forfeiting a traitor and a coward.</LINE>
<LINE>Mad ire and wrathful fury makes me weep,</LINE>

<LINE>We mourn, France smiles; we lose, they daily get;</LINE>
<LINE>All 'long of this vile traitor Somerset.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>LUCY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then God take mercy on brave Talbot's soul;</LINE>
<LINE>And on his son young John, who two hours since</LINE>
<LINE>I met in travel toward his warlike father!</LINE>
<LINE>This seven years did not Talbot see his son;</LINE>

<LINE>Lucy, farewell; no more my fortune can,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SOMERSET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is too late; I cannot send them now:</LINE>
<LINE>This expedition was by York and Talbot</LINE>
<LINE>Too rashly plotted: all our general force</LINE>
<LINE>Might with a sally of the very town</LINE>
<LINE>Be buckled with: the over-daring Talbot</LINE>
<LINE>Hath sullied all his gloss of former honour</LINE>
<LINE>By this unheedful, desperate, wild adventure:</LINE>
<LINE>York set him on to fight and die in shame,</LINE>
<LINE>That, Talbot dead, great York might bear the name.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Whither, my lord? from bought and sold Lord Talbot;</LINE>
<LINE>Who, ring'd about with bold adversity,</LINE>
<LINE>Cries out for noble York and Somerset,</LINE>
<LINE>To beat assailing death from his weak legions:</LINE>
<LINE>And whiles the honourable captain there</LINE>
<LINE>Drops bloody sweat from his war-wearied limbs,</LINE>
<LINE>And, in advantage lingering, looks for rescue,</LINE>
<LINE>You, his false hopes, the trust of England's honour,</LINE>
<LINE>Keep off aloof with worthless emulation.</LINE>
<LINE>Let not your private discord keep away</LINE>
<LINE>The levied succors that should lend him aid,</LINE>
<LINE>While he, renowned noble gentleman,</LINE>
<LINE>Yields up his life unto a world of odds:</LINE>
<LINE>Orleans the Bastard, Charles, Burgundy,</LINE>
<LINE>Alencon, Reignier, compass him about,</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter TALBOT and JOHN his son</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TALBOT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O young John Talbot! I did send for thee</LINE>
<LINE>To tutor thee in stratagems of war,</LINE>
<LINE>That Talbot's name might be in thee revived</LINE>
<LINE>When sapless age and weak unable limbs</LINE>
<LINE>Should bring thy father to his drooping chair.</LINE>
<LINE>But, O malignant and ill-boding stars!</LINE>
<LINE>Now thou art come unto a feast of death,</LINE>
<LINE>A terrible and unavoided danger:</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore, dear boy, mount on my swiftest horse;</LINE>
<LINE>And I'll direct thee how thou shalt escape</LINE>
<LINE>By sudden flight: come, dally not, be gone.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JOHN TALBOT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is my name Talbot? and am I your son?</LINE>
<LINE>And shall I fly? O if you love my mother,</LINE>
<LINE>Dishonour not her honourable name,</LINE>
<LINE>To make a bastard and a slave of me!</LINE>
<LINE>The world will say, he is not Talbot's blood,</LINE>
<LINE>That basely fled when noble Talbot stood.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TALBOT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fly, to revenge my death, if I be slain.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JOHN TALBOT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He that flies so will ne'er return again.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>TALBOT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If we both stay, we both are sure to die.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JOHN TALBOT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then let me stay; and, father, do you fly:</LINE>
<LINE>Your loss is great, so your regard should be;</LINE>
<LINE>My worth unknown, no loss is known in me.</LINE>
<LINE>Upon my death the French can little boast;</LINE>
<LINE>In yours they will, in you all hopes are lost.</LINE>
<LINE>Flight cannot stain the honour you have won;</LINE>
<LINE>But mine it will, that no exploit have done:</LINE>
<LINE>You fled for vantage, everyone will swear;</LINE>
<LINE>But, if I bow, they'll say it was for fear.</LINE>
<LINE>There is no hope that ever I will stay,</LINE>
<LINE>If the first hour I shrink and run away.</LINE>
<LINE>Here on my knee I beg mortality,</LINE>
<LINE>Rather than life preserved with infamy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TALBOT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Shall all thy mother's hopes lie in one tomb?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JOHN TALBOT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, rather than I'll shame my mother's womb.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TALBOT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Upon my blessing, I command thee go.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Thy father's charge shall clear thee from that stain.</LINE>

<LINE>You cannot witness for me, being slain.</LINE>
<LINE>If death be so apparent, then both fly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TALBOT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And leave my followers here to fight and die?</LINE>
<LINE>My age was never tainted with such shame.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JOHN TALBOT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And shall my youth be guilty of such blame?</LINE>
<LINE>No more can I be sever'd from your side,</LINE>
<LINE>Than can yourself yourself in twain divide:</LINE>
<LINE>Stay, go, do what you will, the like do I;</LINE>
<LINE>For live I will not, if my father die.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TALBOT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then here I take my leave of thee, fair son,</LINE>
<LINE>Born to eclipse thy life this afternoon.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>TALBOT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Saint George and victory! fight, soldiers, fight.</LINE>
<LINE>The regent hath with Talbot broke his word</LINE>
<LINE>And left us to the rage of France his sword.</LINE>
<LINE>Where is John Talbot? Pause, and take thy breath;</LINE>
<LINE>I gave thee life and rescued thee from death.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JOHN TALBOT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, twice my father, twice am I thy son!</LINE>
<LINE>The life thou gavest me first was lost and done,</LINE>
<LINE>Till with thy warlike sword, despite of late,</LINE>
<LINE>To my determined time thou gavest new date.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TALBOT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>When from the Dauphin's crest thy sword struck fire,</LINE>
<LINE>It warm'd thy father's heart with proud desire</LINE>
<LINE>Of bold-faced victory. Then leaden age,</LINE>
<LINE>Quicken'd with youthful spleen and warlike rage,</LINE>
<LINE>Beat down Alencon, Orleans, Burgundy,</LINE>
<LINE>And from the pride of Gallia rescued thee.</LINE>
<LINE>The ireful bastard Orleans, that drew blood</LINE>
<LINE>From thee, my boy, and had the maidenhood</LINE>
<LINE>Of thy first fight, I soon encountered,</LINE>
<LINE>And interchanging blows I quickly shed</LINE>
<LINE>Some of his bastard blood; and in disgrace</LINE>
<LINE>Bespoke him thus; 'Contaminated, base</LINE>
<LINE>And misbegotten blood I spill of thine,</LINE>
<LINE>Mean and right poor, for that pure blood of mine</LINE>
<LINE>Which thou didst force from Talbot, my brave boy:'</LINE>
<LINE>Here, purposing the Bastard to destroy,</LINE>
<LINE>Came in strong rescue. Speak, thy father's care,</LINE>
<LINE>Art thou not weary, John? how dost thou fare?</LINE>
<LINE>Wilt thou yet leave the battle, boy, and fly,</LINE>
<LINE>Now thou art seal'd the son of chivalry?</LINE>
<LINE>Fly, to revenge my death when I am dead:</LINE>
<LINE>The help of one stands me in little stead.</LINE>
<LINE>O, too much folly is it, well I wot,</LINE>
<LINE>To hazard all our lives in one small boat!</LINE>
<LINE>If I to-day die not with Frenchmen's rage,</LINE>
<LINE>To-morrow I shall die with mickle age:</LINE>
<LINE>By me they nothing gain an if I stay;</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis but the shortening of my life one day:</LINE>
<LINE>In thee thy mother dies, our household's name,</LINE>
<LINE>My death's revenge, thy youth, and England's fame:</LINE>
<LINE>All these and more we hazard by thy stay;</LINE>
<LINE>All these are saved if thou wilt fly away.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JOHN TALBOT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The sword of Orleans hath not made me smart;</LINE>
<LINE>These words of yours draw life-blood from my heart:</LINE>
<LINE>On that advantage, bought with such a shame,</LINE>
<LINE>To save a paltry life and slay bright fame,</LINE>
<LINE>Before young Talbot from old Talbot fly,</LINE>
<LINE>The coward horse that bears me fail and die!</LINE>
<LINE>And like me to the peasant boys of France,</LINE>
<LINE>To be shame's scorn and subject of mischance!</LINE>
<LINE>Surely, by all the glory you have won,</LINE>
<LINE>An if I fly, I am not Talbot's son:</LINE>
<LINE>Then talk no more of flight, it is no boot;</LINE>
<LINE>If son to Talbot, die at Talbot's foot.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TALBOT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then follow thou thy desperate sire of Crete,</LINE>

<LINE>O, where's young Talbot? where is valiant John?</LINE>
<LINE>Triumphant death, smear'd with captivity,</LINE>
<LINE>Young Talbot's valour makes me smile at thee:</LINE>
<LINE>When he perceived me shrink and on my knee,</LINE>
<LINE>His bloody sword he brandish'd over me,</LINE>
<LINE>And, like a hungry lion, did commence</LINE>
<LINE>Rough deeds of rage and stern impatience;</LINE>
<LINE>But when my angry guardant stood alone,</LINE>
<LINE>Tendering my ruin and assail'd of none,</LINE>
<LINE>Dizzy-eyed fury and great rage of heart</LINE>
<LINE>Suddenly made him from my side to start</LINE>
<LINE>Into the clustering battle of the French;</LINE>
<LINE>And in that sea of blood my boy did drench</LINE>
<LINE>His over-mounting spirit, and there died,</LINE>
<LINE>My Icarus, my blossom, in his pride.</LINE>

<LINE>O, thou, whose wounds become hard-favour'd death,</LINE>
<LINE>Speak to thy father ere thou yield thy breath!</LINE>
<LINE>Brave death by speaking, whether he will or no;</LINE>
<LINE>Imagine him a Frenchman and thy foe.</LINE>
<LINE>Poor boy! he smiles, methinks, as who should say,</LINE>

<LINE>Come, come and lay him in his father's arms:</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JOAN LA PUCELLE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Once I encounter'd him, and thus I said:</LINE>
<LINE>'Thou maiden youth, be vanquish'd by a maid:'</LINE>
<LINE>But, with a proud majestical high scorn,</LINE>
<LINE>He answer'd thus: 'Young Talbot was not born</LINE>
<LINE>To be the pillage of a giglot wench:'</LINE>
<LINE>So, rushing in the bowels of the French,</LINE>
<LINE>He left me proudly, as unworthy fight.</LINE>

<LINE>O, that I could but call these dead to life!</LINE>
<LINE>It were enough to fright the realm of France:</LINE>
<LINE>Were but his picture left amongst you here,</LINE>
<LINE>It would amaze the proudest of you all.</LINE>
<LINE>Give me their bodies, that I may bear them hence</LINE>
<LINE>And give them burial as beseems their worth.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>They hang their heads</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>No hope to have redress? My body shall</LINE>
<LINE>Pay recompense, if you will grant my suit.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>They shake their heads</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Cannot my body nor blood-sacrifice</LINE>
<LINE>Entreat you to your wonted furtherance?</LINE>
<LINE>Then take my soul, my body, soul and all,</LINE>
<LINE>Before that England give the French the foil.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>They depart</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>See, they forsake me! Now the time is come</LINE>
<LINE>That France must vail her lofty-plumed crest</LINE>
<LINE>And let her head fall into England's lap.</LINE>
<LINE>My ancient incantations are too weak,</LINE>
<LINE>And hell too strong for me to buckle with:</LINE>
<LINE>Now, France, thy glory droopeth to the dust.</LINE>

<LINE>Damsel of France, I think I have you fast:</LINE>
<LINE>Unchain your spirits now with spelling charms</LINE>

<LINE>A goodly prize, fit for the devil's grace!</LINE>
<LINE>See, how the ugly wench doth bend her brows,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Be what thou wilt, thou art my prisoner.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Gazes on her</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>O fairest beauty, do not fear nor fly!</LINE>
<LINE>For I will touch thee but with reverent hands;</LINE>
<LINE>I kiss these fingers for eternal peace,</LINE>
<LINE>And lay them gently on thy tender side.</LINE>
<LINE>Who art thou? say, that I may honour thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Margaret my name, and daughter to a king,</LINE>
<LINE>The King of Naples, whosoe'er thou art.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>An earl I am, and Suffolk am I call'd.</LINE>
<LINE>Be not offended, nature's miracle,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou art allotted to be ta'en by me:</LINE>
<LINE>So doth the swan her downy cygnets save,</LINE>
<LINE>Keeping them prisoner underneath her wings.</LINE>
<LINE>Yet, if this servile usage once offend.</LINE>
<LINE>Go, and be free again, as Suffolk's friend.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>She is going</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>O, stay! I have no power to let her pass;</LINE>
<LINE>My hand would free her, but my heart says no</LINE>
<LINE>As plays the sun upon the glassy streams,</LINE>
<LINE>Twinkling another counterfeited beam,</LINE>
<LINE>So seems this gorgeous beauty to mine eyes.</LINE>
<LINE>Fain would I woo her, yet I dare not speak:</LINE>
<LINE>I'll call for pen and ink, and write my mind.</LINE>
<LINE>Fie, de la Pole! disable not thyself;</LINE>
<LINE>Hast not a tongue? is she not here?</LINE>
<LINE>Wilt thou be daunted at a woman's sight?</LINE>
<LINE>Ay, beauty's princely majesty is such,</LINE>
<LINE>Confounds the tongue and makes the senses rough.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Say, Earl of Suffolk--if thy name be so--</LINE>
<LINE>What ransom must I pay before I pass?</LINE>
<LINE>For I perceive I am thy prisoner.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How canst thou tell she will deny thy suit,</LINE>
<LINE>Before thou make a trial of her love?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why speak'st thou not? what ransom must I pay?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She's beautiful, and therefore to be woo'd;</LINE>
<LINE>She is a woman, therefore to be won.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Wilt thou accept of ransom? yea, or no.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fond man, remember that thou hast a wife;</LINE>
<LINE>Then how can Margaret be thy paramour?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I were best to leave him, for he will not hear.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There all is marr'd; there lies a cooling card.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He talks at random; sure, the man is mad.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And yet a dispensation may be had.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And yet I would that you would answer me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll win this Lady Margaret. For whom?</LINE>
<LINE>Why, for my king: tush, that's a wooden thing!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He talks of wood: it is some carpenter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yet so my fancy may be satisfied,</LINE>
<LINE>And peace established between these realms</LINE>
<LINE>But there remains a scruple in that too;</LINE>
<LINE>For though her father be the King of Naples,</LINE>
<LINE>Duke of Anjou and Maine, yet is he poor,</LINE>
<LINE>And our nobility will scorn the match.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hear ye, captain, are you not at leisure?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It shall be so, disdain they ne'er so much.</LINE>
<LINE>Henry is youthful and will quickly yield.</LINE>
<LINE>Madam, I have a secret to reveal.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What though I be enthrall'd? he seems a knight,</LINE>
<LINE>And will not any way dishonour me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lady, vouchsafe to listen what I say.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Perhaps I shall be rescued by the French;</LINE>
<LINE>And then I need not crave his courtesy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sweet madam, give me a hearing in a cause--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tush, women have been captivate ere now.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lady, wherefore talk you so?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I cry you mercy, 'tis but Quid for Quo.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Say, gentle princess, would you not suppose</LINE>
<LINE>Your bondage happy, to be made a queen?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To be a queen in bondage is more vile</LINE>
<LINE>Than is a slave in base servility;</LINE>
<LINE>For princes should be free.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And so shall you,</LINE>
<LINE>If happy England's royal king be free.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, what concerns his freedom unto me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll undertake to make thee Henry's queen,</LINE>
<LINE>To put a golden sceptre in thy hand</LINE>
<LINE>And set a precious crown upon thy head,</LINE>
<LINE>If thou wilt condescend to be my--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>His love.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am unworthy to be Henry's wife.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, gentle madam; I unworthy am</LINE>
<LINE>To woo so fair a dame to be his wife,</LINE>
<LINE>And have no portion in the choice myself.</LINE>
<LINE>How say you, madam, are ye so content?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>An if my father please, I am content.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then call our captains and our colours forth.</LINE>
<LINE>And, madam, at your father's castle walls</LINE>
<LINE>We'll crave a parley, to confer with him.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>A parley sounded. Enter REIGNIER on the walls</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>See, Reignier, see, thy daughter prisoner!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REIGNIER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To whom?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REIGNIER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Suffolk, what remedy?</LINE>
<LINE>I am a soldier, and unapt to weep,</LINE>
<LINE>Or to exclaim on fortune's fickleness.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, there is remedy enough, my lord:</LINE>
<LINE>Consent, and for thy honour give consent,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy daughter shall be wedded to my king;</LINE>
<LINE>Whom I with pain have woo'd and won thereto;</LINE>
<LINE>And this her easy-held imprisonment</LINE>
<LINE>Hath gained thy daughter princely liberty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REIGNIER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Speaks Suffolk as he thinks?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fair Margaret knows</LINE>
<LINE>That Suffolk doth not flatter, face, or feign.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REIGNIER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Upon thy princely warrant, I descend</LINE>
<LINE>To give thee answer of thy just demand.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit from the walls</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And here I will expect thy coming.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Trumpets sound. Enter REIGNIER, below</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Welcome, brave earl, into our territories:</LINE>
<LINE>Command in Anjou what your honour pleases.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thanks, Reignier, happy for so sweet a child,</LINE>
<LINE>Fit to be made companion with a king:</LINE>
<LINE>What answer makes your grace unto my suit?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REIGNIER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Since thou dost deign to woo her little worth</LINE>
<LINE>To be the princely bride of such a lord;</LINE>
<LINE>Upon condition I may quietly</LINE>
<LINE>Enjoy mine own, the country Maine and Anjou,</LINE>
<LINE>Free from oppression or the stroke of war,</LINE>
<LINE>My daughter shall be Henry's, if he please.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That is her ransom; I deliver her;</LINE>
<LINE>And those two counties I will undertake</LINE>
<LINE>Your grace shall well and quietly enjoy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REIGNIER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And I again, in Henry's royal name,</LINE>
<LINE>As deputy unto that gracious king,</LINE>
<LINE>Give thee her hand, for sign of plighted faith.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Reignier of France, I give thee kingly thanks,</LINE>
<LINE>Because this is in traffic of a king.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>And yet, methinks, I could be well content</LINE>
<LINE>To be mine own attorney in this case.</LINE>
<LINE>I'll over then to England with this news,</LINE>
<LINE>And make this marriage to be solemnized.</LINE>
<LINE>So farewell, Reignier: set this diamond safe</LINE>
<LINE>In golden palaces, as it becomes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REIGNIER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do embrace thee, as I would embrace</LINE>
<LINE>The Christian prince, King Henry, were he here.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Farewell, my lord: good wishes, praise and prayers</LINE>
<LINE>Shall Suffolk ever have of Margaret.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Going</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Farewell, sweet madam: but hark you, Margaret;</LINE>
<LINE>No princely commendations to my king?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Such commendations as becomes a maid,</LINE>
<LINE>A virgin and his servant, say to him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Words sweetly placed and modestly directed.</LINE>
<LINE>But madam, I must trouble you again;</LINE>
<LINE>No loving token to his majesty?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, my good lord, a pure unspotted heart,</LINE>
<LINE>Never yet taint with love, I send the king.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And this withal.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Kisses her</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That for thyself: I will not so presume</LINE>
<LINE>To send such peevish tokens to a king.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt REIGNIER and MARGARET</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, wert thou for myself! But, Suffolk, stay;</LINE>
<LINE>Thou mayst not wander in that labyrinth;</LINE>
<LINE>There Minotaurs and ugly treasons lurk.</LINE>
<LINE>Solicit Henry with her wondrous praise:</LINE>
<LINE>Bethink thee on her virtues that surmount,</LINE>
<LINE>And natural graces that extinguish art;</LINE>
<LINE>Repeat their semblance often on the seas,</LINE>
<LINE>That, when thou comest to kneel at Henry's feet,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou mayst bereave him of his wits with wonder.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter YORK, WARWICK, and others</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Bring forth that sorceress condemn'd to burn.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter JOAN LA PUCELLE, guarded, and a Shepherd</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Shepherd</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ah, Joan, this kills thy father's heart outright!</LINE>
<LINE>Have I sought every country far and near,</LINE>
<LINE>And, now it is my chance to find thee out,</LINE>
<LINE>Must I behold thy timeless cruel death?</LINE>
<LINE>Ah, Joan, sweet daughter Joan, I'll die with thee!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JOAN LA PUCELLE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Decrepit miser! base ignoble wretch!</LINE>
<LINE>I am descended of a gentler blood:</LINE>
<LINE>Thou art no father nor no friend of mine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Shepherd</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Out, out! My lords, an please you, 'tis not so;</LINE>
<LINE>I did beget her, all the parish knows:</LINE>
<LINE>Her mother liveth yet, can testify</LINE>
<LINE>She was the first fruit of my bachelorship.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WARWICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Graceless! wilt thou deny thy parentage?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This argues what her kind of life hath been,</LINE>
<LINE>Wicked and vile; and so her death concludes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Shepherd</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fie, Joan, that thou wilt be so obstacle!</LINE>
<LINE>God knows thou art a collop of my flesh;</LINE>
<LINE>And for thy sake have I shed many a tear:</LINE>
<LINE>Deny me not, I prithee, gentle Joan.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JOAN LA PUCELLE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Peasant, avaunt! You have suborn'd this man,</LINE>
<LINE>Of purpose to obscure my noble birth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Shepherd</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis true, I gave a noble to the priest</LINE>
<LINE>The morn that I was wedded to her mother.</LINE>
<LINE>Kneel down and take my blessing, good my girl.</LINE>
<LINE>Wilt thou not stoop? Now cursed be the time</LINE>
<LINE>Of thy nativity! I would the milk</LINE>
<LINE>Thy mother gave thee when thou suck'dst her breast,</LINE>
<LINE>Had been a little ratsbane for thy sake!</LINE>
<LINE>Or else, when thou didst keep my lambs a-field,</LINE>
<LINE>I wish some ravenous wolf had eaten thee!</LINE>
<LINE>Dost thou deny thy father, cursed drab?</LINE>
<LINE>O, burn her, burn her! hanging is too good.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Take her away; for she hath lived too long,</LINE>
<LINE>To fill the world with vicious qualities.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JOAN LA PUCELLE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>First, let me tell you whom you have condemn'd:</LINE>
<LINE>Not me begotten of a shepherd swain,</LINE>
<LINE>But issued from the progeny of kings;</LINE>
<LINE>Virtuous and holy; chosen from above,</LINE>
<LINE>By inspiration of celestial grace,</LINE>
<LINE>To work exceeding miracles on earth.</LINE>
<LINE>I never had to do with wicked spirits:</LINE>
<LINE>But you, that are polluted with your lusts,</LINE>
<LINE>Stain'd with the guiltless blood of innocents,</LINE>
<LINE>Corrupt and tainted with a thousand vices,</LINE>
<LINE>Because you want the grace that others have,</LINE>
<LINE>You judge it straight a thing impossible</LINE>
<LINE>To compass wonders but by help of devils.</LINE>
<LINE>No, misconceived! Joan of Arc hath been</LINE>
<LINE>A virgin from her tender infancy,</LINE>
<LINE>Chaste and immaculate in very thought;</LINE>
<LINE>Whose maiden blood, thus rigorously effused,</LINE>
<LINE>Will cry for vengeance at the gates of heaven.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, ay: away with her to execution!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WARWICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And hark ye, sirs; because she is a maid,</LINE>
<LINE>Spare for no faggots, let there be enow:</LINE>
<LINE>Place barrels of pitch upon the fatal stake,</LINE>
<LINE>That so her torture may be shortened.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JOAN LA PUCELLE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Will nothing turn your unrelenting hearts?</LINE>
<LINE>Then, Joan, discover thine infirmity,</LINE>
<LINE>That warranteth by law to be thy privilege.</LINE>
<LINE>I am with child, ye bloody homicides:</LINE>
<LINE>Murder not then the fruit within my womb,</LINE>
<LINE>Although ye hale me to a violent death.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now heaven forfend! the holy maid with child!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WARWICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The greatest miracle that e'er ye wrought:</LINE>
<LINE>Is all your strict preciseness come to this?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She and the Dauphin have been juggling:</LINE>
<LINE>I did imagine what would be her refuge.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WARWICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, go to; we'll have no bastards live;</LINE>
<LINE>Especially since Charles must father it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JOAN LA PUCELLE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You are deceived; my child is none of his:</LINE>
<LINE>It was Alencon that enjoy'd my love.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alencon! that notorious Machiavel!</LINE>
<LINE>It dies, an if it had a thousand lives.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JOAN LA PUCELLE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, give me leave, I have deluded you:</LINE>
<LINE>'Twas neither Charles nor yet the duke I named,</LINE>
<LINE>But Reignier, king of Naples, that prevail'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WARWICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A married man! that's most intolerable.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, here's a girl! I think she knows not well,</LINE>
<LINE>There were so many, whom she may accuse.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WARWICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It's sign she hath been liberal and free.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And yet, forsooth, she is a virgin pure.</LINE>
<LINE>Strumpet, thy words condemn thy brat and thee:</LINE>
<LINE>Use no entreaty, for it is in vain.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JOAN LA PUCELLE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then lead me hence; with whom I leave my curse:</LINE>
<LINE>May never glorious sun reflex his beams</LINE>
<LINE>Upon the country where you make abode;</LINE>
<LINE>But darkness and the gloomy shade of death</LINE>
<LINE>Environ you, till mischief and despair</LINE>
<LINE>Drive you to break your necks or hang yourselves!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit, guarded</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CARDINAL OF WINCHESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lord regent, I do greet your excellence</LINE>
<LINE>With letters of commission from the king.</LINE>
<LINE>For know, my lords, the states of Christendom,</LINE>
<LINE>Moved with remorse of these outrageous broils,</LINE>
<LINE>Have earnestly implored a general peace</LINE>
<LINE>Betwixt our nation and the aspiring French;</LINE>
<LINE>And here at hand the Dauphin and his train</LINE>
<LINE>Approacheth, to confer about some matter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is all our travail turn'd to this effect?</LINE>
<LINE>After the slaughter of so many peers,</LINE>
<LINE>So many captains, gentlemen and soldiers,</LINE>
<LINE>That in this quarrel have been overthrown</LINE>
<LINE>And sold their bodies for their country's benefit,</LINE>
<LINE>Shall we at last conclude effeminate peace?</LINE>
<LINE>Have we not lost most part of all the towns,</LINE>
<LINE>By treason, falsehood and by treachery,</LINE>
<LINE>Our great progenitors had conquered?</LINE>
<LINE>O Warwick, Warwick! I foresee with grief</LINE>
<LINE>The utter loss of all the realm of France.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WARWICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Be patient, York: if we conclude a peace,</LINE>
<LINE>It shall be with such strict and severe covenants</LINE>
<LINE>As little shall the Frenchmen gain thereby.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter CHARLES, ALENCON, BASTARD OF ORLEANS,

<LINE>Speak, Winchester; for boiling choler chokes</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CARDINAL OF WINCHESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Charles, and the rest, it is enacted thus:</LINE>
<LINE>That, in regard King Henry gives consent,</LINE>
<LINE>Of mere compassion and of lenity,</LINE>
<LINE>To ease your country of distressful war,</LINE>
<LINE>And suffer you to breathe in fruitful peace,</LINE>
<LINE>You shall become true liegemen to his crown:</LINE>
<LINE>And Charles, upon condition thou wilt swear</LINE>
<LINE>To pay him tribute, submit thyself,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou shalt be placed as viceroy under him,</LINE>
<LINE>And still enjoy thy regal dignity.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALENCON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Must he be then as shadow of himself?</LINE>
<LINE>Adorn his temples with a coronet,</LINE>
<LINE>And yet, in substance and authority,</LINE>
<LINE>Retain but privilege of a private man?</LINE>
<LINE>This proffer is absurd and reasonless.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis known already that I am possess'd</LINE>
<LINE>With more than half the Gallian territories,</LINE>
<LINE>And therein reverenced for their lawful king:</LINE>
<LINE>Shall I, for lucre of the rest unvanquish'd,</LINE>
<LINE>Detract so much from that prerogative,</LINE>
<LINE>As to be call'd but viceroy of the whole?</LINE>
<LINE>No, lord ambassador, I'll rather keep</LINE>
<LINE>That which I have than, coveting for more,</LINE>
<LINE>Be cast from possibility of all.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Insulting Charles! hast thou by secret means</LINE>
<LINE>Used intercession to obtain a league,</LINE>
<LINE>And, now the matter grows to compromise,</LINE>
<LINE>Stand'st thou aloof upon comparison?</LINE>
<LINE>Either accept the title thou usurp'st,</LINE>
<LINE>Of benefit proceeding from our king</LINE>
<LINE>And not of any challenge of desert,</LINE>
<LINE>Or we will plague thee with incessant wars.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REIGNIER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, you do not well in obstinacy</LINE>
<LINE>To cavil in the course of this contract:</LINE>
<LINE>If once it be neglected, ten to one</LINE>
<LINE>We shall not find like opportunity.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALENCON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To say the truth, it is your policy</LINE>
<LINE>To save your subjects from such massacre</LINE>
<LINE>And ruthless slaughters as are daily seen</LINE>
<LINE>By our proceeding in hostility;</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore take this compact of a truce,</LINE>
<LINE>Although you break it when your pleasure serves.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WARWICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How say'st thou, Charles? shall our condition stand?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It shall;</LINE>
<LINE>Only reserved, you claim no interest</LINE>
<LINE>In any of our towns of garrison.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then swear allegiance to his majesty,</LINE>
<LINE>As thou art knight, never to disobey</LINE>
<LINE>Nor be rebellious to the crown of England,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou, nor thy nobles, to the crown of England.</LINE>
<LINE>So, now dismiss your army when ye please:</LINE>
<LINE>Hang up your ensign, let your drums be still,</LINE>
<LINE>For here we entertain a solemn peace.</LINE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE V.  London. The palace.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter SUFFOLK in conference with KING HENRY VI,
GLOUCESTER and EXETER</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY VI</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your wondrous rare description, noble earl,</LINE>
<LINE>Of beauteous Margaret hath astonish'd me:</LINE>
<LINE>Her virtues graced with external gifts</LINE>
<LINE>Do breed love's settled passions in my heart:</LINE>
<LINE>And like as rigor of tempestuous gusts</LINE>
<LINE>Provokes the mightiest hulk against the tide,</LINE>
<LINE>So am I driven by breath of her renown</LINE>
<LINE>Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive</LINE>
<LINE>Where I may have fruition of her love.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tush, my good lord, this superficial tale</LINE>
<LINE>Is but a preface of her worthy praise;</LINE>
<LINE>The chief perfections of that lovely dame</LINE>
<LINE>Had I sufficient skill to utter them,</LINE>
<LINE>Would make a volume of enticing lines,</LINE>
<LINE>Able to ravish any dull conceit:</LINE>
<LINE>And, which is more, she is not so divine,</LINE>
<LINE>So full-replete with choice of all delights,</LINE>
<LINE>But with as humble lowliness of mind</LINE>
<LINE>She is content to be at your command;</LINE>
<LINE>Command, I mean, of virtuous chaste intents,</LINE>
<LINE>To love and honour Henry as her lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY VI</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And otherwise will Henry ne'er presume.</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore, my lord protector, give consent</LINE>
<LINE>That Margaret may be England's royal queen.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So should I give consent to flatter sin.</LINE>
<LINE>You know, my lord, your highness is betroth'd</LINE>
<LINE>Unto another lady of esteem:</LINE>
<LINE>How shall we then dispense with that contract,</LINE>
<LINE>And not deface your honour with reproach?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As doth a ruler with unlawful oaths;</LINE>
<LINE>Or one that, at a triumph having vow'd</LINE>
<LINE>To try his strength, forsaketh yet the lists</LINE>
<LINE>By reason of his adversary's odds:</LINE>
<LINE>A poor earl's daughter is unequal odds,</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore may be broke without offence.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, what, I pray, is Margaret more than that?</LINE>
<LINE>Her father is no better than an earl,</LINE>
<LINE>Although in glorious titles he excel.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, lord, her father is a king,</LINE>
<LINE>The King of Naples and Jerusalem;</LINE>
<LINE>And of such great authority in France</LINE>
<LINE>As his alliance will confirm our peace</LINE>
<LINE>And keep the Frenchmen in allegiance.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And so the Earl of Armagnac may do,</LINE>
<LINE>Because he is near kinsman unto Charles.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EXETER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Beside, his wealth doth warrant a liberal dower,</LINE>
<LINE>Where Reignier sooner will receive than give.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A dower, my lords! disgrace not so your king,</LINE>
<LINE>That he should be so abject, base and poor,</LINE>
<LINE>To choose for wealth and not for perfect love.</LINE>
<LINE>Henry is able to enrich his queen</LINE>
<LINE>And not seek a queen to make him rich:</LINE>
<LINE>So worthless peasants bargain for their wives,</LINE>
<LINE>As market-men for oxen, sheep, or horse.</LINE>
<LINE>Marriage is a matter of more worth</LINE>
<LINE>Than to be dealt in by attorneyship;</LINE>
<LINE>Not whom we will, but whom his grace affects,</LINE>
<LINE>Must be companion of his nuptial bed:</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore, lords, since he affects her most,</LINE>
<LINE>It most of all these reasons bindeth us,</LINE>
<LINE>In our opinions she should be preferr'd.</LINE>
<LINE>For what is wedlock forced but a hell,</LINE>
<LINE>An age of discord and continual strife?</LINE>
<LINE>Whereas the contrary bringeth bliss,</LINE>
<LINE>And is a pattern of celestial peace.</LINE>
<LINE>Whom should we match with Henry, being a king,</LINE>
<LINE>But Margaret, that is daughter to a king?</LINE>
<LINE>Her peerless feature, joined with her birth,</LINE>
<LINE>Approves her fit for none but for a king:</LINE>
<LINE>Her valiant courage and undaunted spirit,</LINE>
<LINE>More than in women commonly is seen,</LINE>
<LINE>Will answer our hope in issue of a king;</LINE>
<LINE>For Henry, son unto a conqueror,</LINE>
<LINE>Is likely to beget more conquerors,</LINE>
<LINE>If with a lady of so high resolve</LINE>
<LINE>As is fair Margaret he be link'd in love.</LINE>
<LINE>Then yield, my lords; and here conclude with me</LINE>
<LINE>That Margaret shall be queen, and none but she.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY VI</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Whether it be through force of your report,</LINE>
<LINE>My noble Lord of Suffolk, or for that</LINE>
<LINE>My tender youth was never yet attaint</LINE>
<LINE>With any passion of inflaming love,</LINE>
<LINE>I cannot tell; but this I am assured,</LINE>
<LINE>I feel such sharp dissension in my breast,</LINE>
<LINE>Such fierce alarums both of hope and fear,</LINE>
<LINE>As I am sick with working of my thoughts.</LINE>
<LINE>Take, therefore, shipping; post, my lord, to France;</LINE>
<LINE>Agree to any covenants, and procure</LINE>
<LINE>That Lady Margaret do vouchsafe to come</LINE>
<LINE>To cross the seas to England and be crown'd</LINE>
<LINE>King Henry's faithful and anointed queen:</LINE>
<LINE>For your expenses and sufficient charge,</LINE>
<LINE>Among the people gather up a tenth.</LINE>
<LINE>Be gone, I say; for, till you do return,</LINE>
<LINE>I rest perplexed with a thousand cares.</LINE>
<LINE>And you, good uncle, banish all offence:</LINE>
<LINE>If you do censure me by what you were,</LINE>
<LINE>Not what you are, I know it will excuse</LINE>
<LINE>This sudden execution of my will.</LINE>
<LINE>And so, conduct me where, from company,</LINE>
<LINE>I may revolve and ruminate my grief.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, grief, I fear me, both at first and last.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt GLOUCESTER and EXETER</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thus Suffolk hath prevail'd; and thus he goes,</LINE>
<LINE>As did the youthful Paris once to Greece,</LINE>
<LINE>With hope to find the like event in love,</LINE>
<LINE>But prosper better than the Trojan did.</LINE>
<LINE>Margaret shall now be queen, and rule the king;</LINE>
<LINE>But I will rule both her, the king and realm.</LINE>
