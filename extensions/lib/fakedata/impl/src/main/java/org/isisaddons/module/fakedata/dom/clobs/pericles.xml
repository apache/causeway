<STAGEDIR>Before the palace of Antioch</STAGEDIR>
<SPEECH><SPEAKER>[GOWER]</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To sing a song that old was sung,</LINE>
<LINE>From ashes ancient Gower is come;</LINE>
<LINE>Assuming man's infirmities,</LINE>
<LINE>To glad your ear, and please your eyes.</LINE>
<LINE>It hath been sung at festivals,</LINE>
<LINE>On ember-eves and holy-ales;</LINE>
<LINE>And lords and ladies in their lives</LINE>
<LINE>Have read it for restoratives:</LINE>
<LINE>The purchase is to make men glorious;</LINE>
<LINE>Et bonum quo antiquius, eo melius.</LINE>
<LINE>If you, born in these latter times,</LINE>
<LINE>When wit's more ripe, accept my rhymes.</LINE>
<LINE>And that to hear an old man sing</LINE>
<LINE>May to your wishes pleasure bring</LINE>
<LINE>I life would wish, and that I might</LINE>
<LINE>Waste it for you, like taper-light.</LINE>
<LINE>This Antioch, then, Antiochus the Great</LINE>
<LINE>Built up, this city, for his chiefest seat:</LINE>
<LINE>The fairest in all Syria,</LINE>
<LINE>I tell you what mine authors say:</LINE>
<LINE>This king unto him took a fere,</LINE>
<LINE>Who died and left a female heir,</LINE>
<LINE>So buxom, blithe, and full of face,</LINE>
<LINE>As heaven had lent her all his grace;</LINE>
<LINE>With whom the father liking took,</LINE>
<LINE>And her to incest did provoke:</LINE>
<LINE>Bad child; worse father! to entice his own</LINE>
<LINE>To evil should be done by none:</LINE>
<LINE>But custom what they did begin</LINE>
<LINE>Was with long use account no sin.</LINE>
<LINE>The beauty of this sinful dame</LINE>
<LINE>Made many princes thither frame,</LINE>
<LINE>To seek her as a bed-fellow,</LINE>
<LINE>In marriage-pleasures play-fellow:</LINE>
<LINE>Which to prevent he made a law,</LINE>
<LINE>To keep her still, and men in awe,</LINE>
<LINE>That whoso ask'd her for his wife,</LINE>
<LINE>His riddle told not, lost his life:</LINE>
<LINE>So for her many a wight did die,</LINE>
<LINE>As yon grim looks do testify.</LINE>
<LINE>What now ensues, to the judgment of your eye</LINE>
<LINE>I give, my cause who best can justify.</LINE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE I.  Antioch. A room in the palace.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter ANTIOCHUS, Prince PERICLES, and followers</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIOCHUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Young prince of Tyre, you have at large received</LINE>
<LINE>The danger of the task you undertake.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have, Antiochus, and, with a soul</LINE>
<LINE>Embolden'd with the glory of her praise,</LINE>
<LINE>Think death no hazard in this enterprise.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIOCHUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Bring in our daughter, clothed like a bride,</LINE>
<LINE>For the embracements even of Jove himself;</LINE>
<LINE>At whose conception, till Lucina reign'd,</LINE>
<LINE>Nature this dowry gave, to glad her presence,</LINE>
<LINE>The senate-house of planets all did sit,</LINE>
<LINE>To knit in her their best perfections.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Music. Enter the Daughter of ANTIOCHUS</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>See where she comes, apparell'd like the spring,</LINE>
<LINE>Graces her subjects, and her thoughts the king</LINE>
<LINE>Of every virtue gives renown to men!</LINE>
<LINE>Her face the book of praises, where is read</LINE>
<LINE>Nothing but curious pleasures, as from thence</LINE>
<LINE>Sorrow were ever razed and testy wrath</LINE>
<LINE>Could never be her mild companion.</LINE>
<LINE>You gods that made me man, and sway in love,</LINE>
<LINE>That have inflamed desire in my breast</LINE>
<LINE>To taste the fruit of yon celestial tree,</LINE>
<LINE>Or die in the adventure, be my helps,</LINE>
<LINE>As I am son and servant to your will,</LINE>
<LINE>To compass such a boundless happiness!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIOCHUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Prince Pericles,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That would be son to great Antiochus.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIOCHUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Before thee stands this fair Hesperides,</LINE>
<LINE>With golden fruit, but dangerous to be touch'd;</LINE>
<LINE>For death-like dragons here affright thee hard:</LINE>
<LINE>Her face, like heaven, enticeth thee to view</LINE>
<LINE>Her countless glory, which desert must gain;</LINE>
<LINE>And which, without desert, because thine eye</LINE>
<LINE>Presumes to reach, all thy whole heap must die.</LINE>
<LINE>Yon sometimes famous princes, like thyself,</LINE>
<LINE>Drawn by report, adventurous by desire,</LINE>
<LINE>Tell thee, with speechless tongues and semblance pale,</LINE>
<LINE>That without covering, save yon field of stars,</LINE>
<LINE>Here they stand martyrs, slain in Cupid's wars;</LINE>
<LINE>And with dead cheeks advise thee to desist</LINE>
<LINE>For going on death's net, whom none resist.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Antiochus, I thank thee, who hath taught</LINE>
<LINE>My frail mortality to know itself,</LINE>
<LINE>And by those fearful objects to prepare</LINE>
<LINE>This body, like to them, to what I must;</LINE>
<LINE>For death remember'd should be like a mirror,</LINE>
<LINE>Who tells us life's but breath, to trust it error.</LINE>
<LINE>I'll make my will then, and, as sick men do</LINE>
<LINE>Who know the world, see heaven, but, feeling woe,</LINE>
<LINE>Gripe not at earthly joys as erst they did;</LINE>
<LINE>So I bequeath a happy peace to you</LINE>
<LINE>And all good men, as every prince should do;</LINE>
<LINE>My riches to the earth from whence they came;</LINE>
<LINE>But my unspotted fire of love to you.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>To the Daughter of ANTIOCHUS</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Thus ready for the way of life or death,</LINE>
<LINE>I wait the sharpest blow, Antiochus.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIOCHUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Scorning advice, read the conclusion then:</LINE>
<LINE>Which read and not expounded, 'tis decreed,</LINE>
<LINE>As these before thee thou thyself shalt bleed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Daughter</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Of all say'd yet, mayst thou prove prosperous!</LINE>
<LINE>Of all say'd yet, I wish thee happiness!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Like a bold champion, I assume the lists,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor ask advice of any other thought</LINE>
<LINE>But faithfulness and courage.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>He reads the riddle</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>I am no viper, yet I feed</LINE>
<LINE>On mother's flesh which did me breed.</LINE>
<LINE>I sought a husband, in which labour</LINE>
<LINE>I found that kindness in a father:</LINE>
<LINE>He's father, son, and husband mild;</LINE>
<LINE>I mother, wife, and yet his child.</LINE>
<LINE>How they may be, and yet in two,</LINE>
<LINE>As you will live, resolve it you.</LINE>
<LINE>Sharp physic is the last: but, O you powers</LINE>
<LINE>That give heaven countless eyes to view men's acts,</LINE>
<LINE>Why cloud they not their sights perpetually,</LINE>
<LINE>If this be true, which makes me pale to read it?</LINE>
<LINE>Fair glass of light, I loved you, and could still,</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Takes hold of the hand of the Daughter of ANTIOCHUS</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Were not this glorious casket stored with ill:</LINE>
<LINE>But I must tell you, now my thoughts revolt</LINE>
<LINE>For he's no man on whom perfections wait</LINE>
<LINE>That, knowing sin within, will touch the gate.</LINE>
<LINE>You are a fair viol, and your sense the strings;</LINE>
<LINE>Who, finger'd to make man his lawful music,</LINE>
<LINE>Would draw heaven down, and all the gods, to hearken:</LINE>
<LINE>But being play'd upon before your time,</LINE>
<LINE>Hell only danceth at so harsh a chime.</LINE>
<LINE>Good sooth, I care not for you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIOCHUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Prince Pericles, touch not, upon thy life.</LINE>
<LINE>For that's an article within our law,</LINE>
<LINE>As dangerous as the rest. Your time's expired:</LINE>
<LINE>Either expound now, or receive your sentence.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Great king,</LINE>
<LINE>Few love to hear the sins they love to act;</LINE>
<LINE>'Twould braid yourself too near for me to tell it.</LINE>
<LINE>Who has a book of all that monarchs do,</LINE>
<LINE>He's more secure to keep it shut than shown:</LINE>
<LINE>For vice repeated is like the wandering wind.</LINE>
<LINE>Blows dust in other's eyes, to spread itself;</LINE>
<LINE>And yet the end of all is bought thus dear,</LINE>
<LINE>The breath is gone, and the sore eyes see clear:</LINE>
<LINE>To stop the air would hurt them. The blind mole casts</LINE>
<LINE>Copp'd hills towards heaven, to tell the earth is throng'd</LINE>
<LINE>By man's oppression; and the poor worm doth die for't.</LINE>
<LINE>Kings are earth's gods; in vice their law's</LINE>
<LINE>their will;</LINE>
<LINE>And if Jove stray, who dares say Jove doth ill?</LINE>
<LINE>It is enough you know; and it is fit,</LINE>
<LINE>What being more known grows worse, to smother it.</LINE>
<LINE>All love the womb that their first being bred,</LINE>
<LINE>Then give my tongue like leave to love my head.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIOCHUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  Heaven, that I had thy head! he has found</LINE>
<LINE>the meaning:</LINE>
<LINE>But I will gloze with him.--Young prince of Tyre,</LINE>
<LINE>Though by the tenor of our strict edict,</LINE>
<LINE>Your exposition misinterpreting,</LINE>
<LINE>We might proceed to cancel of your days;</LINE>
<LINE>Yet hope, succeeding from so fair a tree</LINE>
<LINE>As your fair self, doth tune us otherwise:</LINE>
<LINE>Forty days longer we do respite you;</LINE>
<LINE>If by which time our secret be undone,</LINE>
<LINE>This mercy shows we'll joy in such a son:</LINE>
<LINE>And until then your entertain shall be</LINE>
<LINE>As doth befit our honour and your worth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt all but PERICLES</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How courtesy would seem to cover sin,</LINE>
<LINE>When what is done is like an hypocrite,</LINE>
<LINE>The which is good in nothing but in sight!</LINE>
<LINE>If it be true that I interpret false,</LINE>
<LINE>Then were it certain you were not so bad</LINE>
<LINE>As with foul incest to abuse your soul;</LINE>
<LINE>Where now you're both a father and a son,</LINE>
<LINE>By your untimely claspings with your child,</LINE>
<LINE>Which pleasure fits an husband, not a father;</LINE>
<LINE>And she an eater of her mother's flesh,</LINE>
<LINE>By the defiling of her parent's bed;</LINE>
<LINE>And both like serpents are, who though they feed</LINE>
<LINE>On sweetest flowers, yet they poison breed.</LINE>
<LINE>Antioch, farewell! for wisdom sees, those men</LINE>
<LINE>Blush not in actions blacker than the night,</LINE>
<LINE>Will shun no course to keep them from the light.</LINE>
<LINE>One sin, I know, another doth provoke;</LINE>
<LINE>Murder's as near to lust as flame to smoke:</LINE>
<LINE>Poison and treason are the hands of sin,</LINE>
<LINE>Ay, and the targets, to put off the shame:</LINE>
<LINE>Then, lest my lie be cropp'd to keep you clear,</LINE>
<LINE>By flight I'll shun the danger which I fear.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>Re-enter ANTIOCHUS</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIOCHUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He hath found the meaning, for which we mean</LINE>
<LINE>To have his head.</LINE>
<LINE>He must not live to trumpet forth my infamy,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor tell the world Antiochus doth sin</LINE>
<LINE>In such a loathed manner;</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore instantly this prince must die:</LINE>
<LINE>For by his fall my honour must keep high.</LINE>
<LINE>Who attends us there?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter THALIARD</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THALIARD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Doth your highness call?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIOCHUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thaliard,</LINE>
<LINE>You are of our chamber, and our mind partakes</LINE>
<LINE>Her private actions to your secrecy;</LINE>
<LINE>And for your faithfulness we will advance you.</LINE>
<LINE>Thaliard, behold, here's poison, and here's gold;</LINE>
<LINE>We hate the prince of Tyre, and thou must kill him:</LINE>
<LINE>It fits thee not to ask the reason why,</LINE>
<LINE>Because we bid it. Say, is it done?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THALIARD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord,</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis done.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIOCHUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Enough.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter a Messenger</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Let your breath cool yourself, telling your haste.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, prince Pericles is fled.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIOCHUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As thou</LINE>
<LINE>Wilt live, fly after: and like an arrow shot</LINE>
<LINE>From a well-experienced archer hits the mark</LINE>
<LINE>His eye doth level at, so thou ne'er return</LINE>
<LINE>Unless thou say 'Prince Pericles is dead.'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THALIARD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord,</LINE>
<LINE>If I can get him within my pistol's length,</LINE>
<LINE>I'll make him sure enough: so, farewell to your highness.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIOCHUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thaliard, adieu!</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit THALIARD</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Till Pericles be dead,</LINE>
<LINE>My heart can lend no succor to my head.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>
</SCENE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE II.  Tyre. A room in the palace.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter PERICLES</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>To Lords without</STAGEDIR>  Let none disturb us.--Why should</LINE>
<LINE>this change of thoughts,</LINE>
<LINE>The sad companion, dull-eyed melancholy,</LINE>
<LINE>Be my so used a guest as not an hour,</LINE>
<LINE>In the day's glorious walk, or peaceful night,</LINE>
<LINE>The tomb where grief should sleep, can breed me quiet?</LINE>
<LINE>Here pleasures court mine eyes, and mine eyes shun them,</LINE>
<LINE>And danger, which I fear'd, is at Antioch,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose aim seems far too short to hit me here:</LINE>
<LINE>Yet neither pleasure's art can joy my spirits,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor yet the other's distance comfort me.</LINE>
<LINE>Then it is thus: the passions of the mind,</LINE>
<LINE>That have their first conception by mis-dread,</LINE>
<LINE>Have after-nourishment and life by care;</LINE>
<LINE>And what was first but fear what might be done,</LINE>
<LINE>Grows elder now and cares it be not done.</LINE>
<LINE>And so with me: the great Antiochus,</LINE>
<LINE>'Gainst whom I am too little to contend,</LINE>
<LINE>Since he's so great can make his will his act,</LINE>
<LINE>Will think me speaking, though I swear to silence;</LINE>
<LINE>Nor boots it me to say I honour him.</LINE>
<LINE>If he suspect I may dishonour him:</LINE>
<LINE>And what may make him blush in being known,</LINE>
<LINE>He'll stop the course by which it might be known;</LINE>
<LINE>With hostile forces he'll o'erspread the land,</LINE>
<LINE>And with the ostent of war will look so huge,</LINE>
<LINE>Amazement shall drive courage from the state;</LINE>
<LINE>Our men be vanquish'd ere they do resist,</LINE>
<LINE>And subjects punish'd that ne'er thought offence:</LINE>
<LINE>Which care of them, not pity of myself,</LINE>
<LINE>Who am no more but as the tops of trees,</LINE>
<LINE>Which fence the roots they grow by and defend them,</LINE>
<LINE>Makes both my body pine and soul to languish,</LINE>
<LINE>And punish that before that he would punish.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter HELICANUS, with other Lords</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Joy and all comfort in your sacred breast!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And keep your mind, till you return to us,</LINE>
<LINE>Peaceful and comfortable!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELICANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Peace, peace, and give experience tongue.</LINE>
<LINE>They do abuse the king that flatter him:</LINE>
<LINE>For flattery is the bellows blows up sin;</LINE>
<LINE>The thing which is flatter'd, but a spark,</LINE>
<LINE>To which that blast gives heat and stronger glowing;</LINE>
<LINE>Whereas reproof, obedient and in order,</LINE>
<LINE>Fits kings, as they are men, for they may err.</LINE>
<LINE>When Signior Sooth here does proclaim a peace,</LINE>
<LINE>He flatters you, makes war upon your life.</LINE>
<LINE>Prince, pardon me, or strike me, if you please;</LINE>
<LINE>I cannot be much lower than my knees.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>All leave us else; but let your cares o'erlook</LINE>
<LINE>What shipping and what lading's in our haven,</LINE>
<LINE>And then return to us.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exeunt Lords</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Helicanus, thou</LINE>
<LINE>Hast moved us: what seest thou in our looks?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELICANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>An angry brow, dread lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If there be such a dart in princes' frowns,</LINE>
<LINE>How durst thy tongue move anger to our face?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELICANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How dare the plants look up to heaven, from whence</LINE>
<LINE>They have their nourishment?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Thou know'st I have power</LINE>

<SPEAKER>HELICANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Kneeling</STAGEDIR></LINE>
<LINE>I have ground the axe myself;</LINE>
<LINE>Do you but strike the blow.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Rise, prithee, rise.</LINE>
<LINE>Sit down: thou art no flatterer:</LINE>
<LINE>I thank thee for it; and heaven forbid</LINE>
<LINE>That kings should let their ears hear their</LINE>
<LINE>faults hid!</LINE>
<LINE>Fit counsellor and servant for a prince,</LINE>
<LINE>Who by thy wisdom makest a prince thy servant,</LINE>
<LINE>What wouldst thou have me do?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELICANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To bear with patience</LINE>
<LINE>Such griefs as you yourself do lay upon yourself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou speak'st like a physician, Helicanus,</LINE>
<LINE>That minister'st a potion unto me</LINE>
<LINE>That thou wouldst tremble to receive thyself.</LINE>
<LINE>Attend me, then: I went to Antioch,</LINE>
<LINE>Where as thou know'st, against the face of death,</LINE>
<LINE>I sought the purchase of a glorious beauty.</LINE>
<LINE>From whence an issue I might propagate,</LINE>
<LINE>Are arms to princes, and bring joys to subjects.</LINE>
<LINE>Her face was to mine eye beyond all wonder;</LINE>
<LINE>The rest--hark in thine ear--as black as incest:</LINE>
<LINE>Which by my knowledge found, the sinful father</LINE>
<LINE>Seem'd not to strike, but smooth: but thou</LINE>
<LINE>know'st this,</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis time to fear when tyrants seem to kiss.</LINE>
<LINE>Such fear so grew in me, I hither fled,</LINE>
<LINE>Under the covering of a careful night,</LINE>
<LINE>Who seem'd my good protector; and, being here,</LINE>
<LINE>Bethought me what was past, what might succeed.</LINE>
<LINE>I knew him tyrannous; and tyrants' fears</LINE>
<LINE>Decrease not, but grow faster than the years:</LINE>
<LINE>And should he doubt it, as no doubt he doth,</LINE>
<LINE>That I should open to the listening air</LINE>
<LINE>How many worthy princes' bloods were shed,</LINE>
<LINE>To keep his bed of blackness unlaid ope,</LINE>
<LINE>To lop that doubt, he'll fill this land with arms,</LINE>
<LINE>And make pretence of wrong that I have done him:</LINE>
<LINE>When all, for mine, if I may call offence,</LINE>
<LINE>Must feel war's blow, who spares not innocence:</LINE>
<LINE>Which love to all, of which thyself art one,</LINE>
<LINE>Who now reprovest me for it,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELICANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alas, sir!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Drew sleep out of mine eyes, blood from my cheeks,</LINE>
<LINE>Musings into my mind, with thousand doubts</LINE>
<LINE>How I might stop this tempest ere it came;</LINE>
<LINE>And finding little comfort to relieve them,</LINE>
<LINE>I thought it princely charity to grieve them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELICANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, my lord, since you have given me leave to speak.</LINE>
<LINE>Freely will I speak. Antiochus you fear,</LINE>
<LINE>And justly too, I think, you fear the tyrant,</LINE>
<LINE>Who either by public war or private treason</LINE>
<LINE>Will take away your life.</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore, my lord, go travel for a while,</LINE>
<LINE>Till that his rage and anger be forgot,</LINE>
<LINE>Or till the Destinies do cut his thread of life.</LINE>
<LINE>Your rule direct to any; if to me.</LINE>
<LINE>Day serves not light more faithful than I'll be.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do not doubt thy faith;</LINE>
<LINE>But should he wrong my liberties in my absence?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELICANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We'll mingle our bloods together in the earth,</LINE>
<LINE>From whence we had our being and our birth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tyre, I now look from thee then, and to Tarsus</LINE>
<LINE>Intend my travel, where I'll hear from thee;</LINE>
<LINE>And by whose letters I'll dispose myself.</LINE>
<LINE>The care I had and have of subjects' good</LINE>
<LINE>On thee I lay whose wisdom's strength can bear it.</LINE>
<LINE>I'll take thy word for faith, not ask thine oath:</LINE>
<LINE>Who shuns not to break one will sure crack both:</LINE>
<LINE>But in our orbs we'll live so round and safe,</LINE>
<LINE>That time of both this truth shall ne'er convince,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou show'dst a subject's shine, I a true prince.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THALIARD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So, this is Tyre, and this the court. Here must I</LINE>
<LINE>kill King Pericles; and if I do it not, I am sure to</LINE>
<LINE>be hanged at home: 'tis dangerous. Well, I perceive</LINE>
<LINE>he was a wise fellow, and had good discretion, that,</LINE>
<LINE>being bid to ask what he would of the king, desired</LINE>
<LINE>he might know none of his secrets: now do I see he</LINE>
<LINE>had some reason for't; for if a king bid a man be a</LINE>
<LINE>villain, he's bound by the indenture of his oath to</LINE>
<LINE>be one! Hush! here come the lords of Tyre.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter HELICANUS and ESCANES, with other Lords of Tyre</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELICANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You shall not need, my fellow peers of Tyre,</LINE>
<LINE>Further to question me of your king's departure:</LINE>
<LINE>His seal'd commission, left in trust with me,</LINE>
<LINE>Doth speak sufficiently he's gone to travel.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THALIARD</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  How! the king gone!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELICANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If further yet you will be satisfied,</LINE>
<LINE>Why, as it were unlicensed of your loves,</LINE>
<LINE>He would depart, I'll give some light unto you.</LINE>
<LINE>Being at Antioch--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THALIARD</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>          What from Antioch?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELICANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Royal Antiochus--on what cause I know not--</LINE>
<LINE>Took some displeasure at him; at least he judged so:</LINE>
<LINE>And doubting lest that he had err'd or sinn'd,</LINE>
<LINE>To show his sorrow, he'ld correct himself;</LINE>
<LINE>So puts himself unto the shipman's toil,</LINE>
<LINE>With whom each minute threatens life or death.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THALIARD</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  Well, I perceive</LINE>
<LINE>I shall not be hang'd now, although I would;</LINE>
<LINE>But since he's gone, the king's seas must please:</LINE>
<LINE>He 'scaped the land, to perish at the sea.</LINE>
<LINE>I'll present myself. Peace to the lords of Tyre!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELICANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lord Thaliard from Antiochus is welcome.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THALIARD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>From him I come</LINE>
<LINE>With message unto princely Pericles;</LINE>
<LINE>But since my landing I have understood</LINE>
<LINE>Your lord has betook himself to unknown travels,</LINE>
<LINE>My message must return from whence it came.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELICANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We have no reason to desire it,</LINE>
<LINE>Commended to our master, not to us:</LINE>
<LINE>Yet, ere you shall depart, this we desire,</LINE>
<LINE>As friends to Antioch, we may feast in Tyre.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My Dionyza, shall we rest us here,</LINE>
<LINE>And by relating tales of others' griefs,</LINE>
<LINE>See if 'twill teach us to forget our own?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DIONYZA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That were to blow at fire in hope to quench it;</LINE>
<LINE>For who digs hills because they do aspire</LINE>
<LINE>Throws down one mountain to cast up a higher.</LINE>
<LINE>O my distressed lord, even such our griefs are;</LINE>
<LINE>Here they're but felt, and seen with mischief's eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>But like to groves, being topp'd, they higher rise.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O Dionyza,</LINE>
<LINE>Who wanteth food, and will not say he wants it,</LINE>
<LINE>Or can conceal his hunger till he famish?</LINE>
<LINE>Our tongues and sorrows do sound deep</LINE>
<LINE>Our woes into the air; our eyes do weep,</LINE>
<LINE>Till tongues fetch breath that may proclaim them louder;</LINE>
<LINE>That, if heaven slumber while their creatures want,</LINE>
<LINE>They may awake their helps to comfort them.</LINE>
<LINE>I'll then discourse our woes, felt several years,</LINE>
<LINE>And wanting breath to speak help me with tears.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DIONYZA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll do my best, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This Tarsus, o'er which I have the government,</LINE>
<LINE>A city on whom plenty held full hand,</LINE>
<LINE>For riches strew'd herself even in the streets;</LINE>
<LINE>Whose towers bore heads so high they kiss'd the clouds,</LINE>
<LINE>And strangers ne'er beheld but wondered at;</LINE>
<LINE>Whose men and dames so jetted and adorn'd,</LINE>
<LINE>Like one another's glass to trim them by:</LINE>
<LINE>Their tables were stored full, to glad the sight,</LINE>
<LINE>And not so much to feed on as delight;</LINE>
<LINE>All poverty was scorn'd, and pride so great,</LINE>
<LINE>The name of help grew odious to repeat.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DIONYZA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, 'tis too true.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But see what heaven can do! By this our change,</LINE>
<LINE>These mouths, who but of late, earth, sea, and air,</LINE>
<LINE>Were all too little to content and please,</LINE>
<LINE>Although they gave their creatures in abundance,</LINE>
<LINE>As houses are defiled for want of use,</LINE>
<LINE>They are now starved for want of exercise:</LINE>
<LINE>Those palates who, not yet two summers younger,</LINE>
<LINE>Must have inventions to delight the taste,</LINE>
<LINE>Would now be glad of bread, and beg for it:</LINE>
<LINE>Those mothers who, to nousle up their babes,</LINE>
<LINE>Thought nought too curious, are ready now</LINE>
<LINE>To eat those little darlings whom they loved.</LINE>
<LINE>So sharp are hunger's teeth, that man and wife</LINE>
<LINE>Draw lots who first shall die to lengthen life:</LINE>
<LINE>Here stands a lord, and there a lady weeping;</LINE>
<LINE>Here many sink, yet those which see them fall</LINE>
<LINE>Have scarce strength left to give them burial.</LINE>
<LINE>Is not this true?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DIONYZA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Our cheeks and hollow eyes do witness it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, let those cities that of plenty's cup</LINE>
<LINE>And her prosperities so largely taste,</LINE>
<LINE>With their superfluous riots, hear these tears!</LINE>
<LINE>The misery of Tarsus may be theirs.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We have descried, upon our neighbouring shore,</LINE>
<LINE>A portly sail of ships make hitherward.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I thought as much.</LINE>
<LINE>One sorrow never comes but brings an heir,</LINE>
<LINE>That may succeed as his inheritor;</LINE>
<LINE>And so in ours: some neighbouring nation,</LINE>
<LINE>Taking advantage of our misery,</LINE>
<LINE>Hath stuff'd these hollow vessels with their power,</LINE>
<LINE>To beat us down, the which are down already;</LINE>
<LINE>And make a conquest of unhappy me,</LINE>
<LINE>Whereas no glory's got to overcome.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That's the least fear; for, by the semblance</LINE>
<LINE>Of their white flags display'd, they bring us peace,</LINE>
<LINE>And come to us as favourers, not as foes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou speak'st like him's untutor'd to repeat:</LINE>
<LINE>Who makes the fairest show means most deceit.</LINE>
<LINE>But bring they what they will and what they can,</LINE>
<LINE>What need we fear?</LINE>
<LINE>The ground's the lowest, and we are half way there.</LINE>
<LINE>Go tell their general we attend him here,</LINE>
<LINE>To know for what he comes, and whence he comes,</LINE>

<LINE>We have heard your miseries as far as Tyre,</LINE>
<LINE>And seen the desolation of your streets:</LINE>
<LINE>Nor come we to add sorrow to your tears,</LINE>

<LINE>Good Helicane, that stay'd at home,</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Fisherman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ha, come and bring away the nets!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Fisherman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, Patch-breech, I say!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Third Fisherman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What say you, master?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Fisherman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Look how thou stirrest now! come away, or I'll</LINE>
<LINE>fetch thee with a wanion.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Third Fisherman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Faith, master, I am thinking of the poor men that</LINE>
<LINE>were cast away before us even now.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Fisherman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alas, poor souls, it grieved my heart to hear what</LINE>
<LINE>pitiful cries they made to us to help them, when,</LINE>
<LINE>well-a-day, we could scarce help ourselves.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Third Fisherman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, master, said not I as much when I saw the</LINE>
<LINE>porpus how he bounced and tumbled? they say</LINE>
<LINE>they're half fish, half flesh: a plague on them,</LINE>
<LINE>they ne'er come but I look to be washed. Master, I</LINE>
<LINE>marvel how the fishes live in the sea.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Fisherman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, as men do a-land; the great ones eat up the</LINE>
<LINE>little ones: I can compare our rich misers to</LINE>
<LINE>nothing so fitly as to a whale; a' plays and</LINE>
<LINE>tumbles, driving the poor fry before him, and at</LINE>
<LINE>last devours them all at a mouthful: such whales</LINE>
<LINE>have I heard on o' the land, who never leave gaping</LINE>
<LINE>till they've swallowed the whole parish, church,</LINE>
<LINE>steeple, bells, and all.</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Fisherman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, man?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Third Fisherman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Because he should have swallowed me too: and when I</LINE>
<LINE>had been in his belly, I would have kept such a</LINE>
<LINE>jangling of the bells, that he should never have</LINE>
<LINE>left, till he cast bells, steeple, church, and</LINE>
<LINE>parish up again. But if the good King Simonides</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Fisherman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Honest! good fellow, what's that? If it be a day</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>No, friend, cannot you beg? Here's them in our</LINE>

<LINE>Which if you shall refuse, when I am dead,</LINE>

<LINE>But crave! Then I'll turn craver too, and so I</LINE>

<LINE>Why, are all your beggars whipped, then?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>An armour, friends! I pray you, let me see it.</LINE>
<LINE>Thanks, fortune, yet, that, after all my crosses,</LINE>

<LINE>Which my dead father did bequeath to me.</LINE>
<LINE>With this strict charge, even as he left his life,</LINE>
<LINE>'Keep it, my Pericles; it hath been a shield</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To beg of you, kind friends, this coat of worth,</LINE>

<LINE>And that you'ld guide me to your sovereign's court,</LINE>
<LINE>Where with it I may appear a gentleman;</LINE>
<LINE>And if that ever my low fortune's better,</LINE>
<LINE>I'll pay your bounties; till then rest your debtor.</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Fisherman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, but hark you, my friend; 'twas we that made up</LINE>
<LINE>this garment through the rough seams of the waters:</LINE>
<LINE>there are certain condolements, certain vails. I</LINE>
<LINE>hope, sir, if you thrive, you'll remember from</LINE>
<LINE>whence you had it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Believe 't, I will.</LINE>
<LINE>By your furtherance I am clothed in steel;</LINE>
<LINE>And, spite of all the rapture of the sea,</LINE>
<LINE>This jewel holds his building on my arm:</LINE>
<LINE>Unto thy value I will mount myself</LINE>
<LINE>Upon a courser, whose delightful steps</LINE>
<LINE>Shall make the gazer joy to see him tread.</LINE>
<LINE>Only, my friend, I yet am unprovided</LINE>
<LINE>Of a pair of bases.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Fisherman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We'll sure provide: thou shalt have my best gown to</LINE>
<LINE>make thee a pair; and I'll bring thee to the court myself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then honour be but a goal to my will,</LINE>

<LINE>Are the knights ready to begin the triumph?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They are, my liege;</LINE>
<LINE>And stay your coming to present themselves.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIMONIDES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Return them, we are ready; and our daughter,</LINE>
<LINE>In honour of whose birth these triumphs are,</LINE>
<LINE>Sits here, like beauty's child, whom nature gat</LINE>
<LINE>For men to see, and seeing wonder at.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit a Lord</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THAISA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It pleaseth you, my royal father, to express</LINE>
<LINE>My commendations great, whose merit's less.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIMONIDES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It's fit it should be so; for princes are</LINE>
<LINE>A model which heaven makes like to itself:</LINE>
<LINE>As jewels lose their glory if neglected,</LINE>
<LINE>So princes their renowns if not respected.</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis now your honour, daughter, to explain</LINE>
<LINE>The labour of each knight in his device.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THAISA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Which, to preserve mine honour, I'll perform.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter a Knight; he passes over, and his Squire
presents his shield to the Princess</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIMONIDES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who is the first that doth prefer himself?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THAISA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A knight of Sparta, my renowned father;</LINE>
<LINE>And the device he bears upon his shield</LINE>
<LINE>Is a black Ethiope reaching at the sun</LINE>
<LINE>The word, 'Lux tua vita mihi.'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIMONIDES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He loves you well that holds his life of you.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>The Second Knight passes over</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Who is the second that presents himself?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THAISA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A prince of Macedon, my royal father;</LINE>
<LINE>And the device he bears upon his shield</LINE>
<LINE>Is an arm'd knight that's conquer'd by a lady;</LINE>
<LINE>The motto thus, in Spanish, 'Piu por dulzura que por fuerza.'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>The Third Knight passes over</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIMONIDES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And what's the third?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THAISA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The third of Antioch;</LINE>
<LINE>And his device, a wreath of chivalry;</LINE>
<LINE>The word, 'Me pompae provexit apex.'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>The Fourth Knight passes over</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIMONIDES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What is the fourth?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THAISA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A burning torch that's turned upside down;</LINE>
<LINE>The word, 'Quod me alit, me extinguit.'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIMONIDES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Which shows that beauty hath his power and will,</LINE>
<LINE>Which can as well inflame as it can kill.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>The Fifth Knight passes over</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THAISA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The fifth, an hand environed with clouds,</LINE>
<LINE>Holding out gold that's by the touchstone tried;</LINE>
<LINE>The motto thus, 'Sic spectanda fides.'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>The Sixth Knight, PERICLES, passes over</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIMONIDES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And what's</LINE>
<LINE>The sixth and last, the which the knight himself</LINE>
<LINE>With such a graceful courtesy deliver'd?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THAISA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He seems to be a stranger; but his present is</LINE>
<LINE>A wither'd branch, that's only green at top;</LINE>
<LINE>The motto, 'In hac spe vivo.'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIMONIDES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A pretty moral;</LINE>
<LINE>From the dejected state wherein he is,</LINE>
<LINE>He hopes by you his fortunes yet may flourish.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He had need mean better than his outward show</LINE>
<LINE>Can any way speak in his just commend;</LINE>
<LINE>For by his rusty outside he appears</LINE>
<LINE>To have practised more the whipstock than the lance.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He well may be a stranger, for he comes</LINE>
<LINE>To an honour'd triumph strangely furnished.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Third Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And on set purpose let his armour rust</LINE>
<LINE>Until this day, to scour it in the dust.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIMONIDES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Opinion's but a fool, that makes us scan</LINE>
<LINE>The outward habit by the inward man.</LINE>
<LINE>But stay, the knights are coming: we will withdraw</LINE>
<LINE>Into the gallery.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>Great shouts within and all cry 'The mean knight!'</STAGEDIR>
</SCENE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE III.  The same. A hall of state: a banquet prepared.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter SIMONIDES, THAISA, Lords, Attendants, and
Knights, from tilting</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIMONIDES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Knights,</LINE>
<LINE>To say you're welcome were superfluous.</LINE>
<LINE>To place upon the volume of your deeds,</LINE>
<LINE>As in a title-page, your worth in arms,</LINE>
<LINE>Were more than you expect, or more than's fit,</LINE>
<LINE>Since every worth in show commends itself.</LINE>
<LINE>Prepare for mirth, for mirth becomes a feast:</LINE>
<LINE>You are princes and my guests.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THAISA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But you, my knight and guest;</LINE>
<LINE>To whom this wreath of victory I give,</LINE>
<LINE>And crown you king of this day's happiness.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis more by fortune, lady, than by merit.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIMONIDES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Call it by what you will, the day is yours;</LINE>
<LINE>And here, I hope, is none that envies it.</LINE>
<LINE>In framing an artist, art hath thus decreed,</LINE>
<LINE>To make some good, but others to exceed;</LINE>
<LINE>And you are her labour'd scholar. Come, queen o'</LINE>
<LINE>the feast,--</LINE>
<LINE>For, daughter, so you are,--here take your place:</LINE>
<LINE>Marshal the rest, as they deserve their grace.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEAKER>KNIGHTS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We are honour'd much by good Simonides.</LINE>

<LINE>Sir, yonder is your place.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Some other is more fit.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Knight</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Contend not, sir; for we are gentlemen</LINE>
<LINE>That neither in our hearts nor outward eyes</LINE>
<LINE>Envy the great nor do the low despise.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You are right courteous knights.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIMONIDES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sit, sir, sit.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By Jove, I wonder, that is king of thoughts,</LINE>
<LINE>These cates resist me, she but thought upon.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THAISA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By Juno, that is queen of marriage,</LINE>
<LINE>All viands that I eat do seem unsavoury.</LINE>
<LINE>Wishing him my meat. Sure, he's a gallant gentleman.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIMONIDES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He's but a country gentleman;</LINE>
<LINE>Has done no more than other knights have done;</LINE>
<LINE>Has broken a staff or so; so let it pass.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THAISA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To me he seems like diamond to glass.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yon king's to me like to my father's picture,</LINE>
<LINE>Which tells me in that glory once he was;</LINE>
<LINE>Had princes sit, like stars, about his throne,</LINE>
<LINE>And he the sun, for them to reverence;</LINE>
<LINE>None that beheld him, but, like lesser lights,</LINE>
<LINE>Did vail their crowns to his supremacy:</LINE>
<LINE>Where now his son's like a glow-worm in the night,</LINE>
<LINE>The which hath fire in darkness, none in light:</LINE>
<LINE>Whereby I see that Time's the king of men,</LINE>
<LINE>He's both their parent, and he is their grave,</LINE>
<LINE>And gives them what he will, not what they crave.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIMONIDES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, are you merry, knights?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Knights</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who can be other in this royal presence?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIMONIDES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here, with a cup that's stored unto the brim,--</LINE>
<LINE>As you do love, fill to your mistress' lips,--</LINE>
<LINE>We drink this health to you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KNIGHTS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We thank your grace.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIMONIDES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yet pause awhile:</LINE>
<LINE>Yon knight doth sit too melancholy,</LINE>
<LINE>As if the entertainment in our court</LINE>
<LINE>Had not a show might countervail his worth.</LINE>
<LINE>Note it not you, Thaisa?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THAISA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What is it</LINE>
<LINE>To me, my father?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIMONIDES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, attend, my daughter:</LINE>
<LINE>Princes in this should live like gods above,</LINE>
<LINE>Who freely give to every one that comes</LINE>
<LINE>To honour them:</LINE>
<LINE>And princes not doing so are like to gnats,</LINE>
<LINE>Which make a sound, but kill'd are wonder'd at.</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore to make his entrance more sweet,</LINE>
<LINE>Here, say we drink this standing-bowl of wine to him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THAISA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alas, my father, it befits not me</LINE>
<LINE>Unto a stranger knight to be so bold:</LINE>
<LINE>He may my proffer take for an offence,</LINE>
<LINE>Since men take women's gifts for impudence.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIMONIDES</SPEAKER>

<LINE>Do as I bid you, or you'll move me else.</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A gentleman of Tyre; my name, Pericles;</LINE>
<LINE>My education been in arts and arms;</LINE>
<LINE>Who, looking for adventures in the world,</LINE>
<LINE>Was by the rough seas reft of ships and men,</LINE>
<LINE>And after shipwreck driven upon this shore.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THAISA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He thanks your grace; names himself Pericles,</LINE>
<LINE>A gentleman of Tyre,</LINE>
<LINE>Who only by misfortune of the seas</LINE>
<LINE>Bereft of ships and men, cast on this shore.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIMONIDES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, by the gods, I pity his misfortune,</LINE>
<LINE>And will awake him from his melancholy.</LINE>
<LINE>Come, gentlemen, we sit too long on trifles,</LINE>
<LINE>And waste the time, which looks for other revels.</LINE>
<LINE>Even in your armours, as you are address'd,</LINE>
<LINE>Will very well become a soldier's dance.</LINE>
<LINE>I will not have excuse, with saying this</LINE>
<LINE>Loud music is too harsh for ladies' heads,</LINE>
<LINE>Since they love men in arms as well as beds.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>The Knights dance</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>So, this was well ask'd,'twas so well perform'd.</LINE>
<LINE>Come, sir;</LINE>
<LINE>Here is a lady that wants breathing too:</LINE>
<LINE>And I have heard, you knights of Tyre</LINE>
<LINE>Are excellent in making ladies trip;</LINE>
<LINE>And that their measures are as excellent.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>PERICLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In those that practise them they are, my lord.</LINE>

<LINE>Thanks, gentlemen, to all; all have done well.</LINE>

<LINE>Due to this heinous capital offence,</LINE>
<LINE>Even in the height and pride of all his glory,</LINE>
<LINE>When he was seated in a chariot</LINE>
<LINE>Of an inestimable value, and his daughter with him,</LINE>
<LINE>A fire from heaven came and shrivell'd up</LINE>
<LINE>Their bodies, even to loathing; for they so stunk,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ESCANES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Twas very strange.</LINE>

<LINE>Sir, my daughter thinks very well of you;</LINE>

<LINE>'Tis the king's subtlety to have my life.</LINE>
<LINE>O, seek not to entrap me, gracious lord,</LINE>
<LINE>A stranger and distressed gentleman,</LINE>
<LINE>That never aim'd so high to love your daughter,</LINE>
<LINE>But bent all offices to honour her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>Thou hast bewitch'd my daughter, and thou art</LINE>

<LINE>By the gods, I have not:</LINE>

<LINE>My actions are as noble as my thoughts,</LINE>

<LINE>I came unto your court for honour's cause,</LINE>

<LINE>who, for aught I know,</LINE>
<LINE>May be, nor can I think the contrary,</LINE>
<LINE>As great in blood as I myself.--</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore hear you, mistress; either frame</LINE>
<LINE>Your will to mine,--and you, sir, hear you,</LINE>
<LINE>Either be ruled by me, or I will make you--</LINE>
<LINE>Man and wife:</LINE>
<LINE>Nay, come, your hands and lips must seal it too:</LINE>
<LINE>And being join'd, I'll thus your hopes destroy;</LINE>

<LINE>The cat, with eyne of burning coal,</LINE>

<LINE>E'er the blither for their drouth.</LINE>
<LINE>Hymen hath brought the bride to bed.</LINE>

<LINE>A babe is moulded. Be attent,</LINE>

<LINE>What's dumb in show I'll plain with speech.</LINE>
<SUBHEAD>DUMB SHOW.</SUBHEAD>
<STAGEDIR>Enter, PERICLES and SIMONIDES at one door, with
Attendants; a Messenger meets them, kneels, and
gives PERICLES a letter: PERICLES shows it
SIMONIDES; the Lords kneel to him. Then enter
THAISA with child, with LYCHORIDA a nurse. The
KING shows her the letter; she rejoices: she and
PERICLES takes leave of her father, and depart with
LYCHORIDA and their Attendants. Then exeunt
SIMONIDES and the rest</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>By many a dern and painful perch</LINE>
<LINE>Of Pericles the careful search,</LINE>
<LINE>By the four opposing coigns</LINE>
<LINE>Which the world together joins,</LINE>
<LINE>Is made with all due diligence</LINE>
<LINE>That horse and sail and high expense</LINE>
<LINE>Can stead the quest. At last from Tyre,</LINE>
<LINE>Fame answering the most strange inquire,</LINE>
<LINE>To the court of King Simonides</LINE>
<LINE>Are letters brought, the tenor these:</LINE>
<LINE>Antiochus and his daughter dead;</LINE>
<LINE>The men of Tyrus on the head</LINE>
<LINE>Of Helicanus would set on</LINE>
<LINE>The crown of Tyre, but he will none:</LINE>
<LINE>The mutiny he there hastes t' oppress;</LINE>
<LINE>Says to 'em, if King Pericles</LINE>
<LINE>Come not home in twice six moons,</LINE>
<LINE>He, obedient to their dooms,</LINE>
<LINE>Will take the crown. The sum of this,</LINE>
<LINE>Brought hither to Pentapolis,</LINE>
<LINE>Y-ravished the regions round,</LINE>
<LINE>And every one with claps can sound,</LINE>
<LINE>'Our heir-apparent is a king!</LINE>
<LINE>Who dream'd, who thought of such a thing?'</LINE>
<LINE>Brief, he must hence depart to Tyre:</LINE>
<LINE>His queen with child makes her desire--</LINE>
<LINE>Which who shall cross?--along to go:</LINE>
<LINE>Omit we all their dole and woe:</LINE>
<LINE>Lychorida, her nurse, she takes,</LINE>
<LINE>And so to sea. Their vessel shakes</LINE>
<LINE>On Neptune's billow; half the flood</LINE>

<LINE>Varies again; the grisly north</LINE>
<LINE>Disgorges such a tempest forth,</LINE>
<LINE>That, as a duck for life that dives,</LINE>
<LINE>So up and down the poor ship drives:</LINE>
<LINE>The lady shrieks, and well-a-near</LINE>
<LINE>Does fall in travail with her fear:</LINE>

<LINE>Thy nimble, sulphurous flashes! O, how, Lychorida,</LINE>

<LINE>Wilt thou spit all thyself? The seaman's whistle</LINE>
<LINE>Is as a whisper in the ears of death,</LINE>
<LINE>Unheard. Lychorida!--Lucina, O</LINE>
<LINE>Divinest patroness, and midwife gentle</LINE>
<LINE>To those that cry by night, convey thy deity</LINE>

<SPEAKER>LYCHORIDA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here is a thing too young for such a place,</LINE>

<LINE>Patience, good sir; do not assist the storm.</LINE>
<LINE>Here's all that is left living of your queen,</LINE>
<LINE>A little daughter: for the sake of it,</LINE>
<LINE>Be manly, and take comfort.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O you gods!</LINE>
<LINE>Why do you make us love your goodly gifts,</LINE>

<LINE>Recall not what we give, and therein may</LINE>
<LINE>Use honour with you.</LINE>

<LINE>For a more blustrous birth had never babe:</LINE>

<LINE>Thou hast as chiding a nativity</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Courage enough: I do not fear the flaw;</LINE>
<LINE>It hath done to me the worst. Yet, for the love</LINE>

<LINE>Sir, your queen must overboard: the sea works high,</LINE>

<LINE>No light, no fire: the unfriendly elements</LINE>
<LINE>Forgot thee utterly: nor have I time</LINE>
<LINE>To give thee hallow'd to thy grave, but straight</LINE>
<LINE>Must cast thee, scarcely coffin'd, in the ooze;</LINE>
<LINE>Where, for a monument upon thy bones,</LINE>
<LINE>And e'er-remaining lamps, the belching whale</LINE>
<LINE>And humming water must o'erwhelm thy corpse,</LINE>
<LINE>Lying with simple shells. O Lychorida,</LINE>
<LINE>Bid Nestor bring me spices, ink and paper,</LINE>
<LINE>My casket and my jewels; and bid Nicander</LINE>
<LINE>Bring me the satin coffer: lay the babe</LINE>

<LINE>Good morrow to your lordship.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CERIMON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Gentlemen,</LINE>
<LINE>Why do you stir so early?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Gentleman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir,</LINE>
<LINE>Our lodgings, standing bleak upon the sea,</LINE>
<LINE>Shook as the earth did quake;</LINE>
<LINE>The very principals did seem to rend,</LINE>
<LINE>And all-to topple: pure surprise and fear</LINE>
<LINE>Made me to quit the house.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Gentleman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That is the cause we trouble you so early;</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis not our husbandry.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CERIMON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, you say well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Gentleman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But I much marvel that your lordship, having</LINE>
<LINE>Rich tire about you, should at these early hours</LINE>
<LINE>Shake off the golden slumber of repose.</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis most strange,</LINE>
<LINE>Nature should be so conversant with pain,</LINE>
<LINE>Being thereto not compell'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CERIMON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I hold it ever,</LINE>
<LINE>Virtue and cunning were endowments greater</LINE>
<LINE>Than nobleness and riches: careless heirs</LINE>
<LINE>May the two latter darken and expend;</LINE>
<LINE>But immortality attends the former.</LINE>
<LINE>Making a man a god. 'Tis known, I ever</LINE>
<LINE>Have studied physic, through which secret art,</LINE>
<LINE>By turning o'er authorities, I have,</LINE>
<LINE>Together with my practise, made familiar</LINE>
<LINE>To me and to my aid the blest infusions</LINE>
<LINE>That dwell in vegetives, in metals, stones;</LINE>
<LINE>And I can speak of the disturbances</LINE>
<LINE>That nature works, and of her cures; which doth give me</LINE>
<LINE>A more content in course of true delight</LINE>
<LINE>Than to be thirsty after tottering honour,</LINE>
<LINE>Or tie my treasure up in silken bags,</LINE>
<LINE>To please the fool and death.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Gentleman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your honour has through Ephesus pour'd forth</LINE>
<LINE>Your charity, and hundreds call themselves</LINE>
<LINE>Your creatures, who by you have been restored:</LINE>

<LINE>Your purse, still open, hath built Lord Cerimon</LINE>
<LINE>Such strong renown as time shall ne'er decay.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>CERIMON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Set 't down, let's look upon't.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>'Tis like a coffin, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CERIMON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Whate'er it be,</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis wondrous heavy. Wrench it open straight:</LINE>
<LINE>If the sea's stomach be o'ercharged with gold,</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis a good constraint of fortune it belches upon us.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Gentleman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis so, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>I never saw so huge a billow, sir,</LINE>
<LINE>As toss'd it upon shore.</LINE>

<LINE>Wrench it open;</LINE>
<LINE>Soft! it smells most sweetly in my sense.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Gentleman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Most likely, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CERIMON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, certainly to-night;</LINE>
<LINE>For look how fresh she looks! They were too rough</LINE>
<LINE>That threw her in the sea. Make a fire within:</LINE>
<LINE>Fetch hither all my boxes in my closet.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit a Servant</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Death may usurp on nature many hours,</LINE>
<LINE>And yet the fire of life kindle again</LINE>
<LINE>The o'erpress'd spirits. I heard of an Egyptian</LINE>
<LINE>That had nine hours lien dead,</LINE>
<LINE>Who was by good appliance recovered.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Re-enter a Servant, with boxes, napkins, and fire</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Well said, well said; the fire and cloths.</LINE>
<LINE>The rough and woeful music that we have,</LINE>
<LINE>Cause it to sound, beseech you.</LINE>
<LINE>The viol once more: how thou stirr'st, thou block!</LINE>
<LINE>The music there!--I pray you, give her air.</LINE>
<LINE>Gentlemen.</LINE>

<LINE>We cannot but obey</LINE>

<LINE>For she was born at sea, I have named so, here</LINE>
<LINE>I charge your charity withal, leaving her</LINE>

<LINE>Fear not, my lord, but think</LINE>
<LINE>Your grace, that fed my country with your corn,</LINE>
<LINE>For which the people's prayers still fall upon you,</LINE>
<LINE>Must in your child be thought on. If neglection</LINE>
<LINE>Should therein make me vile, the common body,</LINE>
<LINE>By you relieved, would force me to my duty:</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GOWER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Imagine Pericles arrived at Tyre,</LINE>
<LINE>Welcomed and settled to his own desire.</LINE>
<LINE>His woeful queen we leave at Ephesus,</LINE>
<LINE>Unto Diana there a votaress.</LINE>
<LINE>Now to Marina bend your mind,</LINE>
<LINE>Whom our fast-growing scene must find</LINE>
<LINE>At Tarsus, and by Cleon train'd</LINE>
<LINE>In music, letters; who hath gain'd</LINE>
<LINE>Of education all the grace,</LINE>
<LINE>Which makes her both the heart and place</LINE>
<LINE>Of general wonder. But, alack,</LINE>
<LINE>That monster envy, oft the wrack</LINE>
<LINE>Of earned praise, Marina's life</LINE>
<LINE>Seeks to take off by treason's knife.</LINE>
<LINE>And in this kind hath our Cleon</LINE>
<LINE>One daughter, and a wench full grown,</LINE>
<LINE>Even ripe for marriage-rite; this maid</LINE>
<LINE>Hight Philoten: and it is said</LINE>
<LINE>For certain in our story, she</LINE>
<LINE>Would ever with Marina be:</LINE>
<LINE>Be't when she weaved the sleided silk</LINE>
<LINE>With fingers long, small, white as milk;</LINE>
<LINE>Or when she would with sharp needle wound</LINE>
<LINE>The cambric, which she made more sound</LINE>
<LINE>By hurting it; or when to the lute</LINE>
<LINE>She sung, and made the night-bird mute,</LINE>
<LINE>That still records with moan; or when</LINE>
<LINE>She would with rich and constant pen</LINE>
<LINE>Vail to her mistress Dian; still</LINE>
<LINE>This Philoten contends in skill</LINE>
<LINE>With absolute Marina: so</LINE>
<LINE>With the dove of Paphos might the crow</LINE>
<LINE>Vie feathers white. Marina gets</LINE>
<LINE>All praises, which are paid as debts,</LINE>
<LINE>And not as given. This so darks</LINE>
<LINE>In Philoten all graceful marks,</LINE>
<LINE>That Cleon's wife, with envy rare,</LINE>
<LINE>A present murderer does prepare</LINE>
<LINE>For good Marina, that her daughter</LINE>
<LINE>Might stand peerless by this slaughter.</LINE>
<LINE>The sooner her vile thoughts to stead,</LINE>
<LINE>Lychorida, our nurse, is dead:</LINE>
<LINE>And cursed Dionyza hath</LINE>
<LINE>The pregnant instrument of wrath</LINE>
<LINE>Prest for this blow. The unborn event</LINE>
<LINE>I do commend to your content:</LINE>

<LINE>Thy oath remember; thou hast sworn to do't:</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis but a blow, which never shall be known.</LINE>
<LINE>Thou canst not do a thing in the world so soon,</LINE>
<LINE>To yield thee so much profit. Let not conscience,</LINE>
<LINE>Which is but cold, inflaming love i' thy bosom,</LINE>
<LINE>Inflame too nicely; nor let pity, which</LINE>

<LINE>A soldier to thy purpose.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>I will do't; but yet she is a goodly creature.</LINE>

<LINE>No, I will rob Tellus of her weed,</LINE>
<LINE>To strew thy green with flowers: the yellows, blues,</LINE>
<LINE>The purple violets, and marigolds,</LINE>
<LINE>Shall as a carpet hang upon thy grave,</LINE>
<LINE>While summer-days do last. Ay me! poor maid,</LINE>
<LINE>Born in a tempest, when my mother died,</LINE>
<LINE>This world to me is like a lasting storm,</LINE>
<LINE>Whirring me from my friends.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>How now, Marina! why do you keep alone?</LINE>
<LINE>How chance my daughter is not with you? Do not</LINE>

<LINE>A nurse of me. Lord, how your favour's changed</LINE>
<LINE>With this unprofitable woe!</LINE>
<LINE>Come, give me your flowers, ere the sea mar it.</LINE>
<LINE>Walk with Leonine; the air is quick there,</LINE>
<LINE>And it pierces and sharpens the stomach. Come,</LINE>

<LINE>Come, come;</LINE>
<LINE>I love the king your father, and yourself,</LINE>
<LINE>With more than foreign heart. We every day</LINE>
<LINE>Expect him here: when he shall come and find</LINE>
<LINE>Our paragon to all reports thus blasted,</LINE>
<LINE>He will repent the breadth of his great voyage;</LINE>
<LINE>Blame both my lord and me, that we have taken</LINE>
<LINE>No care to your best courses. Go, I pray you,</LINE>
<LINE>Walk, and be cheerful once again; reserve</LINE>
<LINE>That excellent complexion, which did steal</LINE>
<LINE>The eyes of young and old. Care not for me</LINE>
<LINE>I can go home alone.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>Well, I will go;</LINE>

<LINE>Was't so?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My father, as nurse said, did never fear,</LINE>
<LINE>But cried 'Good seaman!' to the sailors, galling</LINE>
<LINE>His kingly hands, haling ropes;</LINE>
<LINE>And, clasping to the mast, endured a sea</LINE>
<LINE>That almost burst the deck.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>When was this?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>When I was born:</LINE>
<LINE>Never was waves nor wind more violent;</LINE>
<LINE>And from the ladder-tackle washes off</LINE>
<LINE>A canvas-climber. 'Ha!' says one, 'wilt out?'</LINE>
<LINE>And with a dropping industry they skip</LINE>
<LINE>From stem to stern: the boatswain whistles, and</LINE>

<LINE>Why would she have me kill'd?</LINE>
<LINE>Now, as I can remember, by my troth,</LINE>
<LINE>I never did her hurt in all my life:</LINE>
<LINE>I never spake bad word, nor did ill turn</LINE>
<LINE>To any living creature: believe me, la,</LINE>
<LINE>I never kill'd a mouse, nor hurt a fly:</LINE>
<LINE>I trod upon a worm against my will,</LINE>
<LINE>But I wept for it. How have I offended,</LINE>
<LINE>Wherein my death might yield her any profit,</LINE>
<LINE>Or my life imply her any danger?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEONINE</SPEAKER>

<LINE>You will not do't for all the world, I hope.</LINE>
<LINE>You are well favour'd, and your looks foreshow</LINE>
<LINE>You have a gentle heart. I saw you lately,</LINE>
<LINE>When you caught hurt in parting two that fought:</LINE>
<LINE>Good sooth, it show'd well in you: do so now:</LINE>

<LINE>she's dead,</LINE>
<LINE>And thrown into the sea. But I'll see further:</LINE>

<LINE>too wenchless.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Bawd</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We were never so much out of creatures. We have but</LINE>

<LINE>Therefore let's have fresh ones, whate'er we pay for</LINE>

<LINE>Thou sayest true; they're too unwholesome, o'</LINE>

<LINE>O, our credit comes not in like the commodity, nor</LINE>

<LINE>To-night, to-night. But, mistress, do you know the</LINE>
<LINE>French knight that cowers i' the hams?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Bawd</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who, Monsieur Veroles?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BOULT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, he: he offered to cut a caper at the</LINE>
<LINE>proclamation; but he made a groan at it, and swore</LINE>
<LINE>he would see her to-morrow.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Bawd</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, well; as for him, he brought his disease</LINE>
<LINE>hither: here he does but repair it. I know he will</LINE>
<LINE>come in our shadow, to scatter his crowns in the</LINE>
<LINE>sun.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BOULT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, if we had of every nation a traveller, we</LINE>
<LINE>should lodge them with this sign.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Bawd</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>To MARINA</STAGEDIR>  Pray you, come hither awhile. You</LINE>
<LINE>have fortunes coming upon you. Mark me: you must</LINE>
<LINE>seem to do that fearfully which you commit</LINE>
<LINE>willingly, despise profit where you have most gain.</LINE>
<LINE>To weep that you live as ye do makes pity in your</LINE>
<LINE>lovers: seldom but that pity begets you a good</LINE>
<LINE>opinion, and that opinion a mere profit.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I understand you not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BOULT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, take her home, mistress, take her home: these</LINE>
<LINE>blushes of hers must be quenched with some present practise.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Bawd</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou sayest true, i' faith, so they must; for your</LINE>
<LINE>bride goes to that with shame which is her way to go</LINE>
<LINE>with warrant.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BOULT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Faith, some do, and some do not. But, mistress, if</LINE>
<LINE>I have bargained for the joint,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Bawd</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou mayst cut a morsel off the spit.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BOULT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I may so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Bawd</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who should deny it? Come, young one, I like the</LINE>
<LINE>manner of your garments well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BOULT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, by my faith, they shall not be changed yet.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Bawd</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Boult, spend thou that in the town: report what a</LINE>
<LINE>sojourner we have; you'll lose nothing by custom.</LINE>
<LINE>When nature flamed this piece, she meant thee a good</LINE>
<LINE>turn; therefore say what a paragon she is, and thou</LINE>
<LINE>hast the harvest out of thine own report.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BOULT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I warrant you, mistress, thunder shall not so awake</LINE>
<LINE>the beds of eels as my giving out her beauty stir up</LINE>
<LINE>the lewdly-inclined. I'll bring home some to-night.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter CLEON and DIONYZA</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DIONYZA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, are you foolish? Can it be undone?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O Dionyza, such a piece of slaughter</LINE>
<LINE>The sun and moon ne'er look'd upon!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DIONYZA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I think</LINE>
<LINE>You'll turn a child again.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Were I chief lord of all this spacious world,</LINE>
<LINE>I'ld give it to undo the deed. O lady,</LINE>
<LINE>Much less in blood than virtue, yet a princess</LINE>
<LINE>To equal any single crown o' the earth</LINE>
<LINE>I' the justice of compare! O villain Leonine!</LINE>
<LINE>Whom thou hast poison'd too:</LINE>
<LINE>If thou hadst drunk to him, 't had been a kindness</LINE>
<LINE>Becoming well thy fact: what canst thou say</LINE>
<LINE>When noble Pericles shall demand his child?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DIONYZA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That she is dead. Nurses are not the fates,</LINE>
<LINE>To foster it, nor ever to preserve.</LINE>
<LINE>She died at night; I'll say so. Who can cross it?</LINE>
<LINE>Unless you play the pious innocent,</LINE>
<LINE>And for an honest attribute cry out</LINE>
<LINE>'She died by foul play.'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, go to. Well, well,</LINE>
<LINE>Of all the faults beneath the heavens, the gods</LINE>
<LINE>Do like this worst.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DIONYZA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Be one of those that think</LINE>
<LINE>The petty wrens of Tarsus will fly hence,</LINE>
<LINE>And open this to Pericles. I do shame</LINE>
<LINE>To think of what a noble strain you are,</LINE>
<LINE>And of how coward a spirit.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To such proceeding</LINE>
<LINE>Who ever but his approbation added,</LINE>
<LINE>Though not his prime consent, he did not flow</LINE>
<LINE>From honourable sources.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DIONYZA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Be it so, then:</LINE>
<LINE>Yet none does know, but you, how she came dead,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor none can know, Leonine being gone.</LINE>
<LINE>She did disdain my child, and stood between</LINE>
<LINE>Her and her fortunes: none would look on her,</LINE>
<LINE>But cast their gazes on Marina's face;</LINE>
<LINE>Whilst ours was blurted at and held a malkin</LINE>
<LINE>Not worth the time of day. It pierced me through;</LINE>
<LINE>And though you call my course unnatural,</LINE>
<LINE>You not your child well loving, yet I find</LINE>
<LINE>It greets me as an enterprise of kindness</LINE>
<LINE>Perform'd to your sole daughter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Heavens forgive it!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DIONYZA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And as for Pericles,</LINE>
<LINE>What should he say? We wept after her hearse,</LINE>
<LINE>And yet we mourn: her monument</LINE>
<LINE>Is almost finish'd, and her epitaphs</LINE>
<LINE>In glittering golden characters express</LINE>
<LINE>A general praise to her, and care in us</LINE>
<LINE>At whose expense 'tis done.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou art like the harpy,</LINE>
<LINE>Which, to betray, dost, with thine angel's face,</LINE>
<LINE>Seize with thine eagle's talons.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DIONYZA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You are like one that superstitiously</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GOWER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thus time we waste, and longest leagues make short;</LINE>
<LINE>Sail seas in cockles, have an wish but for't;</LINE>
<LINE>Making, to take your imagination,</LINE>
<LINE>From bourn to bourn, region to region.</LINE>
<LINE>By you being pardon'd, we commit no crime</LINE>
<LINE>To use one language in each several clime</LINE>
<LINE>Where our scenes seem to live. I do beseech you</LINE>
<LINE>To learn of me, who stand i' the gaps to teach you,</LINE>
<LINE>The stages of our story. Pericles</LINE>
<LINE>Is now again thwarting the wayward seas,</LINE>
<LINE>Attended on by many a lord and knight.</LINE>
<LINE>To see his daughter, all his life's delight.</LINE>
<LINE>Old Escanes, whom Helicanus late</LINE>
<LINE>Advanced in time to great and high estate,</LINE>
<LINE>Is left to govern. Bear you it in mind,</LINE>
<LINE>Old Helicanus goes along behind.</LINE>
<LINE>Well-sailing ships and bounteous winds have brought</LINE>
<LINE>This king to Tarsus,--think his pilot thought;</LINE>
<LINE>So with his steerage shall your thoughts grow on,--</LINE>
<LINE>To fetch his daughter home, who first is gone.</LINE>
<LINE>Like motes and shadows see them move awhile;</LINE>
<LINE>Your ears unto your eyes I'll reconcile.</LINE>
<SUBHEAD>DUMB SHOW.</SUBHEAD>
<STAGEDIR>Enter PERICLES, at one door, with all his train;
CLEON and DIONYZA, at the other. CLEON shows
PERICLES the tomb; whereat PERICLES makes
lamentation, puts on sackcloth, and in a mighty
passion departs. Then exeunt CLEON and DIONYZA</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>See how belief may suffer by foul show!</LINE>
<LINE>This borrow'd passion stands for true old woe;</LINE>
<LINE>And Pericles, in sorrow all devour'd,</LINE>
<LINE>With sighs shot through, and biggest tears</LINE>
<LINE>o'ershower'd,</LINE>
<LINE>Leaves Tarsus and again embarks. He swears</LINE>
<LINE>Never to wash his face, nor cut his hairs:</LINE>
<LINE>He puts on sackcloth, and to sea. He bears</LINE>
<LINE>A tempest, which his mortal vessel tears,</LINE>
<LINE>And yet he rides it out. Now please you wit.</LINE>
<LINE>The epitaph is for Marina writ</LINE>
<LINE>By wicked Dionyza.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Reads the inscription on MARINA's monument</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>'The fairest, sweet'st, and best lies here,</LINE>
<LINE>Who wither'd in her spring of year.</LINE>
<LINE>She was of Tyrus the king's daughter,</LINE>
<LINE>On whom foul death hath made this slaughter;</LINE>
<LINE>Marina was she call'd; and at her birth,</LINE>
<LINE>Thetis, being proud, swallow'd some part o' the earth:</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore the earth, fearing to be o'erflow'd,</LINE>
<LINE>Hath Thetis' birth-child on the heavens bestow'd:</LINE>
<LINE>Wherefore she does, and swears she'll never stint,</LINE>
<LINE>Make raging battery upon shores of flint.'</LINE>
<LINE>No visor does become black villany</LINE>
<LINE>So well as soft and tender flattery.</LINE>
<LINE>Let Pericles believe his daughter's dead,</LINE>
<LINE>And bear his courses to be ordered</LINE>
<LINE>By Lady Fortune; while our scene must play</LINE>
<LINE>His daughter's woe and heavy well-a-day</LINE>
<LINE>In her unholy service. Patience, then,</LINE>
<LINE>And think you now are all in Mytilene.</LINE>

<LINE>No, nor never shall do in such a place as this, she</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Gentleman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But to have divinity preached there! did you ever</LINE>
<LINE>dream of such a thing?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Gentleman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, no. Come, I am for no more bawdy-houses:</LINE>
<LINE>shall's go hear the vestals sing?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<SPEAKER>Pandar</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, I had rather than twice the worth of her she</LINE>
<LINE>had ne'er come here.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Bawd</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fie, fie upon her! she's able to freeze the god</LINE>
<LINE>Priapus, and undo a whole generation. We must</LINE>
<LINE>either get her ravished, or be rid of her. When she</LINE>
<LINE>should do for clients her fitment, and do me the</LINE>
<LINE>kindness of our profession, she has me her quirks,</LINE>
<LINE>her reasons, her master reasons, her prayers, her</LINE>
<LINE>knees; that she would make a puritan of the devil,</LINE>
<LINE>if he should cheapen a kiss of her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BOULT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Faith, I must ravish her, or she'll disfurnish us</LINE>
<LINE>of all our cavaliers, and make our swearers priests.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Pandar</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, the pox upon her green-sickness for me!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Bawd</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Faith, there's no way to be rid on't but by the</LINE>
<LINE>way to the pox. Here comes the Lord Lysimachus disguised.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LYSIMACHUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You may so; 'tis the better for you that your</LINE>

<LINE>wholesome iniquity have you that a man may deal</LINE>
<LINE>withal, and defy the surgeon?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>We have here one, sir, if she would--but there never</LINE>

<SPEAKER>LYSIMACHUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, prithee?</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BOULT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, sir, I can be modest.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Why, your herb-woman; she that sets seeds and roots</LINE>

<LINE>of my power, and so stand aloof for more serious</LINE>
<LINE>wooing. But I protest to thee, pretty one, my</LINE>

<LINE>Have placed me in this sty, where, since I came,</LINE>
<LINE>Diseases have been sold dearer than physic,</LINE>
<LINE>O, that the gods</LINE>
<LINE>Would set me free from this unhallow'd place,</LINE>

<SPEAKER>LYSIMACHUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I did not think</LINE>
<LINE>Thou couldst have spoke so well; ne'er dream'd thou couldst.</LINE>
<LINE>Had I brought hither a corrupted mind,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy speech had alter'd it. Hold, here's gold for thee:</LINE>

<LINE>Fare thee well. Thou art a piece of virtue, and</LINE>
<LINE>I doubt not but thy training hath been noble.</LINE>
<LINE>Hold, here's more gold for thee.</LINE>
<LINE>A curse upon him, die he like a thief,</LINE>

<SPEAKER>BOULT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, mistress; come your ways with me.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Whither wilt thou have me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BOULT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To take from you the jewel you hold so dear.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Prithee, tell me one thing first.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BOULT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come now, your one thing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What canst thou wish thine enemy to be?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BOULT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, I could wish him to be my master, or rather, my mistress.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Neither of these are so bad as thou art,</LINE>
<LINE>Since they do better thee in their command.</LINE>
<LINE>Thou hold'st a place, for which the pained'st fiend</LINE>
<LINE>Of hell would not in reputation change:</LINE>
<LINE>Thou art the damned doorkeeper to every</LINE>
<LINE>Coistrel that comes inquiring for his Tib;</LINE>
<LINE>To the choleric fisting of every rogue</LINE>
<LINE>Thy ear is liable; thy food is such</LINE>
<LINE>As hath been belch'd on by infected lungs.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BOULT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What would you have me do? go to the wars, would</LINE>
<LINE>you? where a man may serve seven years for the loss</LINE>
<LINE>of a leg, and have not money enough in the end to</LINE>
<LINE>buy him a wooden one?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do any thing but this thou doest. Empty</LINE>
<LINE>Old receptacles, or common shores, of filth;</LINE>
<LINE>Serve by indenture to the common hangman:</LINE>
<LINE>Any of these ways are yet better than this;</LINE>
<LINE>For what thou professest, a baboon, could he speak,</LINE>
<LINE>Would own a name too dear. O, that the gods</LINE>
<LINE>Would safely deliver me from this place!</LINE>
<LINE>Here, here's gold for thee.</LINE>
<LINE>If that thy master would gain by thee,</LINE>
<LINE>Proclaim that I can sing, weave, sew, and dance,</LINE>
<LINE>With other virtues, which I'll keep from boast:</LINE>
<LINE>And I will undertake all these to teach.</LINE>
<LINE>I doubt not but this populous city will</LINE>
<LINE>Yield many scholars.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BOULT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But can you teach all this you speak of?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Prove that I cannot, take me home again,</LINE>
<LINE>And prostitute me to the basest groom</LINE>
<LINE>That doth frequent your house.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BOULT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, I will see what I can do for thee: if I can</LINE>
<LINE>place thee, I will.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But amongst honest women.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BOULT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Faith, my acquaintance lies little amongst them.</LINE>
<LINE>But since my master and mistress have bought you,</LINE>
<LINE>there's no going but by their consent: therefore I</LINE>
<LINE>will make them acquainted with your purpose, and I</LINE>
<LINE>doubt not but I shall find them tractable enough.</LINE>

</PROLOGUE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE I.  On board PERICLES' ship, off Mytilene. A close pavilion on deck, with a curtain before it; PERICLES within it, reclined on a couch. A barge lying beside the Tyrian vessel.</TITLE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter two Sailors, one belonging to the Tyrian
vessel, the other to the barge; to them HELICANUS</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Tyrian Sailor</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>To the Sailor of Mytilene</STAGEDIR>  Where is lord Helicanus?</LINE>
<LINE>he can resolve you.</LINE>
<LINE>O, here he is.</LINE>
<LINE>Sir, there's a barge put off from Mytilene,</LINE>
<LINE>And in it is Lysimachus the governor,</LINE>
<LINE>Who craves to come aboard. What is your will?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELICANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That he have his. Call up some gentlemen.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Tyrian Sailor</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ho, gentlemen! my lord calls.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter two or three Gentlemen</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Gentleman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Doth your lordship call?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELICANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Gentlemen, there's some of worth would come aboard;</LINE>
<LINE>I pray ye, greet them fairly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>The Gentlemen and the two Sailors descend, and go
on board the barge</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>Enter, from thence, LYSIMACHUS and Lords; with the
Gentlemen and the two Sailors</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Tyrian Sailor</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir,</LINE>
<LINE>This is the man that can, in aught you would,</LINE>
<LINE>Resolve you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LYSIMACHUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hail, reverend sir! the gods preserve you!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELICANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And you, sir, to outlive the age I am,</LINE>
<LINE>And die as I would do.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LYSIMACHUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You wish me well.</LINE>
<LINE>Being on shore, honouring of Neptune's triumphs,</LINE>
<LINE>Seeing this goodly vessel ride before us,</LINE>
<LINE>I made to it, to know of whence you are.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELICANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>First, what is your place?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LYSIMACHUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am the governor of this place you lie before.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELICANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir,</LINE>
<LINE>Our vessel is of Tyre, in it the king;</LINE>
<LINE>A man who for this three months hath not spoken</LINE>
<LINE>To any one, nor taken sustenance</LINE>
<LINE>But to prorogue his grief.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LYSIMACHUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Upon what ground is his distemperature?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELICANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Twould be too tedious to repeat;</LINE>
<LINE>But the main grief springs from the loss</LINE>
<LINE>Of a beloved daughter and a wife.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LYSIMACHUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>May we not see him?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELICANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You may;</LINE>
<LINE>But bootless is your sight: he will not speak To any.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LYSIMACHUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yet let me obtain my wish.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELICANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Behold him.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>PERICLES discovered</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>This was a goodly person,</LINE>
<LINE>Till the disaster that, one mortal night,</LINE>
<LINE>Drove him to this.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LYSIMACHUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir king, all hail! the gods preserve you!</LINE>
<LINE>Hail, royal sir!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELICANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is in vain; he will not speak to you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir,</LINE>
<LINE>We have a maid in Mytilene, I durst wager,</LINE>
<LINE>Would win some words of him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LYSIMACHUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis well bethought.</LINE>
<LINE>She questionless with her sweet harmony</LINE>
<LINE>And other chosen attractions, would allure,</LINE>
<LINE>And make a battery through his deafen'd parts,</LINE>
<LINE>Which now are midway stopp'd:</LINE>
<LINE>She is all happy as the fairest of all,</LINE>
<LINE>And, with her fellow maids is now upon</LINE>
<LINE>The leafy shelter that abuts against</LINE>
<LINE>The island's side.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Whispers a Lord, who goes off in the barge of
LYSIMACHUS</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELICANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sure, all's effectless; yet nothing we'll omit</LINE>
<LINE>That bears recovery's name. But, since your kindness</LINE>
<LINE>We have stretch'd thus far, let us beseech you</LINE>
<LINE>That for our gold we may provision have,</LINE>
<LINE>Wherein we are not destitute for want,</LINE>
<LINE>But weary for the staleness.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LYSIMACHUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, sir, a courtesy</LINE>
<LINE>Which if we should deny, the most just gods</LINE>
<LINE>For every graff would send a caterpillar,</LINE>
<LINE>And so afflict our province. Yet once more</LINE>
<LINE>Let me entreat to know at large the cause</LINE>
<LINE>Of your king's sorrow.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELICANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sit, sir, I will recount it to you:</LINE>
<LINE>But, see, I am prevented.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Re-enter, from the barge, Lord, with MARINA, and a
young Lady</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LYSIMACHUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, here is</LINE>
<LINE>The lady that I sent for. Welcome, fair one!</LINE>
<LINE>Is't not a goodly presence?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELICANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She's a gallant lady.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LYSIMACHUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She's such a one, that, were I well assured</LINE>
<LINE>Came of a gentle kind and noble stock,</LINE>
<LINE>I'ld wish no better choice, and think me rarely wed.</LINE>
<LINE>Fair one, all goodness that consists in bounty</LINE>
<LINE>Expect even here, where is a kingly patient:</LINE>
<LINE>If that thy prosperous and artificial feat</LINE>
<LINE>Can draw him but to answer thee in aught,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy sacred physic shall receive such pay</LINE>
<LINE>As thy desires can wish.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, I will use</LINE>
<LINE>My utmost skill in his recovery, Provided</LINE>
<LINE>That none but I and my companion maid</LINE>
<LINE>Be suffer'd to come near him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LYSIMACHUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, let us leave her;</LINE>
<LINE>And the gods make her prosperous!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>MARINA sings</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LYSIMACHUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Mark'd he your music?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, nor look'd on us.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LYSIMACHUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>See, she will speak to him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hail, sir! my lord, lend ear.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hum, ha!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am a maid,</LINE>
<LINE>My lord, that ne'er before invited eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>But have been gazed on like a comet: she speaks,</LINE>
<LINE>My lord, that, may be, hath endured a grief</LINE>
<LINE>Might equal yours, if both were justly weigh'd.</LINE>
<LINE>Though wayward fortune did malign my state,</LINE>
<LINE>My derivation was from ancestors</LINE>
<LINE>Who stood equivalent with mighty kings:</LINE>
<LINE>But time hath rooted out my parentage,</LINE>
<LINE>And to the world and awkward casualties</LINE>
<LINE>Bound me in servitude.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>I will desist;</LINE>
<LINE>But there is something glows upon my cheek,</LINE>
<LINE>And whispers in mine ear, 'Go not till he speak.'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My fortunes--parentage--good parentage--</LINE>
<LINE>To equal mine!--was it not thus? what say you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I said, my lord, if you did know my parentage,</LINE>
<LINE>You would not do me violence.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do think so. Pray you, turn your eyes upon me.</LINE>
<LINE>You are like something that--What country-woman?</LINE>
<LINE>Here of these shores?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, nor of any shores:</LINE>
<LINE>Yet I was mortally brought forth, and am</LINE>
<LINE>No other than I appear.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am great with woe, and shall deliver weeping.</LINE>
<LINE>My dearest wife was like this maid, and such a one</LINE>
<LINE>My daughter might have been: my queen's square brows;</LINE>
<LINE>Her stature to an inch; as wand-like straight;</LINE>
<LINE>As silver-voiced; her eyes as jewel-like</LINE>
<LINE>And cased as richly; in pace another Juno;</LINE>
<LINE>Who starves the ears she feeds, and makes them hungry,</LINE>
<LINE>The more she gives them speech. Where do you live?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where I am but a stranger: from the deck</LINE>
<LINE>You may discern the place.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where were you bred?</LINE>
<LINE>And how achieved you these endowments, which</LINE>
<LINE>You make more rich to owe?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If I should tell my history, it would seem</LINE>
<LINE>Like lies disdain'd in the reporting.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Prithee, speak:</LINE>
<LINE>Falseness cannot come from thee; for thou look'st</LINE>
<LINE>Modest as Justice, and thou seem'st a palace</LINE>
<LINE>For the crown'd Truth to dwell in: I will</LINE>
<LINE>believe thee,</LINE>
<LINE>And make my senses credit thy relation</LINE>
<LINE>To points that seem impossible; for thou look'st</LINE>
<LINE>Like one I loved indeed. What were thy friends?</LINE>
<LINE>Didst thou not say, when I did push thee back--</LINE>
<LINE>Which was when I perceived thee--that thou camest</LINE>
<LINE>From good descending?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So indeed I did.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Report thy parentage. I think thou said'st</LINE>
<LINE>Thou hadst been toss'd from wrong to injury,</LINE>
<LINE>And that thou thought'st thy griefs might equal mine,</LINE>
<LINE>If both were open'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Some such thing</LINE>
<LINE>I said, and said no more but what my thoughts</LINE>
<LINE>Did warrant me was likely.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tell thy story;</LINE>
<LINE>If thine consider'd prove the thousandth part</LINE>
<LINE>Of my endurance, thou art a man, and I</LINE>
<LINE>Have suffer'd like a girl: yet thou dost look</LINE>
<LINE>Like Patience gazing on kings' graves, and smiling</LINE>
<LINE>Extremity out of act. What were thy friends?</LINE>
<LINE>How lost thou them? Thy name, my most kind virgin?</LINE>
<LINE>Recount, I do beseech thee: come, sit by me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My name is Marina.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, I am mock'd,</LINE>
<LINE>And thou by some incensed god sent hither</LINE>
<LINE>To make the world to laugh at me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Patience, good sir,</LINE>
<LINE>Or here I'll cease.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, I'll be patient.</LINE>
<LINE>Thou little know'st how thou dost startle me,</LINE>
<LINE>To call thyself Marina.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The name</LINE>
<LINE>Was given me by one that had some power,</LINE>
<LINE>My father, and a king.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How! a king's daughter?</LINE>
<LINE>And call'd Marina?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You said you would believe me;</LINE>
<LINE>But, not to be a troubler of your peace,</LINE>
<LINE>I will end here.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But are you flesh and blood?</LINE>
<LINE>Have you a working pulse? and are no fairy?</LINE>
<LINE>Motion! Well; speak on. Where were you born?</LINE>
<LINE>And wherefore call'd Marina?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Call'd Marina</LINE>
<LINE>For I was born at sea.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>At sea! what mother?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My mother was the daughter of a king;</LINE>
<LINE>Who died the minute I was born,</LINE>
<LINE>As my good nurse Lychorida hath oft</LINE>
<LINE>Deliver'd weeping.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, stop there a little!</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>This is the rarest dream that e'er dull sleep</LINE>
<LINE>Did mock sad fools withal: this cannot be:</LINE>
<LINE>My daughter's buried. Well: where were you bred?</LINE>
<LINE>I'll hear you more, to the bottom of your story,</LINE>
<LINE>And never interrupt you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You scorn: believe me, 'twere best I did give o'er.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will believe you by the syllable</LINE>
<LINE>Of what you shall deliver. Yet, give me leave:</LINE>
<LINE>How came you in these parts? where were you bred?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The king my father did in Tarsus leave me;</LINE>
<LINE>Till cruel Cleon, with his wicked wife,</LINE>
<LINE>Did seek to murder me: and having woo'd</LINE>
<LINE>A villain to attempt it, who having drawn to do't,</LINE>
<LINE>A crew of pirates came and rescued me;</LINE>
<LINE>Brought me to Mytilene. But, good sir,</LINE>
<LINE>Whither will you have me? Why do you weep?</LINE>
<LINE>It may be,</LINE>
<LINE>You think me an impostor: no, good faith;</LINE>
<LINE>I am the daughter to King Pericles,</LINE>
<LINE>If good King Pericles be.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ho, Helicanus!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELICANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Calls my lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou art a grave and noble counsellor,</LINE>
<LINE>Most wise in general: tell me, if thou canst,</LINE>
<LINE>What this maid is, or what is like to be,</LINE>
<LINE>That thus hath made me weep?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELICANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know not; but</LINE>
<LINE>Here is the regent, sir, of Mytilene</LINE>
<LINE>Speaks nobly of her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LYSIMACHUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She would never tell</LINE>
<LINE>Her parentage; being demanded that,</LINE>
<LINE>She would sit still and weep.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O Helicanus, strike me, honour'd sir;</LINE>
<LINE>Give me a gash, put me to present pain;</LINE>
<LINE>Lest this great sea of joys rushing upon me</LINE>
<LINE>O'erbear the shores of my mortality,</LINE>
<LINE>And drown me with their sweetness. O, come hither,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou that beget'st him that did thee beget;</LINE>
<LINE>Thou that wast born at sea, buried at Tarsus,</LINE>
<LINE>And found at sea again! O Helicanus,</LINE>
<LINE>Down on thy knees, thank the holy gods as loud</LINE>
<LINE>As thunder threatens us: this is Marina.</LINE>
<LINE>What was thy mother's name? tell me but that,</LINE>
<LINE>For truth can never be confirm'd enough,</LINE>
<LINE>Though doubts did ever sleep.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>First, sir, I pray,</LINE>
<LINE>What is your title?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am Pericles of Tyre: but tell me now</LINE>
<LINE>My drown'd queen's name, as in the rest you said</LINE>
<LINE>Thou hast been godlike perfect,</LINE>
<LINE>The heir of kingdoms and another like</LINE>
<LINE>To Pericles thy father.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is it no more to be your daughter than</LINE>
<LINE>To say my mother's name was Thaisa?</LINE>
<LINE>Thaisa was my mother, who did end</LINE>
<LINE>The minute I began.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, blessing on thee! rise; thou art my child.</LINE>
<LINE>Give me fresh garments. Mine own, Helicanus;</LINE>
<LINE>She is not dead at Tarsus, as she should have been,</LINE>
<LINE>By savage Cleon: she shall tell thee all;</LINE>
<LINE>When thou shalt kneel, and justify in knowledge</LINE>
<LINE>She is thy very princess. Who is this?</LINE>

<LINE>Sir, 'tis the governor of Mytilene,</LINE>
<LINE>Who, hearing of your melancholy state,</LINE>
<LINE>Did come to see you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I embrace you.</LINE>
<LINE>Give me my robes. I am wild in my beholding.</LINE>
<LINE>O heavens bless my girl! But, hark, what music?</LINE>
<LINE>Tell Helicanus, my Marina, tell him</LINE>
<LINE>O'er, point by point, for yet he seems to doubt,</LINE>
<LINE>How sure you are my daughter. But, what music?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELICANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, I hear none.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Most heavenly music!</LINE>
<LINE>It nips me unto listening, and thick slumber</LINE>
<LINE>Hangs upon mine eyes: let me rest.</LINE>

<LINE>And do upon mine altar sacrifice.</LINE>
<LINE>There, when my maiden priests are met together,</LINE>
<LINE>Before the people all,</LINE>
<LINE>Reveal how thou at sea didst lose thy wife:</LINE>
<LINE>To mourn thy crosses, with thy daughter's, call</LINE>
<LINE>And give them repetition to the life.</LINE>
<LINE>Or perform my bidding, or thou livest in woe;</LINE>
<LINE>Do it, and happy; by my silver bow!</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My purpose was for Tarsus, there to strike</LINE>
<LINE>The inhospitable Cleon; but I am</LINE>
<LINE>For other service first: toward Ephesus</LINE>
<LINE>Turn our blown sails; eftsoons I'll tell thee why.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>To LYSIMACHUS</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Shall we refresh us, sir, upon your shore,</LINE>
<LINE>And give you gold for such provision</LINE>
<LINE>As our intents will need?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEAKER>LYSIMACHUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir,</LINE>
<LINE>With all my heart; and, when you come ashore,</LINE>
<LINE>I have another suit.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You shall prevail,</LINE>
<LINE>Were it to woo my daughter; for it seems</LINE>
<LINE>You have been noble towards her.</LINE>

<LINE>Now our sands are almost run;</LINE>
<LINE>More a little, and then dumb.</LINE>
<LINE>This, my last boon, give me,</LINE>
<LINE>For such kindness must relieve me,</LINE>
<LINE>That you aptly will suppose</LINE>
<LINE>What pageantry, what feats, what shows,</LINE>
<LINE>What minstrelsy, and pretty din,</LINE>
<LINE>The regent made in Mytilene</LINE>
<LINE>To greet the king. So he thrived,</LINE>
<LINE>That he is promised to be wived</LINE>
<LINE>To fair Marina; but in no wise</LINE>
<LINE>Till he had done his sacrifice,</LINE>
<LINE>As Dian bade: whereto being bound,</LINE>
<LINE>The interim, pray you, all confound.</LINE>
<LINE>In feather'd briefness sails are fill'd,</LINE>
<LINE>And wishes fall out as they're will'd.</LINE>
<LINE>At Ephesus, the temple see,</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter PERICLES, with his train; LYSIMACHUS,
HELICANUS, MARINA, and a Lady</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hail, Dian! to perform thy just command,</LINE>
<LINE>I here confess myself the king of Tyre;</LINE>
<LINE>Who, frighted from my country, did wed</LINE>
<LINE>At Pentapolis the fair Thaisa.</LINE>
<LINE>At sea in childbed died she, but brought forth</LINE>
<LINE>A maid-child call'd Marina; who, O goddess,</LINE>
<LINE>Wears yet thy silver livery. She at Tarsus</LINE>
<LINE>Was nursed with Cleon; who at fourteen years</LINE>
<LINE>He sought to murder: but her better stars</LINE>
<LINE>Brought her to Mytilene; 'gainst whose shore</LINE>
<LINE>Riding, her fortunes brought the maid aboard us,</LINE>
<LINE>Where, by her own most clear remembrance, she</LINE>
<LINE>Made known herself my daughter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THAISA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Voice and favour!</LINE>
<LINE>You are, you are--O royal Pericles!</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What means the nun? she dies! help, gentlemen!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CERIMON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Noble sir,</LINE>
<LINE>If you have told Diana's altar true,</LINE>
<LINE>This is your wife.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Reverend appearer, no;</LINE>
<LINE>I threw her overboard with these very arms.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CERIMON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Upon this coast, I warrant you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis most certain.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CERIMON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Look to the lady; O, she's but o'erjoy'd.</LINE>
<LINE>Early in blustering morn this lady was</LINE>
<LINE>Thrown upon this shore. I oped the coffin,</LINE>
<LINE>Found there rich jewels; recover'd her, and placed her</LINE>
<LINE>Here in Diana's temple.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>May we see them?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CERIMON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Great sir, they shall be brought you to my house,</LINE>
<LINE>Whither I invite you. Look, Thaisa is recovered.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THAISA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, let me look!</LINE>
<LINE>If he be none of mine, my sanctity</LINE>
<LINE>Will to my sense bend no licentious ear,</LINE>
<LINE>But curb it, spite of seeing. O, my lord,</LINE>
<LINE>Are you not Pericles? Like him you spake,</LINE>
<LINE>Like him you are: did you not name a tempest,</LINE>
<LINE>A birth, and death?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The voice of dead Thaisa!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THAISA</SPEAKER>

<LINE>And drown'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Immortal Dian!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THAISA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now I know you better.</LINE>
<LINE>When we with tears parted Pentapolis,</LINE>
<LINE>The king my father gave you such a ring.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Shows a ring</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This, this: no more, you gods! your present kindness</LINE>
<LINE>Makes my past miseries sports: you shall do well,</LINE>
<LINE>That on the touching of her lips I may</LINE>
<LINE>Melt and no more be seen. O, come, be buried</LINE>
<LINE>A second time within these arms.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My heart</LINE>
<LINE>Leaps to be gone into my mother's bosom.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Kneels to THAISA</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Look, who kneels here! Flesh of thy flesh, Thaisa;</LINE>
<LINE>Thy burden at the sea, and call'd Marina</LINE>
<LINE>For she was yielded there.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THAISA</SPEAKER>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THAISA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know you not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You have heard me say, when I did fly from Tyre,</LINE>
<LINE>I left behind an ancient substitute:</LINE>
<LINE>Can you remember what I call'd the man?</LINE>
<LINE>I have named him oft.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THAISA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Twas Helicanus then.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Still confirmation:</LINE>
<LINE>Embrace him, dear Thaisa; this is he.</LINE>
<LINE>Now do I long to hear how you were found;</LINE>
<LINE>How possibly preserved; and who to thank,</LINE>
<LINE>Besides the gods, for this great miracle.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THAISA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lord Cerimon, my lord; this man,</LINE>
<LINE>Through whom the gods have shown their power; that can</LINE>
<LINE>From first to last resolve you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Reverend sir,</LINE>
<LINE>The gods can have no mortal officer</LINE>
<LINE>More like a god than you. Will you deliver</LINE>
<LINE>How this dead queen re-lives?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CERIMON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will, my lord.</LINE>
<LINE>Beseech you, first go with me to my house,</LINE>
<LINE>Where shall be shown you all was found with her;</LINE>
<LINE>How she came placed here in the temple;</LINE>
<LINE>No needful thing omitted.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pure Dian, bless thee for thy vision! I</LINE>
<LINE>Will offer night-oblations to thee. Thaisa,</LINE>
<LINE>This prince, the fair-betrothed of your daughter,</LINE>
<LINE>Shall marry her at Pentapolis. And now,</LINE>
<LINE>This ornament</LINE>
<LINE>Makes me look dismal will I clip to form;</LINE>
<LINE>And what this fourteen years no razor touch'd,</LINE>
<LINE>To grace thy marriage-day, I'll beautify.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THAISA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lord Cerimon hath letters of good credit, sir,</LINE>
<LINE>My father's dead.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PERICLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Heavens make a star of him! Yet there, my queen,</LINE>
<LINE>We'll celebrate their nuptials, and ourselves</LINE>
<LINE>Will in that kingdom spend our following days:</LINE>
<LINE>Our son and daughter shall in Tyrus reign.</LINE>
<LINE>Lord Cerimon, we do our longing stay</LINE>
<LINE>To hear the rest untold: sir, lead's the way.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>GOWER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In Antiochus and his daughter you have heard</LINE>
<LINE>Of monstrous lust the due and just reward:</LINE>
<LINE>In Pericles, his queen and daughter, seen,</LINE>
<LINE>Although assail'd with fortune fierce and keen,</LINE>
<LINE>Virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast,</LINE>
<LINE>Led on by heaven, and crown'd with joy at last:</LINE>
<LINE>In Helicanus may you well descry</LINE>
<LINE>A figure of truth, of faith, of loyalty:</LINE>
<LINE>In reverend Cerimon there well appears</LINE>
<LINE>The worth that learned charity aye wears:</LINE>
<LINE>For wicked Cleon and his wife, when fame</LINE>
<LINE>Had spread their cursed deed, and honour'd name</LINE>
<LINE>Of Pericles, to rage the city turn,</LINE>
<LINE>That him and his they in his palace burn;</LINE>
<LINE>The gods for murder seemed so content</LINE>
<LINE>To punish them; although not done, but meant.</LINE>
<LINE>So, on your patience evermore attending,</LINE>
<LINE>New joy wait on you! Here our play has ending.</LINE>
