<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR HUGH EVANS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The tevil and his tam! what phrase is this, 'He</LINE>
<LINE>hears with ear'? why, it is affectations.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pistol, did you pick Master Slender's purse?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SLENDER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, by these gloves, did he, or I would I might</LINE>
<LINE>never come in mine own great chamber again else, of</LINE>
<LINE>seven groats in mill-sixpences, and two Edward</LINE>
<LINE>shovel-boards, that cost me two shilling and two</LINE>
<LINE>pence apiece of Yead Miller, by these gloves.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is this true, Pistol?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR HUGH EVANS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No; it is false, if it is a pick-purse.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PISTOL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ha, thou mountain-foreigner! Sir John and Master mine,</LINE>
<LINE>I combat challenge of this latten bilbo.</LINE>

<LINE>humour on me; that is the very note of it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SLENDER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By this hat, then, he in the red face had it; for</LINE>
<LINE>though I cannot remember what I did when you made me</LINE>
<LINE>drunk, yet I am not altogether an ass.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What say you, Scarlet and John?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BARDOLPH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, sir, for my part I say the gentleman had drunk</LINE>
<LINE>himself out of his five sentences.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR HUGH EVANS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is his five senses: fie, what the ignorance is!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BARDOLPH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And being fap, sir, was, as they say, cashiered; and</LINE>
<LINE>so conclusions passed the careires.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SLENDER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, you spake in Latin then too; but 'tis no</LINE>
<LINE>matter: I'll ne'er be drunk whilst I live again,</LINE>
<LINE>but in honest, civil, godly company, for this trick:</LINE>
<LINE>if I be drunk, I'll be drunk with those that have</LINE>
<LINE>the fear of God, and not with drunken knaves.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR HUGH EVANS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So Got udge me, that is a virtuous mind.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIMPLE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Book of Riddles! why, did you not lend it to Alice</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SHALLOW</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, coz; come, coz; we stay for you. A word with</LINE>

<LINE>here. Do you understand me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SLENDER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, sir, you shall find me reasonable; if it be so,</LINE>
<LINE>I shall do that that is reason.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Nay, but understand me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SLENDER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So I do, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR HUGH EVANS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Give ear to his motions, Master Slender: I will</LINE>
<LINE>description the matter to you, if you be capacity of it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SLENDER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, I will do as my cousin Shallow says: I pray</LINE>
<LINE>you, pardon me; he's a justice of peace in his</LINE>
<LINE>country, simple though I stand here.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR HUGH EVANS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But that is not the question: the question is</LINE>
<LINE>concerning your marriage.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SHALLOW</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, there's the point, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR HUGH EVANS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, is it; the very point of it; to Mistress Anne Page.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SLENDER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, if it be so, I will marry her upon any</LINE>
<LINE>reasonable demands.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR HUGH EVANS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But can you affection the 'oman? Let us command to</LINE>
<LINE>know that of your mouth or of your lips; for divers</LINE>
<LINE>philosophers hold that the lips is parcel of the</LINE>
<LINE>mouth. Therefore, precisely, can you carry your</LINE>
<LINE>good will to the maid?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SHALLOW</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Cousin Abraham Slender, can you love her?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SLENDER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I hope, sir, I will do as it shall become one that</LINE>
<LINE>would do reason.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR HUGH EVANS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, Got's lords and his ladies! you must speak</LINE>
<LINE>possitable, if you can carry her your desires</LINE>
<LINE>towards her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SHALLOW</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That you must. Will you, upon good dowry, marry her?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SLENDER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will do a greater thing than that, upon your</LINE>
<LINE>request, cousin, in any reason.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SHALLOW</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, conceive me, conceive me, sweet coz: what I do</LINE>
<LINE>is to pleasure you, coz. Can you love the maid?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SLENDER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will marry her, sir, at your request: but if there</LINE>
<LINE>be no great love in the beginning, yet heaven may</LINE>
<LINE>decrease it upon better acquaintance, when we are</LINE>
<LINE>married and have more occasion to know one another;</LINE>
<LINE>I hope, upon familiarity will grow more contempt:</LINE>
<LINE>but if you say, 'Marry her,' I will marry her; that</LINE>
<LINE>I am freely dissolved, and dissolutely.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR HUGH EVANS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is a fery discretion answer; save the fall is in</LINE>
<LINE>the ort 'dissolutely:' the ort is, according to our</LINE>
<LINE>meaning, 'resolutely:' his meaning is good.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SHALLOW</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, I think my cousin meant well.</LINE>

<LINE>I' faith, I'll eat nothing; I thank you as much as</LINE>

<SPEAKER>ANNE PAGE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I pray you, sir, walk in.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SLENDER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I had rather walk here, I thank you. I bruised</LINE>
<LINE>my shin th' other day with playing at sword and</LINE>
<LINE>dagger with a master of fence; three veneys for a</LINE>
<LINE>dish of stewed prunes; and, by my troth, I cannot</LINE>
<LINE>abide the smell of hot meat since. Why do your</LINE>
<LINE>dogs bark so? be there bears i' the town?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANNE PAGE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I think there are, sir; I heard them talked of.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SLENDER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I love the sport well but I shall as soon quarrel at</LINE>
<LINE>it as any man in England. You are afraid, if you see</LINE>
<LINE>the bear loose, are you not?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANNE PAGE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, indeed, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SLENDER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That's meat and drink to me, now. I have seen</LINE>
<LINE>Sackerson loose twenty times, and have taken him by</LINE>
<LINE>the chain; but, I warrant you, the women have so</LINE>
<LINE>cried and shrieked at it, that it passed: but women,</LINE>
<LINE>indeed, cannot abide 'em; they are very ill-favored</LINE>
<LINE>rough things.</LINE>

<LINE>Truly, mine host, I must turn away some of my</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Bardolph, follow him. A tapster is a good trade:</LINE>
<LINE>an old cloak makes a new jerkin; a withered</LINE>
<LINE>serving-man a fresh tapster. Go; adieu.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BARDOLPH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is a life that I have desired: I will thrive.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>NYM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He was gotten in drink: is not the humour conceited?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am glad I am so acquit of this tinderbox: his</LINE>
<LINE>thefts were too open; his filching was like an</LINE>
<LINE>unskilful singer; he kept not time.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NYM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The good humour is to steal at a minute's rest.</LINE>

<LINE>My honest lads, I will tell you what I am about.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PISTOL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Two yards, and more.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No quips now, Pistol! Indeed, I am in the waist two</LINE>
<LINE>yards about; but I am now about no waste; I am about</LINE>
<LINE>thrift. Briefly, I do mean to make love to Ford's</LINE>
<LINE>wife: I spy entertainment in her; she discourses,</LINE>
<LINE>she carves, she gives the leer of invitation: I</LINE>
<LINE>can construe the action of her familiar style; and</LINE>
<LINE>the hardest voice of her behavior, to be Englished</LINE>
<LINE>rightly, is, 'I am Sir John Falstaff's.'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PISTOL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He hath studied her will, and translated her will,</LINE>
<LINE>out of honesty into English.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NYM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The anchor is deep: will that humour pass?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, the report goes she has all the rule of her</LINE>
<LINE>husband's purse: he hath a legion of angels.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PISTOL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As many devils entertain; and 'To her, boy,' say I.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NYM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The humour rises; it is good: humour me the angels.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have writ me here a letter to her: and here</LINE>
<LINE>another to Page's wife, who even now gave me good</LINE>
<LINE>eyes too, examined my parts with most judicious</LINE>
<LINE>oeillades; sometimes the beam of her view gilded my</LINE>
<LINE>foot, sometimes my portly belly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PISTOL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then did the sun on dunghill shine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NYM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I thank thee for that humour.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, she did so course o'er my exteriors with such a</LINE>
<LINE>greedy intention, that the appetite of her eye did</LINE>
<LINE>seem to scorch me up like a burning-glass! Here's</LINE>
<LINE>another letter to her: she bears the purse too; she</LINE>
<LINE>is a region in Guiana, all gold and bounty. I will</LINE>
<LINE>be cheater to them both, and they shall be</LINE>
<LINE>exchequers to me; they shall be my East and West</LINE>
<LINE>Indies, and I will trade to them both. Go bear thou</LINE>
<LINE>this letter to Mistress Page; and thou this to</LINE>
<LINE>Mistress Ford: we will thrive, lads, we will thrive.</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Shall I Sir Pandarus of Troy become,</LINE>
<LINE>And by my side wear steel? then, Lucifer take all!</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NYM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will run no base humour: here, take the</LINE>
<LINE>humour-letter: I will keep the havior of reputation.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NYM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My humour shall not cool: I will incense Page to</LINE>
<LINE>deal with poison; I will possess him with</LINE>

<LINE>An honest, willing, kind fellow, as ever servant</LINE>
<LINE>shall come in house withal, and, I warrant you, no</LINE>

<LINE>What news? how does pretty Mistress Anne?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS QUICKLY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In truth, sir, and she is pretty, and honest, and</LINE>
<LINE>gentle; and one that is your friend, I can tell you</LINE>
<LINE>that by the way; I praise heaven for it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FENTON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Shall I do any good, thinkest thou? shall I not lose my suit?</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS QUICKLY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Troth, sir, all is in his hands above: but</LINE>
<LINE>notwithstanding, Master Fenton, I'll be sworn on a</LINE>

<LINE>above your eye?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FENTON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, marry, have I; what of that?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS QUICKLY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, thereby hangs a tale: good faith, it is such</LINE>
<LINE>another Nan; but, I detest, an honest maid as ever</LINE>
<LINE>broke bread: we had an hour's talk of that wart. I</LINE>
<LINE>shall never laugh but in that maid's company! But</LINE>
<LINE>indeed she is given too much to allicholy and</LINE>
<LINE>musing: but for you--well, go to.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FENTON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, I shall see her to-day. Hold, there's money</LINE>
<LINE>for thee; let me have thy voice in my behalf: if</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS QUICKLY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Will I? i'faith, that we will; and I will tell your</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter MISTRESS PAGE, with a letter</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS PAGE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, have I scaped love-letters in the holiday-</LINE>
<LINE>time of my beauty, and am I now a subject for them?</LINE>
<LINE>Let me see.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Reads</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>'Ask me no reason why I love you; for though</LINE>
<LINE>Love use Reason for his physician, he admits him</LINE>
<LINE>not for his counsellor. You are not young, no more</LINE>
<LINE>am I; go to then, there's sympathy: you are merry,</LINE>
<LINE>so am I; ha, ha! then there's more sympathy: you</LINE>
<LINE>love sack, and so do I; would you desire better</LINE>
<LINE>sympathy? Let it suffice thee, Mistress Page,--at</LINE>
<LINE>the least, if the love of soldier can suffice,--</LINE>
<LINE>that I love thee. I will not say, pity me; 'tis</LINE>
<LINE>not a soldier-like phrase: but I say, love me. By me,</LINE>
<LINE>Thine own true knight,</LINE>
<LINE>By day or night,</LINE>
<LINE>Or any kind of light,</LINE>
<LINE>With all his might</LINE>
<LINE>For thee to fight,    JOHN FALSTAFF'</LINE>
<LINE>What a Herod of Jewry is this! O wicked</LINE>
<LINE>world! One that is well-nigh worn to pieces with</LINE>
<LINE>age to show himself a young gallant! What an</LINE>
<LINE>unweighed behavior hath this Flemish drunkard</LINE>
<LINE>picked--with the devil's name!--out of my</LINE>
<LINE>conversation, that he dares in this manner assay me?</LINE>
<LINE>Why, he hath not been thrice in my company! What</LINE>
<LINE>should I say to him? I was then frugal of my</LINE>
<LINE>mirth: Heaven forgive me! Why, I'll exhibit a bill</LINE>
<LINE>in the parliament for the putting down of men. How</LINE>
<LINE>shall I be revenged on him? for revenged I will be,</LINE>
<LINE>as sure as his guts are made of puddings.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter MISTRESS FORD</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Mistress Page! trust me, I was going to your house.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS PAGE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And, trust me, I was coming to you. You look very</LINE>
<LINE>ill.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, I'll ne'er believe that; I have to show to the contrary.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS PAGE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Faith, but you do, in my mind.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, I do then; yet I say I could show you to the</LINE>
<LINE>contrary. O Mistress Page, give me some counsel!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS PAGE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What's the matter, woman?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O woman, if it were not for one trifling respect, I</LINE>
<LINE>could come to such honour!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS PAGE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hang the trifle, woman! take the honour. What is</LINE>
<LINE>it? dispense with trifles; what is it?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If I would but go to hell for an eternal moment or so,</LINE>
<LINE>I could be knighted.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS PAGE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What? thou liest! Sir Alice Ford! These knights</LINE>
<LINE>will hack; and so thou shouldst not alter the</LINE>
<LINE>article of thy gentry.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We burn daylight: here, read, read; perceive how I</LINE>
<LINE>might be knighted. I shall think the worse of fat</LINE>
<LINE>men, as long as I have an eye to make difference of</LINE>
<LINE>men's liking: and yet he would not swear; praised</LINE>
<LINE>women's modesty; and gave such orderly and</LINE>
<LINE>well-behaved reproof to all uncomeliness, that I</LINE>
<LINE>would have sworn his disposition would have gone to</LINE>
<LINE>the truth of his words; but they do no more adhere</LINE>
<LINE>and keep place together than the Hundredth Psalm to</LINE>
<LINE>the tune of 'Green Sleeves.' What tempest, I trow,</LINE>
<LINE>threw this whale, with so many tuns of oil in his</LINE>
<LINE>belly, ashore at Windsor? How shall I be revenged</LINE>
<LINE>on him? I think the best way were to entertain him</LINE>
<LINE>with hope, till the wicked fire of lust have melted</LINE>
<LINE>him in his own grease. Did you ever hear the like?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS PAGE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Letter for letter, but that the name of Page and</LINE>
<LINE>Ford differs! To thy great comfort in this mystery</LINE>
<LINE>of ill opinions, here's the twin-brother of thy</LINE>
<LINE>letter: but let thine inherit first; for, I</LINE>
<LINE>protest, mine never shall. I warrant he hath a</LINE>
<LINE>thousand of these letters, writ with blank space for</LINE>
<LINE>different names--sure, more,--and these are of the</LINE>
<LINE>second edition: he will print them, out of doubt;</LINE>
<LINE>for he cares not what he puts into the press, when</LINE>
<LINE>he would put us two. I had rather be a giantess,</LINE>
<LINE>and lie under Mount Pelion. Well, I will find you</LINE>
<LINE>twenty lascivious turtles ere one chaste man.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, this is the very same; the very hand, the very</LINE>
<LINE>words. What doth he think of us?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS PAGE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, I know not: it makes me almost ready to</LINE>
<LINE>wrangle with mine own honesty. I'll entertain</LINE>
<LINE>myself like one that I am not acquainted withal;</LINE>
<LINE>for, sure, unless he know some strain in me, that I</LINE>
<LINE>know not myself, he would never have boarded me in this fury.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Boarding,' call you it? I'll be sure to keep him</LINE>
<LINE>above deck.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS PAGE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So will I if he come under my hatches, I'll never</LINE>
<LINE>to sea again. Let's be revenged on him: let's</LINE>
<LINE>appoint him a meeting; give him a show of comfort in</LINE>
<LINE>his suit and lead him on with a fine-baited delay,</LINE>
<LINE>till he hath pawned his horses to mine host of the Garter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, I will consent to act any villany against him,</LINE>
<LINE>that may not sully the chariness of our honesty. O,</LINE>
<LINE>that my husband saw this letter! it would give</LINE>
<LINE>eternal food to his jealousy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS PAGE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, look where he comes; and my good man too: he's</LINE>
<LINE>as far from jealousy as I am from giving him cause;</LINE>
<LINE>and that I hope is an unmeasurable distance.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You are the happier woman.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, I hope it be not so.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>PISTOL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hope is a curtal dog in some affairs:</LINE>

<SPEAKER>FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, sir, my wife is not young.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PISTOL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He wooes both high and low, both rich and poor,</LINE>
<LINE>Both young and old, one with another, Ford;</LINE>
<LINE>He loves the gallimaufry: Ford, perpend.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What name, sir?</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PISTOL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The horn, I say. Farewell.</LINE>
<LINE>Take heed, have open eye, for thieves do foot by night:</LINE>

<SPEAKER>NYM</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>To PAGE</STAGEDIR>  And this is true; I like not the humour</LINE>
<LINE>of lying. He hath wronged me in some humours: I</LINE>
<LINE>should have borne the humoured letter to her; but I</LINE>
<LINE>have a sword and it shall bite upon my necessity.</LINE>
<LINE>He loves your wife; there's the short and the long.</LINE>
<LINE>My name is Corporal Nym; I speak and I avouch; 'tis</LINE>
<LINE>true: my name is Nym and Falstaff loves your wife.</LINE>
<LINE>Adieu. I love not the humour of bread and cheese,</LINE>
<LINE>and there's the humour of it. Adieu.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You heard what this knave told me, did you not?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAGE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes: and you heard what the other told me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do you think there is truth in them?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAGE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hang 'em, slaves! I do not think the knight would</LINE>
<LINE>offer it: but these that accuse him in his intent</LINE>
<LINE>towards our wives are a yoke of his discarded men;</LINE>
<LINE>very rogues, now they be out of service.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Were they his men?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAGE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, were they.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I like it never the better for that. Does he lie at</LINE>
<LINE>the Garter?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAGE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, marry, does he. If he should intend this voyage</LINE>
<LINE>towards my wife, I would turn her loose to him; and</LINE>
<LINE>what he gets more of her than sharp words, let it</LINE>
<LINE>lie on my head.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do not misdoubt my wife; but I would be loath to</LINE>
<LINE>turn them together. A man may be too confident: I</LINE>
<LINE>would have nothing lie on my head: I cannot be thus satisfied.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAGE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Look where my ranting host of the Garter comes:</LINE>
<LINE>there is either liquor in his pate or money in his</LINE>
<LINE>purse when he looks so merrily.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter Host</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>How now, mine host!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Host</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tell him, cavaleiro-justice; tell him, bully-rook.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Sir, there is a fray to be fought between Sir Hugh</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SHALLOW</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>To PAGE</STAGEDIR>  Will you go with us to behold it? My</LINE>
<LINE>merry host hath had the measuring of their weapons;</LINE>
<LINE>and, I think, hath appointed them contrary places;</LINE>
<LINE>for, believe me, I hear the parson is no jester.</LINE>
<LINE>Hark, I will tell you what our sport shall be.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>They converse apart</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Host</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hast thou no suit against my knight, my</LINE>
<LINE>guest-cavaleire?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>None, I protest: but I'll give you a pottle of</LINE>
<LINE>burnt sack to give me recourse to him and tell him</LINE>
<LINE>my name is Brook; only for a jest.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Host</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My hand, bully; thou shalt have egress and regress;</LINE>
<LINE>--said I well?--and thy name shall be Brook. It is</LINE>
<LINE>a merry knight. Will you go, An-heires?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SHALLOW</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Have with you, mine host.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAGE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have heard the Frenchman hath good skill in</LINE>
<LINE>his rapier.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SHALLOW</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tut, sir, I could have told you more. In these times</LINE>
<LINE>you stand on distance, your passes, stoccadoes, and</LINE>
<LINE>I know not what: 'tis the heart, Master Page; 'tis</LINE>
<LINE>here, 'tis here. I have seen the time, with my long</LINE>
<LINE>sword I would have made you four tall fellows skip like rats.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Host</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here, boys, here, here! shall we wag?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAGE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Have with you. I would rather hear them scold than fight.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt Host, SHALLOW, and PAGE</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Though Page be a secure fool, an stands so firmly</LINE>
<LINE>on his wife's frailty, yet I cannot put off my</LINE>
<LINE>opinion so easily: she was in his company at Page's</LINE>
<LINE>house; and what they made there, I know not. Well,</LINE>
<LINE>I will look further into't: and I have a disguise</LINE>
<LINE>to sound Falstaff. If I find her honest, I lose not</LINE>
<LINE>my labour; if she be otherwise, 'tis labour well bestowed.</LINE>

<LINE>Why, then the world's mine oyster.</LINE>
<LINE>Which I with sword will open.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not a penny. I have been content, sir, you should</LINE>
<LINE>lay my countenance to pawn; I have grated upon my</LINE>
<LINE>good friends for three reprieves for you and your</LINE>
<LINE>coach-fellow Nym; or else you had looked through</LINE>
<LINE>the grate, like a geminy of baboons. I am damned in</LINE>
<LINE>hell for swearing to gentlemen my friends, you were</LINE>
<LINE>good soldiers and tall fellows; and when Mistress</LINE>
<LINE>Bridget lost the handle of her fan, I took't upon</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Reason, you rogue, reason: thinkest thou I'll</LINE>
<LINE>endanger my soul gratis? At a word, hang no more</LINE>
<LINE>about me, I am no gibbet for you. Go. A short knife</LINE>
<LINE>and a throng! To your manor of Pickt-hatch! Go.</LINE>
<LINE>You'll not bear a letter for me, you rogue! you</LINE>
<LINE>stand upon your honour! Why, thou unconfinable</LINE>
<LINE>baseness, it is as much as I can do to keep the</LINE>
<LINE>terms of my honour precise: I, I, I myself</LINE>
<LINE>sometimes, leaving the fear of God on the left hand</LINE>
<LINE>and hiding mine honour in my necessity, am fain to</LINE>
<LINE>shuffle, to hedge and to lurch; and yet you, rogue,</LINE>
<LINE>will ensconce your rags, your cat-a-mountain</LINE>
<LINE>looks, your red-lattice phrases, and your</LINE>
<LINE>bold-beating oaths, under the shelter of your</LINE>

<LINE>There is one Mistress Ford, sir:--I pray, come a</LINE>
<LINE>little nearer this ways:--I myself dwell with master</LINE>
<LINE>Doctor Caius,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, on: Mistress Ford, you say,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS QUICKLY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your worship says very true: I pray your worship,</LINE>
<LINE>come a little nearer this ways.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I warrant thee, nobody hears; mine own people, mine</LINE>
<LINE>own people.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS QUICKLY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Are they so? God bless them and make them his servants!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, Mistress Ford; what of her?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS QUICKLY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, sir, she's a good creature. Lord Lord! your</LINE>
<LINE>worship's a wanton! Well, heaven forgive you and all</LINE>
<LINE>of us, I pray!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Mistress Ford; come, Mistress Ford,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS QUICKLY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, this is the short and the long of it; you</LINE>
<LINE>have brought her into such a canaries as 'tis</LINE>
<LINE>wonderful. The best courtier of them all, when the</LINE>
<LINE>court lay at Windsor, could never have brought her</LINE>
<LINE>to such a canary. Yet there has been knights, and</LINE>
<LINE>lords, and gentlemen, with their coaches, I warrant</LINE>
<LINE>you, coach after coach, letter after letter, gift</LINE>
<LINE>after gift; smelling so sweetly, all musk, and so</LINE>
<LINE>rushling, I warrant you, in silk and gold; and in</LINE>
<LINE>such alligant terms; and in such wine and sugar of</LINE>
<LINE>the best and the fairest, that would have won any</LINE>
<LINE>woman's heart; and, I warrant you, they could never</LINE>
<LINE>get an eye-wink of her: I had myself twenty angels</LINE>
<LINE>given me this morning; but I defy all angels, in</LINE>
<LINE>any such sort, as they say, but in the way of</LINE>
<LINE>honesty: and, I warrant you, they could never get</LINE>
<LINE>her so much as sip on a cup with the proudest of</LINE>
<LINE>them all: and yet there has been earls, nay, which</LINE>
<LINE>is more, pensioners; but, I warrant you, all is one with her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But what says she to me? be brief, my good</LINE>
<LINE>she-Mercury.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS QUICKLY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, she hath received your letter, for the which</LINE>
<LINE>she thanks you a thousand times; and she gives you</LINE>
<LINE>to notify that her husband will be absence from his</LINE>
<LINE>house between ten and eleven.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ten and eleven?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS QUICKLY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, forsooth; and then you may come and see the</LINE>
<LINE>picture, she says, that you wot of: Master Ford,</LINE>
<LINE>her husband, will be from home. Alas! the sweet</LINE>
<LINE>woman leads an ill life with him: he's a very</LINE>
<LINE>jealousy man: she leads a very frampold life with</LINE>
<LINE>him, good heart.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ten and eleven. Woman, commend me to her; I will</LINE>
<LINE>not fail her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS QUICKLY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, you say well. But I have another messenger to</LINE>
<LINE>your worship. Mistress Page hath her hearty</LINE>
<LINE>commendations to you too: and let me tell you in</LINE>
<LINE>your ear, she's as fartuous a civil modest wife, and</LINE>
<LINE>one, I tell you, that will not miss you morning nor</LINE>
<LINE>evening prayer, as any is in Windsor, whoe'er be the</LINE>
<LINE>other: and she bade me tell your worship that her</LINE>
<LINE>husband is seldom from home; but she hopes there</LINE>
<LINE>will come a time. I never knew a woman so dote upon</LINE>
<LINE>a man: surely I think you have charms, la; yes, in truth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not I, I assure thee: setting the attractions of my</LINE>
<LINE>good parts aside I have no other charms.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS QUICKLY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Blessing on your heart for't!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But, I pray thee, tell me this: has Ford's wife and</LINE>
<LINE>Page's wife acquainted each other how they love me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS QUICKLY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That were a jest indeed! they have not so little</LINE>
<LINE>grace, I hope: that were a trick indeed! but</LINE>
<LINE>Mistress Page would desire you to send her your</LINE>
<LINE>little page, of all loves: her husband has a</LINE>
<LINE>marvellous infection to the little page; and truly</LINE>
<LINE>Master Page is an honest man. Never a wife in</LINE>
<LINE>Windsor leads a better life than she does: do what</LINE>
<LINE>she will, say what she will, take all, pay all, go</LINE>
<LINE>to bed when she list, rise when she list, all is as</LINE>
<LINE>she will: and truly she deserves it; for if there</LINE>
<LINE>be a kind woman in Windsor, she is one. You must</LINE>
<LINE>send her your page; no remedy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, I will.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS QUICKLY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, but do so, then: and, look you, he may come and</LINE>
<LINE>go between you both; and in any case have a</LINE>
<LINE>nay-word, that you may know one another's mind, and</LINE>
<LINE>the boy never need to understand any thing; for</LINE>
<LINE>'tis not good that children should know any</LINE>
<LINE>wickedness: old folks, you know, have discretion,</LINE>
<LINE>as they say, and know the world.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fare thee well: commend me to them both: there's</LINE>
<LINE>my purse; I am yet thy debtor. Boy, go along with</LINE>
<LINE>this woman.</LINE>

<LINE>And you, sir! Would you speak with me?</LINE>

<SPEAKER>FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, I am a gentleman that have spent much; my name is Brook.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good Master Brook, I desire more acquaintance of you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good Sir John, I sue for yours: not to charge you;</LINE>
<LINE>for I must let you understand I think myself in</LINE>
<LINE>better plight for a lender than you are: the which</LINE>
<LINE>hath something embolden'd me to this unseasoned</LINE>
<LINE>intrusion; for they say, if money go before, all</LINE>
<LINE>ways do lie open.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Money is a good soldier, sir, and will on.</LINE>

<LINE>Troth, and I have a bag of money here troubles me:</LINE>
<LINE>if you will help to bear it, Sir John, take all, or</LINE>
<LINE>half, for easing me of the carriage.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, I know not how I may deserve to be your porter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will tell you, sir, if you will give me the hearing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Speak, good Master Brook: I shall be glad to be</LINE>
<LINE>your servant.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, I hear you are a scholar,--I will be brief</LINE>
<LINE>with you,--and you have been a man long known to me,</LINE>
<LINE>though I had never so good means, as desire, to make</LINE>
<LINE>myself acquainted with you. I shall discover a</LINE>
<LINE>thing to you, wherein I must very much lay open mine</LINE>
<LINE>own imperfection: but, good Sir John, as you have</LINE>
<LINE>one eye upon my follies, as you hear them unfolded,</LINE>
<LINE>turn another into the register of your own; that I</LINE>
<LINE>may pass with a reproof the easier, sith you</LINE>
<LINE>yourself know how easy it is to be such an offender.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Very well, sir; proceed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There is a gentlewoman in this town; her husband's</LINE>
<LINE>name is Ford.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have long loved her, and, I protest to you,</LINE>
<LINE>bestowed much on her; followed her with a doting</LINE>
<LINE>observance; engrossed opportunities to meet her;</LINE>
<LINE>fee'd every slight occasion that could but niggardly</LINE>
<LINE>give me sight of her; not only bought many presents</LINE>
<LINE>to give her, but have given largely to many to know</LINE>
<LINE>what she would have given; briefly, I have pursued</LINE>
<LINE>her as love hath pursued me; which hath been on the</LINE>
<LINE>wing of all occasions. But whatsoever I have</LINE>
<LINE>merited, either in my mind or, in my means, meed,</LINE>
<LINE>I am sure, I have received none; unless experience</LINE>
<LINE>be a jewel that I have purchased at an infinite</LINE>
<LINE>rate, and that hath taught me to say this:</LINE>
<LINE>'Love like a shadow flies when substance love pursues;</LINE>
<LINE>Pursuing that that flies, and flying what pursues.'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Have you received no promise of satisfaction at her hands?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Never.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Have you importuned her to such a purpose?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Never.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Of what quality was your love, then?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Like a fair house built on another man's ground; so</LINE>
<LINE>that I have lost my edifice by mistaking the place</LINE>
<LINE>where I erected it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To what purpose have you unfolded this to me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>When I have told you that, I have told you all.</LINE>
<LINE>Some say, that though she appear honest to me, yet in</LINE>
<LINE>other places she enlargeth her mirth so far that</LINE>
<LINE>there is shrewd construction made of her. Now, Sir</LINE>
<LINE>John, here is the heart of my purpose: you are a</LINE>
<LINE>gentleman of excellent breeding, admirable</LINE>
<LINE>discourse, of great admittance, authentic in your</LINE>
<LINE>place and person, generally allowed for your many</LINE>
<LINE>war-like, court-like, and learned preparations.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, sir!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Believe it, for you know it. There is money; spend</LINE>
<LINE>it, spend it; spend more; spend all I have; only</LINE>
<LINE>give me so much of your time in exchange of it, as</LINE>
<LINE>to lay an amiable siege to the honesty of this</LINE>
<LINE>Ford's wife: use your art of wooing; win her to</LINE>
<LINE>consent to you: if any man may, you may as soon as</LINE>
<LINE>any.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Would it apply well to the vehemency of your</LINE>
<LINE>affection, that I should win what you would enjoy?</LINE>
<LINE>Methinks you prescribe to yourself very preposterously.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, understand my drift. She dwells so securely on</LINE>
<LINE>the excellency of her honour, that the folly of my</LINE>
<LINE>soul dares not present itself: she is too bright to</LINE>
<LINE>be looked against. Now, could I could come to her</LINE>
<LINE>with any detection in my hand, my desires had</LINE>
<LINE>instance and argument to commend themselves: I</LINE>
<LINE>could drive her then from the ward of her purity,</LINE>
<LINE>her reputation, her marriage-vow, and a thousand</LINE>
<LINE>other her defences, which now are too too strongly</LINE>
<LINE>embattled against me. What say you to't, Sir John?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Master Brook, I will first make bold with your</LINE>
<LINE>money; next, give me your hand; and last, as I am a</LINE>
<LINE>gentleman, you shall, if you will, enjoy Ford's wife.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O good sir!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I say you shall.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Want no money, Sir John; you shall want none.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Want no Mistress Ford, Master Brook; you shall want</LINE>
<LINE>none. I shall be with her, I may tell you, by her</LINE>
<LINE>own appointment; even as you came in to me, her</LINE>
<LINE>assistant or go-between parted from me: I say I</LINE>
<LINE>shall be with her between ten and eleven; for at</LINE>
<LINE>that time the jealous rascally knave her husband</LINE>
<LINE>will be forth. Come you to me at night; you shall</LINE>
<LINE>know how I speed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am blest in your acquaintance. Do you know Ford,</LINE>
<LINE>sir?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hang him, poor cuckoldly knave! I know him not:</LINE>
<LINE>yet I wrong him to call him poor; they say the</LINE>
<LINE>jealous wittolly knave hath masses of money; for the</LINE>
<LINE>which his wife seems to me well-favored. I will</LINE>
<LINE>use her as the key of the cuckoldly rogue's coffer;</LINE>
<LINE>and there's my harvest-home.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would you knew Ford, sir, that you might avoid him</LINE>
<LINE>if you saw him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hang him, mechanical salt-butter rogue! I will</LINE>
<LINE>stare him out of his wits; I will awe him with my</LINE>
<LINE>cudgel: it shall hang like a meteor o'er the</LINE>
<LINE>cuckold's horns. Master Brook, thou shalt know I</LINE>
<LINE>will predominate over the peasant, and thou shalt</LINE>
<LINE>lie with his wife. Come to me soon at night.</LINE>
<LINE>Ford's a knave, and I will aggravate his style;</LINE>
<LINE>thou, Master Brook, shalt know him for knave and</LINE>
<LINE>cuckold. Come to me soon at night.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What a damned Epicurean rascal is this! My heart is</LINE>
<LINE>ready to crack with impatience. Who says this is</LINE>
<LINE>improvident jealousy? my wife hath sent to him; the</LINE>
<LINE>hour is fixed; the match is made. Would any man</LINE>
<LINE>have thought this? See the hell of having a false</LINE>
<LINE>woman! My bed shall be abused, my coffers</LINE>
<LINE>ransacked, my reputation gnawn at; and I shall not</LINE>
<LINE>only receive this villanous wrong, but stand under</LINE>
<LINE>the adoption of abominable terms, and by him that</LINE>
<LINE>does me this wrong. Terms! names! Amaimon sounds</LINE>
<LINE>well; Lucifer, well; Barbason, well; yet they are</LINE>
<LINE>devils' additions, the names of fiends: but</LINE>
<LINE>Cuckold! Wittol!--Cuckold! the devil himself hath</LINE>
<LINE>not such a name. Page is an ass, a secure ass: he</LINE>
<LINE>will trust his wife; he will not be jealous. I will</LINE>
<LINE>rather trust a Fleming with my butter, Parson Hugh</LINE>
<LINE>the Welshman with my cheese, an Irishman with my</LINE>
<LINE>aqua-vitae bottle, or a thief to walk my ambling</LINE>
<LINE>gelding, than my wife with herself; then she plots,</LINE>
<LINE>then she ruminates, then she devises; and what they</LINE>
<LINE>think in their hearts they may effect, they will</LINE>
<LINE>break their hearts but they will effect. God be</LINE>
<LINE>praised for my jealousy! Eleven o'clock the hour.</LINE>
<LINE>I will prevent this, detect my wife, be revenged on</LINE>
<LINE>Falstaff, and laugh at Page. I will about it;</LINE>
<LINE>better three hours too soon than a minute too late.</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Truly, sir, to see your wife. Is she at home?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay; and as idle as she may hang together, for want</LINE>
<LINE>of company. I think, if your husbands were dead,</LINE>
<LINE>you two would marry.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS PAGE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Be sure of that,--two other husbands.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Has Page any brains? hath he any eyes? hath he any</LINE>
<LINE>thinking? Sure, they sleep; he hath no use of them.</LINE>
<LINE>Why, this boy will carry a letter twenty mile, as</LINE>
<LINE>easy as a cannon will shoot point-blank twelve</LINE>
<LINE>score. He pieces out his wife's inclination; he</LINE>
<LINE>gives her folly motion and advantage: and now she's</LINE>
<LINE>going to my wife, and Falstaff's boy with her. A</LINE>
<LINE>man may hear this shower sing in the wind. And</LINE>
<LINE>Falstaff's boy with her! Good plots, they are laid;</LINE>
<LINE>and our revolted wives share damnation together.</LINE>
<LINE>Well; I will take him, then torture my wife, pluck</LINE>
<LINE>the borrowed veil of modesty from the so seeming</LINE>
<LINE>Mistress Page, divulge Page himself for a secure and</LINE>
<LINE>wilful Actaeon; and to these violent proceedings all</LINE>
<LINE>my neighbours shall cry aim.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Clock heard</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>The clock gives me my cue, and my assurance bids me</LINE>
<LINE>search: there I shall find Falstaff: I shall be</LINE>
<LINE>rather praised for this than mocked; for it is as</LINE>
<LINE>positive as the earth is firm that Falstaff is</LINE>
<LINE>there: I will go.</LINE>

<LINE>What say you to young Master Fenton? he capers, he</LINE>
<LINE>dances, he has eyes of youth, he writes verses, he</LINE>
<LINE>speaks holiday, he smells April and May: he will</LINE>
<LINE>carry't, he will carry't; 'tis in his buttons; he</LINE>
<LINE>will carry't.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAGE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not by my consent, I promise you. The gentleman is</LINE>
<LINE>of no having: he kept company with the wild prince</LINE>
<LINE>and Poins; he is of too high a region; he knows too</LINE>
<LINE>much. No, he shall not knit a knot in his fortunes</LINE>
<LINE>with the finger of my substance: if he take her,</LINE>
<LINE>let him take her simply; the wealth I have waits on</LINE>
<LINE>my consent, and my consent goes not that way.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I beseech you heartily, some of you go home with me</LINE>
<LINE>to dinner: besides your cheer, you shall have</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Have I caught thee, my heavenly jewel? Why, now let</LINE>
<LINE>me die, for I have lived long enough: this is the</LINE>
<LINE>period of my ambition: O this blessed hour!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O sweet Sir John!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Mistress Ford, I cannot cog, I cannot prate,</LINE>
<LINE>Mistress Ford. Now shall I sin in my wish: I would</LINE>
<LINE>thy husband were dead: I'll speak it before the</LINE>
<LINE>best lord; I would make thee my lady.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I your lady, Sir John! alas, I should be a pitiful lady!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let the court of France show me such another. I see</LINE>
<LINE>how thine eye would emulate the diamond: thou hast</LINE>
<LINE>the right arched beauty of the brow that becomes the</LINE>
<LINE>ship-tire, the tire-valiant, or any tire of</LINE>
<LINE>Venetian admittance.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A plain kerchief, Sir John: my brows become nothing</LINE>
<LINE>else; nor that well neither.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By the Lord, thou art a traitor to say so: thou</LINE>
<LINE>wouldst make an absolute courtier; and the firm</LINE>
<LINE>fixture of thy foot would give an excellent motion</LINE>
<LINE>to thy gait in a semi-circled farthingale. I see</LINE>
<LINE>what thou wert, if Fortune thy foe were not, Nature</LINE>
<LINE>thy friend. Come, thou canst not hide it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Believe me, there is no such thing in me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What made me love thee? let that persuade thee</LINE>
<LINE>there's something extraordinary in thee. Come, I</LINE>
<LINE>cannot cog and say thou art this and that, like a</LINE>
<LINE>many of these lisping hawthorn-buds, that come like</LINE>
<LINE>women in men's apparel, and smell like Bucklersbury</LINE>
<LINE>in simple time; I cannot: but I love thee; none</LINE>
<LINE>but thee; and thou deservest it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do not betray me, sir. I fear you love Mistress Page.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou mightst as well say I love to walk by the</LINE>
<LINE>Counter-gate, which is as hateful to me as the reek</LINE>
<LINE>of a lime-kiln.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, heaven knows how I love you; and you shall one</LINE>
<LINE>day find it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Keep in that mind; I'll deserve it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, I must tell you, so you do; or else I could not</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She shall not see me: I will ensconce me behind the arras.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>MISTRESS PAGE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O Mistress Ford, what have you done? You're shamed,</LINE>
<LINE>you're overthrown, you're undone for ever!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What's the matter, good Mistress Page?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS PAGE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O well-a-day, Mistress Ford! having an honest man</LINE>
<LINE>to your husband, to give him such cause of suspicion!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What cause of suspicion?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS PAGE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What cause of suspicion! Out pon you! how am I</LINE>
<LINE>mistook in you!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, alas, what's the matter?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS PAGE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your husband's coming hither, woman, with all the</LINE>
<LINE>officers in Windsor, to search for a gentleman that</LINE>
<LINE>he says is here now in the house by your consent, to</LINE>
<LINE>take an ill advantage of his assence: you are undone.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis not so, I hope.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS PAGE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pray heaven it be not so, that you have such a man</LINE>
<LINE>here! but 'tis most certain your husband's coming,</LINE>
<LINE>with half Windsor at his heels, to search for such a</LINE>
<LINE>one. I come before to tell you. If you know</LINE>
<LINE>yourself clear, why, I am glad of it; but if you</LINE>
<LINE>have a friend here convey, convey him out. Be not</LINE>
<LINE>amazed; call all your senses to you; defend your</LINE>
<LINE>reputation, or bid farewell to your good life for ever.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What shall I do? There is a gentleman my dear</LINE>
<LINE>friend; and I fear not mine own shame so much as his</LINE>
<LINE>peril: I had rather than a thousand pound he were</LINE>
<LINE>out of the house.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS PAGE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For shame! never stand 'you had rather' and 'you</LINE>
<LINE>had rather:' your husband's here at hand, bethink</LINE>
<LINE>you of some conveyance: in the house you cannot</LINE>
<LINE>hide him. O, how have you deceived me! Look, here</LINE>
<LINE>is a basket: if he be of any reasonable stature, he</LINE>
<LINE>may creep in here; and throw foul linen upon him, as</LINE>
<LINE>if it were going to bucking: or--it is whiting-time</LINE>
<LINE>--send him by your two men to Datchet-mead.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He's too big to go in there. What shall I do?</LINE>

<LINE>Buck! I would I could wash myself of the buck!</LINE>
<LINE>Buck, buck, buck! Ay, buck; I warrant you, buck;</LINE>

<LINE>Is there not a double excellency in this?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know not which pleases me better, that my husband</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS PAGE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What a taking was he in when your husband asked who</LINE>
<LINE>was in the basket!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am half afraid he will have need of washing; so</LINE>
<LINE>throwing him into the water will do him a benefit.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS PAGE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hang him, dishonest rascal! I would all of the same</LINE>
<LINE>strain were in the same distress.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I think my husband hath some special suspicion of</LINE>
<LINE>Falstaff's being here; for I never saw him so gross</LINE>
<LINE>in his jealousy till now.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS PAGE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will lay a plot to try that; and we will yet have</LINE>
<LINE>more tricks with Falstaff: his dissolute disease will</LINE>
<LINE>scarce obey this medicine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Shall we send that foolish carrion, Mistress</LINE>
<LINE>Quickly, to him, and excuse his throwing into the</LINE>
<LINE>water; and give him another hope, to betray him to</LINE>
<LINE>another punishment?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>We will do it: let him be sent for to-morrow,</LINE>

<LINE>Besides these, other bars he lays before me,</LINE>
<LINE>My riots past, my wild societies;</LINE>

<LINE>I should love thee but as a property.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>FENTON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, heaven so speed me in my time to come!</LINE>
<LINE>Albeit I will confess thy father's wealth</LINE>
<LINE>Was the first motive that I woo'd thee, Anne:</LINE>

<SPEAKER>MISTRESS QUICKLY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is my doing, now: 'Nay,' said I, 'will you cast</LINE>
<LINE>away your child on a fool, and a physician? Look on</LINE>
<LINE>Master Fenton:' this is my doing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FENTON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I thank thee; and I pray thee, once to-night</LINE>
<LINE>Give my sweet Nan this ring: there's for thy pains.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS QUICKLY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now heaven send thee good fortune!</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit FENTON</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>A kind heart he hath: a woman would run through</LINE>
<LINE>fire and water for such a kind heart. But yet I</LINE>
<LINE>would my master had Mistress Anne; or I would</LINE>
<LINE>Master Slender had her; or, in sooth, I would Master</LINE>
<LINE>Fenton had her; I will do what I can for them all</LINE>
<LINE>three; for so I have promised, and I'll be as good</LINE>
<LINE>as my word; but speciously for Master Fenton. Well,</LINE>
<LINE>I must of another errand to Sir John Falstaff from</LINE>
<LINE>my two mistresses: what a beast am I to slack it!</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BARDOLPH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go fetch me a quart of sack; put a toast in't.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit BARDOLPH</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Have I lived to be carried in a basket, like a</LINE>
<LINE>barrow of butcher's offal, and to be thrown in the</LINE>
<LINE>Thames? Well, if I be served such another trick,</LINE>
<LINE>I'll have my brains ta'en out and buttered, and give</LINE>
<LINE>them to a dog for a new-year's gift. The rogues</LINE>
<LINE>slighted me into the river with as little remorse as</LINE>
<LINE>they would have drowned a blind bitch's puppies,</LINE>
<LINE>fifteen i' the litter: and you may know by my size</LINE>
<LINE>that I have a kind of alacrity in sinking; if the</LINE>
<LINE>bottom were as deep as hell, I should down. I had</LINE>
<LINE>been drowned, but that the shore was shelvy and</LINE>
<LINE>shallow,--a death that I abhor; for the water swells</LINE>
<LINE>a man; and what a thing should I have been when I</LINE>
<LINE>had been swelled! I should have been a mountain of mummy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Re-enter BARDOLPH with sack</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BARDOLPH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here's Mistress Quickly, sir, to speak with you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let me pour in some sack to the Thames water; for my</LINE>
<LINE>belly's as cold as if I had swallowed snowballs for</LINE>
<LINE>pills to cool the reins. Call her in.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>By your leave; I cry you mercy: give your worship</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Take away these chalices. Go brew me a pottle of</LINE>
<LINE>sack finely.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEAKER>MISTRESS QUICKLY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, sir, I come to your worship from Mistress Ford.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Mistress Ford! I have had ford enough; I was thrown</LINE>
<LINE>into the ford; I have my belly full of ford.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS QUICKLY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alas the day! good heart, that was not her fault:</LINE>
<LINE>she does so take on with her men; they mistook their erection.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So did I mine, to build upon a foolish woman's promise.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS QUICKLY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, she laments, sir, for it, that it would yearn</LINE>
<LINE>your heart to see it. Her husband goes this morning</LINE>
<LINE>a-birding; she desires you once more to come to her</LINE>
<LINE>between eight and nine: I must carry her word</LINE>
<LINE>quickly: she'll make you amends, I warrant you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, I will visit her: tell her so; and bid her</LINE>
<LINE>think what a man is: let her consider his frailty,</LINE>
<LINE>and then judge of my merit.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS QUICKLY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will tell her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do so. Between nine and ten, sayest thou?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Peace be with you, sir.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I marvel I hear not of Master Brook; he sent me word</LINE>
<LINE>to stay within: I like his money well. O, here he comes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter FORD</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Bless you, sir!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, master Brook, you come to know what hath passed</LINE>
<LINE>between me and Ford's wife?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That, indeed, Sir John, is my business.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Master Brook, I will not lie to you: I was at her</LINE>
<LINE>house the hour she appointed me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And sped you, sir?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Very ill-favoredly, Master Brook.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How so, sir? Did she change her determination?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, Master Brook; but the peaking Cornuto her</LINE>
<LINE>husband, Master Brook, dwelling in a continual</LINE>
<LINE>'larum of jealousy, comes me in the instant of our</LINE>
<LINE>encounter, after we had embraced, kissed, protested,</LINE>
<LINE>and, as it were, spoke the prologue of our comedy;</LINE>
<LINE>and at his heels a rabble of his companions, thither</LINE>
<LINE>provoked and instigated by his distemper, and,</LINE>
<LINE>forsooth, to search his house for his wife's love.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, while you were there?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>While I was there.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And did he search for you, and could not find you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You shall hear. As good luck would have it, comes</LINE>
<LINE>in one Mistress Page; gives intelligence of Ford's</LINE>
<LINE>approach; and, in her invention and Ford's wife's</LINE>
<LINE>distraction, they conveyed me into a buck-basket.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A buck-basket!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By the Lord, a buck-basket! rammed me in with foul</LINE>
<LINE>shirts and smocks, socks, foul stockings, greasy</LINE>
<LINE>napkins; that, Master Brook, there was the rankest</LINE>
<LINE>compound of villanous smell that ever offended nostril.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And how long lay you there?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, you shall hear, Master Brook, what I have</LINE>
<LINE>suffered to bring this woman to evil for your good.</LINE>
<LINE>Being thus crammed in the basket, a couple of Ford's</LINE>
<LINE>knaves, his hinds, were called forth by their</LINE>
<LINE>mistress to carry me in the name of foul clothes to</LINE>
<LINE>Datchet-lane: they took me on their shoulders; met</LINE>
<LINE>the jealous knave their master in the door, who</LINE>
<LINE>asked them once or twice what they had in their</LINE>
<LINE>basket: I quaked for fear, lest the lunatic knave</LINE>
<LINE>would have searched it; but fate, ordaining he</LINE>
<LINE>should be a cuckold, held his hand. Well: on went he</LINE>
<LINE>for a search, and away went I for foul clothes. But</LINE>
<LINE>mark the sequel, Master Brook: I suffered the pangs</LINE>
<LINE>of three several deaths; first, an intolerable</LINE>
<LINE>fright, to be detected with a jealous rotten</LINE>
<LINE>bell-wether; next, to be compassed, like a good</LINE>
<LINE>bilbo, in the circumference of a peck, hilt to</LINE>
<LINE>point, heel to head; and then, to be stopped in,</LINE>
<LINE>like a strong distillation, with stinking clothes</LINE>
<LINE>that fretted in their own grease: think of that,--a</LINE>
<LINE>man of my kidney,--think of that,--that am as subject</LINE>
<LINE>to heat as butter; a man of continual dissolution</LINE>
<LINE>and thaw: it was a miracle to scape suffocation.</LINE>
<LINE>And in the height of this bath, when I was more than</LINE>
<LINE>half stewed in grease, like a Dutch dish, to be</LINE>
<LINE>thrown into the Thames, and cooled, glowing hot,</LINE>
<LINE>in that surge, like a horse-shoe; think of</LINE>
<LINE>that,--hissing hot,--think of that, Master Brook.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In good sadness, I am sorry that for my sake you</LINE>
<LINE>have sufferd all this. My suit then is desperate;</LINE>
<LINE>you'll undertake her no more?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Master Brook, I will be thrown into Etna, as I have</LINE>
<LINE>been into Thames, ere I will leave her thus. Her</LINE>
<LINE>husband is this morning gone a-birding: I have</LINE>
<LINE>received from her another embassy of meeting; 'twixt</LINE>
<LINE>eight and nine is the hour, Master Brook.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis past eight already, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is it? I will then address me to my appointment.</LINE>
<LINE>Come to me at your convenient leisure, and you shall</LINE>
<LINE>know how I speed; and the conclusion shall be</LINE>
<LINE>crowned with your enjoying her. Adieu. You shall</LINE>
<LINE>have her, Master Brook; Master Brook, you shall</LINE>
<LINE>cuckold Ford.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hum! ha! is this a vision? is this a dream? do I</LINE>
<LINE>sleep? Master Ford awake! awake, Master Ford!</LINE>
<LINE>there's a hole made in your best coat, Master Ford.</LINE>
<LINE>This 'tis to be married! this 'tis to have linen</LINE>
<LINE>and buck-baskets! Well, I will proclaim myself</LINE>
<LINE>what I am: I will now take the lecher; he is at my</LINE>
<LINE>house; he cannot 'scape me; 'tis impossible he</LINE>
<LINE>should; he cannot creep into a halfpenny purse,</LINE>
<LINE>nor into a pepper-box: but, lest the devil that</LINE>
<LINE>guides him should aid him, I will search</LINE>
<LINE>impossible places. Though what I am I cannot avoid,</LINE>
<LINE>yet to be what I would not shall not make me tame:</LINE>
<LINE>if I have horns to make one mad, let the proverb go</LINE>
<LINE>with me: I'll be horn-mad.</LINE>

<LINE>Why, woman, your husband is in his old lunes again:</LINE>
<LINE>he so takes on yonder with my husband; so rails</LINE>
<LINE>against all married mankind; so curses all Eve's</LINE>
<LINE>daughters, of what complexion soever; and so buffets</LINE>
<LINE>himself on the forehead, crying, 'Peer out, peer</LINE>
<LINE>out!' that any madness I ever yet beheld seemed but</LINE>

<LINE>He will seek there, on my word. Neither press,</LINE>

<LINE>brought to pass under the profession of</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS PAGE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The spirit of wantonness is, sure, scared out of</LINE>

<LINE>'Tis one of the best discretions of a 'oman as ever</LINE>
<LINE>I did look upon.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAGE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And did he send you both these letters at an instant?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS PAGE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Within a quarter of an hour.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pardon me, wife. Henceforth do what thou wilt;</LINE>
<LINE>I rather will suspect the sun with cold</LINE>
<LINE>Than thee with wantonness: now doth thy honour stand</LINE>
<LINE>In him that was of late an heretic,</LINE>
<LINE>As firm as faith.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAGE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis well, 'tis well; no more:</LINE>
<LINE>Be not as extreme in submission</LINE>
<LINE>As in offence.</LINE>
<LINE>But let our plot go forward: let our wives</LINE>

<LINE>Appoint a meeting with this old fat fellow,</LINE>

<LINE>How? to send him word they'll meet him in the park</LINE>
<LINE>at midnight? Fie, fie! he'll never come.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR HUGH EVANS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You say he has been thrown in the rivers and has</LINE>
<LINE>been grievously peaten as an old 'oman: methinks</LINE>
<LINE>there should be terrors in him that he should not</LINE>
<LINE>come; methinks his flesh is punished, he shall have</LINE>
<LINE>no desires.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAGE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So think I too.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Devise but how you'll use him when he comes,</LINE>
<LINE>And let us two devise to bring him thither.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS PAGE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There is an old tale goes that Herne the hunter,</LINE>
<LINE>Sometime a keeper here in Windsor forest,</LINE>
<LINE>Doth all the winter-time, at still midnight,</LINE>
<LINE>Walk round about an oak, with great ragg'd horns;</LINE>
<LINE>And there he blasts the tree and takes the cattle</LINE>
<LINE>And makes milch-kine yield blood and shakes a chain</LINE>
<LINE>In a most hideous and dreadful manner:</LINE>
<LINE>You have heard of such a spirit, and well you know</LINE>
<LINE>The superstitious idle-headed eld</LINE>
<LINE>Received and did deliver to our age</LINE>
<LINE>This tale of Herne the hunter for a truth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAGE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, yet there want not many that do fear</LINE>
<LINE>In deep of night to walk by this Herne's oak:</LINE>
<LINE>But what of this?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, this is our device;</LINE>
<LINE>That Falstaff at that oak shall meet with us.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAGE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, let it not be doubted but he'll come:</LINE>
<LINE>And in this shape when you have brought him thither,</LINE>
<LINE>What shall be done with him? what is your plot?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS PAGE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That likewise have we thought upon, and thus:</LINE>
<LINE>Nan Page my daughter and my little son</LINE>
<LINE>And three or four more of their growth we'll dress</LINE>
<LINE>Like urchins, ouphes and fairies, green and white,</LINE>
<LINE>With rounds of waxen tapers on their heads,</LINE>
<LINE>And rattles in their hands: upon a sudden,</LINE>
<LINE>As Falstaff, she and I, are newly met,</LINE>
<LINE>Let them from forth a sawpit rush at once</LINE>
<LINE>With some diffused song: upon their sight,</LINE>
<LINE>We two in great amazedness will fly:</LINE>
<LINE>Then let them all encircle him about</LINE>
<LINE>And, fairy-like, to-pinch the unclean knight,</LINE>
<LINE>And ask him why, that hour of fairy revel,</LINE>
<LINE>In their so sacred paths he dares to tread</LINE>
<LINE>In shape profane.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And till he tell the truth,</LINE>
<LINE>Let the supposed fairies pinch him sound</LINE>
<LINE>And burn him with their tapers.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS PAGE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The truth being known,</LINE>
<LINE>We'll all present ourselves, dis-horn the spirit,</LINE>
<LINE>And mock him home to Windsor.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The children must</LINE>
<LINE>Be practised well to this, or they'll ne'er do't.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR HUGH EVANS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will teach the children their behaviors; and I</LINE>
<LINE>will be like a jack-an-apes also, to burn the</LINE>
<LINE>knight with my taber.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That will be excellent. I'll go and buy them vizards.</LINE>

<LINE>That silk will I go buy.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay I'll to him again in name of Brook</LINE>

<LINE>and how my transformation hath been washed and</LINE>
<LINE>cudgelled, they would melt me out of my fat drop by</LINE>
<LINE>drop and liquor fishermen's boots with me; I warrant</LINE>
<LINE>they would whip me with their fine wits till I were</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS QUICKLY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And have not they suffered? Yes, I warrant;</LINE>
<LINE>speciously one of them; Mistress Ford, good heart,</LINE>

<LINE>white spot about her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What tellest thou me of black and blue? I was</LINE>
<LINE>beaten myself into all the colours of the rainbow;</LINE>
<LINE>and I was like to be apprehended for the witch of</LINE>
<LINE>Brentford: but that my admirable dexterity of wit,</LINE>
<LINE>my counterfeiting the action of an old woman,</LINE>

<LINE>That neither singly can be manifested,</LINE>
<LINE>Without the show of both; fat Falstaff</LINE>
<LINE>Hath a great scene: the image of the jest</LINE>
<LINE>I'll show you here at large. Hark, good mine host.</LINE>
<LINE>To-night at Herne's oak, just 'twixt twelve and one,</LINE>
<LINE>Must my sweet Nan present the Fairy Queen;</LINE>
<LINE>The purpose why, is here: in which disguise,</LINE>
<LINE>While other jests are something rank on foot,</LINE>
<LINE>Her father hath commanded her to slip</LINE>
<LINE>Away with Slender and with him at Eton</LINE>
<LINE>Immediately to marry: she hath consented: Now, sir,</LINE>
<LINE>Her mother, ever strong against that match</LINE>
<LINE>And firm for Doctor Caius, hath appointed</LINE>
<LINE>That he shall likewise shuffle her away,</LINE>
<LINE>While other sports are tasking of their minds,</LINE>
<LINE>And at the deanery, where a priest attends,</LINE>
<LINE>Straight marry her: to this her mother's plot</LINE>
<LINE>She seemingly obedient likewise hath</LINE>
<LINE>Made promise to the doctor. Now, thus it rests:</LINE>
<LINE>Her father means she shall be all in white,</LINE>
<LINE>And in that habit, when Slender sees his time</LINE>
<LINE>To take her by the hand and bid her go,</LINE>
<LINE>She shall go with him: her mother hath intended,</LINE>
<LINE>The better to denote her to the doctor,</LINE>
<LINE>For they must all be mask'd and vizarded,</LINE>
<LINE>That quaint in green she shall be loose enrobed,</LINE>
<LINE>With ribands pendent, flaring 'bout her head;</LINE>
<LINE>And when the doctor spies his vantage ripe,</LINE>
<LINE>To pinch her by the hand, and, on that token,</LINE>
<LINE>The maid hath given consent to go with him.</LINE>

<LINE>Master Brook, that ever governed frenzy. I will tell</LINE>
<LINE>you: he beat me grievously, in the shape of a</LINE>

<SPEAKER>MISTRESS QUICKLY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With trial-fire touch me his finger-end:</LINE>
<LINE>If he be chaste, the flame will back descend</LINE>
<LINE>And turn him to no pain; but if he start,</LINE>
<LINE>It is the flesh of a corrupted heart.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PISTOL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A trial, come.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR HUGH EVANS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, will this wood take fire?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>They burn him with their tapers</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Oh, Oh, Oh!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS QUICKLY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Corrupt, corrupt, and tainted in desire!</LINE>
<LINE>About him, fairies; sing a scornful rhyme;</LINE>
<LINE>And, as you trip, still pinch him to your time.</LINE>
<SUBHEAD>SONG.</SUBHEAD>
<LINE>Fie on sinful fantasy!</LINE>
<LINE>Fie on lust and luxury!</LINE>
<LINE>Lust is but a bloody fire,</LINE>
<LINE>Kindled with unchaste desire,</LINE>
<LINE>Fed in heart, whose flames aspire</LINE>
<LINE>As thoughts do blow them, higher and higher.</LINE>
<LINE>Pinch him, fairies, mutually;</LINE>
<LINE>Pinch him for his villany;</LINE>
<LINE>Pinch him, and burn him, and turn him about,</LINE>
<LINE>Till candles and starlight and moonshine be out.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>During this song they pinch FALSTAFF. DOCTOR CAIUS
comes one way, and steals away a boy in green;
SLENDER another way, and takes off a boy in white;
and FENTON comes and steals away ANN PAGE.
A noise of hunting is heard within. All the
Fairies run away. FALSTAFF pulls off his buck's
head, and rises</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>Enter PAGE, FORD, MISTRESS PAGE, and MISTRESS FORD</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAGE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, do not fly; I think we have watch'd you now</LINE>
<LINE>Will none but Herne the hunter serve your turn?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS PAGE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I pray you, come, hold up the jest no higher</LINE>
<LINE>Now, good Sir John, how like you Windsor wives?</LINE>
<LINE>See you these, husband? do not these fair yokes</LINE>
<LINE>Become the forest better than the town?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, sir, who's a cuckold now? Master Brook,</LINE>
<LINE>Falstaff's a knave, a cuckoldly knave; here are his</LINE>
<LINE>horns, Master Brook: and, Master Brook, he hath</LINE>
<LINE>enjoyed nothing of Ford's but his buck-basket, his</LINE>
<LINE>cudgel, and twenty pounds of money, which must be</LINE>
<LINE>paid to Master Brook; his horses are arrested for</LINE>
<LINE>it, Master Brook.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir John, we have had ill luck; we could never meet.</LINE>
<LINE>I will never take you for my love again; but I will</LINE>
<LINE>always count you my deer.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do begin to perceive that I am made an ass.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, and an ox too: both the proofs are extant.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And these are not fairies? I was three or four</LINE>
<LINE>times in the thought they were not fairies: and yet</LINE>
<LINE>the guiltiness of my mind, the sudden surprise of my</LINE>
<LINE>powers, drove the grossness of the foppery into a</LINE>
<LINE>received belief, in despite of the teeth of all</LINE>
<LINE>rhyme and reason, that they were fairies. See now</LINE>
<LINE>how wit may be made a Jack-a-Lent, when 'tis upon</LINE>
<LINE>ill employment!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR HUGH EVANS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir John Falstaff, serve Got, and leave your</LINE>
<LINE>desires, and fairies will not pinse you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well said, fairy Hugh.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR HUGH EVANS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And leave your jealousies too, I pray you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will never mistrust my wife again till thou art</LINE>
<LINE>able to woo her in good English.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Have I laid my brain in the sun and dried it, that</LINE>
<LINE>it wants matter to prevent so gross o'erreaching as</LINE>
<LINE>this? Am I ridden with a Welsh goat too? shall I</LINE>
<LINE>have a coxcomb of frize? 'Tis time I were choked</LINE>
<LINE>with a piece of toasted cheese.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR HUGH EVANS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Seese is not good to give putter; your belly is all putter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Seese' and 'putter'! have I lived to stand at the</LINE>
<LINE>taunt of one that makes fritters of English? This</LINE>
<LINE>is enough to be the decay of lust and late-walking</LINE>
<LINE>through the realm.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS PAGE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why Sir John, do you think, though we would have the</LINE>
<LINE>virtue out of our hearts by the head and shoulders</LINE>
<LINE>and have given ourselves without scruple to hell,</LINE>
<LINE>that ever the devil could have made you our delight?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEAKER>FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, a hodge-pudding? a bag of flax?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS PAGE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A puffed man?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAGE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Old, cold, withered and of intolerable entrails?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And one that is as slanderous as Satan?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAGE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And as poor as Job?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And as wicked as his wife?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR HUGH EVANS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And given to fornications, and to taverns and sack</LINE>
<LINE>and wine and metheglins, and to drinkings and</LINE>
<LINE>swearings and starings, pribbles and prabbles?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, I am your theme: you have the start of me; I</LINE>
<LINE>am dejected; I am not able to answer the Welsh</LINE>
<LINE>flannel; ignorance itself is a plummet o'er me: use</LINE>
<LINE>me as you will.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, sir, we'll bring you to Windsor, to one</LINE>
<LINE>Master Brook, that you have cozened of money, to</LINE>
<LINE>whom you should have been a pander: over and above</LINE>
<LINE>that you have suffered, I think to repay that money</LINE>
<LINE>will be a biting affliction.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAGE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yet be cheerful, knight: thou shalt eat a posset</LINE>
<LINE>to-night at my house; where I will desire thee to</LINE>
<LINE>laugh at my wife, that now laughs at thee: tell her</LINE>
<LINE>Master Slender hath married her daughter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS PAGE</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  Doctors doubt that: if Anne Page be my</LINE>
<LINE>daughter, she is, by this, Doctor Caius' wife.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter SLENDER</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SLENDER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Whoa ho! ho, father Page!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAGE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Son, how now! how now, son! have you dispatched?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SLENDER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Dispatched! I'll make the best in Gloucestershire</LINE>
<LINE>know on't; would I were hanged, la, else.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAGE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Of what, son?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SLENDER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I came yonder at Eton to marry Mistress Anne Page,</LINE>
<LINE>and she's a great lubberly boy. If it had not been</LINE>
<LINE>i' the church, I would have swinged him, or he</LINE>
<LINE>should have swinged me. If I did not think it had</LINE>
<LINE>been Anne Page, would I might never stir!--and 'tis</LINE>
<LINE>a postmaster's boy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAGE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Upon my life, then, you took the wrong.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SLENDER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What need you tell me that? I think so, when I took</LINE>
<LINE>a boy for a girl. If I had been married to him, for</LINE>
<LINE>all he was in woman's apparel, I would not have had</LINE>
<LINE>him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAGE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, this is your own folly. Did not I tell you how</LINE>
<LINE>you should know my daughter by her garments?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SLENDER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I went to her in white, and cried 'mum,' and she</LINE>
<LINE>cried 'budget,' as Anne and I had appointed; and yet</LINE>
<LINE>it was not Anne, but a postmaster's boy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS PAGE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good George, be not angry: I knew of your purpose;</LINE>
<LINE>turned my daughter into green; and, indeed, she is</LINE>
<LINE>now with the doctor at the deanery, and there married.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter DOCTOR CAIUS</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOCTOR CAIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Vere is Mistress Page? By gar, I am cozened: I ha'</LINE>
<LINE>married un garcon, a boy; un paysan, by gar, a boy;</LINE>
<LINE>it is not Anne Page: by gar, I am cozened.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS PAGE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, did you take her in green?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOCTOR CAIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, by gar, and 'tis a boy: by gar, I'll raise all Windsor.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is strange. Who hath got the right Anne?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAGE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My heart misgives me: here comes Master Fenton.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter FENTON and ANNE PAGE</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>How now, Master Fenton!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANNE PAGE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pardon, good father! good my mother, pardon!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAGE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, mistress, how chance you went not with Master Slender?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS PAGE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why went you not with master doctor, maid?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FENTON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You do amaze her: hear the truth of it.</LINE>
<LINE>You would have married her most shamefully,</LINE>
<LINE>Where there was no proportion held in love.</LINE>
<LINE>The truth is, she and I, long since contracted,</LINE>
<LINE>Are now so sure that nothing can dissolve us.</LINE>
<LINE>The offence is holy that she hath committed;</LINE>
<LINE>And this deceit loses the name of craft,</LINE>
<LINE>Of disobedience, or unduteous title,</LINE>
<LINE>Since therein she doth evitate and shun</LINE>
<LINE>A thousand irreligious cursed hours,</LINE>
<LINE>Which forced marriage would have brought upon her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Stand not amazed; here is no remedy:</LINE>
<LINE>In love the heavens themselves do guide the state;</LINE>
<LINE>Money buys lands, and wives are sold by fate.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am glad, though you have ta'en a special stand to</LINE>
<LINE>strike at me, that your arrow hath glanced.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAGE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, what remedy? Fenton, heaven give thee joy!</LINE>
<LINE>What cannot be eschew'd must be embraced.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FALSTAFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>When night-dogs run, all sorts of deer are chased.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MISTRESS PAGE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, I will muse no further. Master Fenton,</LINE>
<LINE>Heaven give you many, many merry days!</LINE>
<LINE>Good husband, let us every one go home,</LINE>
<LINE>And laugh this sport o'er by a country fire;</LINE>
<LINE>Sir John and all.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let it be so. Sir John,</LINE>
<LINE>To Master Brook you yet shall hold your word</LINE>
<LINE>For he tonight shall lie with Mistress Ford.</LINE>
