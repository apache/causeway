<STAGEDIR>Enter GLOUCESTER, solus</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now is the winter of our discontent</LINE>
<LINE>Made glorious summer by this sun of York;</LINE>
<LINE>And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house</LINE>
<LINE>In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.</LINE>
<LINE>Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;</LINE>
<LINE>Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;</LINE>
<LINE>Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,</LINE>
<LINE>Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.</LINE>
<LINE>Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;</LINE>
<LINE>And now, instead of mounting barded steeds</LINE>
<LINE>To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,</LINE>
<LINE>He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber</LINE>
<LINE>To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.</LINE>
<LINE>But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;</LINE>
<LINE>I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty</LINE>
<LINE>To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;</LINE>
<LINE>I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,</LINE>
<LINE>Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,</LINE>
<LINE>Deformed, unfinish'd, sent before my time</LINE>
<LINE>Into this breathing world, scarce half made up,</LINE>
<LINE>And that so lamely and unfashionable</LINE>
<LINE>That dogs bark at me as I halt by them;</LINE>
<LINE>Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,</LINE>
<LINE>Have no delight to pass away the time,</LINE>
<LINE>Unless to spy my shadow in the sun</LINE>
<LINE>And descant on mine own deformity:</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover,</LINE>
<LINE>To entertain these fair well-spoken days,</LINE>
<LINE>I am determined to prove a villain</LINE>
<LINE>And hate the idle pleasures of these days.</LINE>
<LINE>Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,</LINE>
<LINE>By drunken prophecies, libels and dreams,</LINE>
<LINE>To set my brother Clarence and the king</LINE>
<LINE>In deadly hate the one against the other:</LINE>
<LINE>And if King Edward be as true and just</LINE>
<LINE>As I am subtle, false and treacherous,</LINE>
<LINE>This day should Clarence closely be mew'd up,</LINE>
<LINE>About a prophecy, which says that 'G'</LINE>
<LINE>Of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be.</LINE>
<LINE>Dive, thoughts, down to my soul: here</LINE>
<LINE>Clarence comes.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter CLARENCE, guarded, and BRAKENBURY</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Brother, good day; what means this armed guard</LINE>
<LINE>That waits upon your grace?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLARENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>His majesty</LINE>
<LINE>Tendering my person's safety, hath appointed</LINE>
<LINE>This conduct to convey me to the Tower.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Upon what cause?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLARENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Because my name is George.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours;</LINE>
<LINE>He should, for that, commit your godfathers:</LINE>
<LINE>O, belike his majesty hath some intent</LINE>
<LINE>That you shall be new-christen'd in the Tower.</LINE>
<LINE>But what's the matter, Clarence?  may I know?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLARENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yea, Richard, when I know; for I protest</LINE>
<LINE>As yet I do not: but, as I can learn,</LINE>
<LINE>He hearkens after prophecies and dreams;</LINE>
<LINE>And from the cross-row plucks the letter G.</LINE>
<LINE>And says a wizard told him that by G</LINE>
<LINE>His issue disinherited should be;</LINE>
<LINE>And, for my name of George begins with G,</LINE>
<LINE>It follows in his thought that I am he.</LINE>
<LINE>These, as I learn, and such like toys as these</LINE>
<LINE>Have moved his highness to commit me now.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, this it is, when men are ruled by women:</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis not the king that sends you to the Tower:</LINE>
<LINE>My Lady Grey his wife, Clarence, 'tis she</LINE>
<LINE>That tempers him to this extremity.</LINE>
<LINE>Was it not she and that good man of worship,</LINE>
<LINE>Anthony Woodville, her brother there,</LINE>
<LINE>That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower,</LINE>
<LINE>From whence this present day he is deliver'd?</LINE>
<LINE>We are not safe, Clarence; we are not safe.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLARENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By heaven, I think there's no man is secure</LINE>
<LINE>But the queen's kindred and night-walking heralds</LINE>
<LINE>That trudge betwixt the king and Mistress Shore.</LINE>
<LINE>Heard ye not what an humble suppliant</LINE>
<LINE>Lord hastings was to her for his delivery?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Humbly complaining to her deity</LINE>
<LINE>Got my lord chamberlain his liberty.</LINE>
<LINE>I'll tell you what; I think it is our way,</LINE>
<LINE>If we will keep in favour with the king,</LINE>
<LINE>To be her men and wear her livery:</LINE>
<LINE>The jealous o'erworn widow and herself,</LINE>
<LINE>Since that our brother dubb'd them gentlewomen.</LINE>
<LINE>Are mighty gossips in this monarchy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRAKENBURY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I beseech your graces both to pardon me;</LINE>
<LINE>His majesty hath straitly given in charge</LINE>
<LINE>That no man shall have private conference,</LINE>
<LINE>Of what degree soever, with his brother.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Even so; an't please your worship, Brakenbury,</LINE>
<LINE>You may partake of any thing we say:</LINE>
<LINE>We speak no treason, man: we say the king</LINE>
<LINE>Is wise and virtuous, and his noble queen</LINE>
<LINE>Well struck in years, fair, and not jealous;</LINE>
<LINE>We say that Shore's wife hath a pretty foot,</LINE>
<LINE>A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue;</LINE>
<LINE>And that the queen's kindred are made gentle-folks:</LINE>
<LINE>How say you sir? Can you deny all this?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRAKENBURY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With this, my lord, myself have nought to do.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Naught to do with mistress Shore! I tell thee, fellow,</LINE>
<LINE>He that doth naught with her, excepting one,</LINE>
<LINE>Were best he do it secretly, alone.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRAKENBURY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What one, my lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Her husband, knave: wouldst thou betray me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRAKENBURY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I beseech your grace to pardon me, and withal</LINE>
<LINE>Forbear your conference with the noble duke.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLARENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will obey.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We are the queen's abjects, and must obey.</LINE>
<LINE>Brother, farewell: I will unto the king;</LINE>
<LINE>And whatsoever you will employ me in,</LINE>
<LINE>Were it to call King Edward's widow sister,</LINE>
<LINE>I will perform it to enfranchise you.</LINE>
<LINE>Meantime, this deep disgrace in brotherhood</LINE>
<LINE>Touches me deeper than you can imagine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLARENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know it pleaseth neither of us well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, your imprisonment shall not be long;</LINE>
<LINE>Meantime, have patience.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLARENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I must perforce. Farewell.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt CLARENCE, BRAKENBURY, and Guard</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go, tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return.</LINE>
<LINE>Simple, plain Clarence! I do love thee so,</LINE>
<LINE>That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven,</LINE>
<LINE>If heaven will take the present at our hands.</LINE>
<LINE>But who comes here? the new-deliver'd Hastings?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter HASTINGS</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good time of day unto my gracious lord!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As much unto my good lord chamberlain!</LINE>
<LINE>Well are you welcome to the open air.</LINE>
<LINE>How hath your lordship brook'd imprisonment?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With patience, noble lord, as prisoners must:</LINE>
<LINE>But I shall live, my lord, to give them thanks</LINE>
<LINE>That were the cause of my imprisonment.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No doubt, no doubt; and so shall Clarence too;</LINE>
<LINE>For they that were your enemies are his,</LINE>
<LINE>And have prevail'd as much on him as you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>More pity that the eagle should be mew'd,</LINE>
<LINE>While kites and buzzards prey at liberty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What news abroad?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No news so bad abroad as this at home;</LINE>
<LINE>The King is sickly, weak and melancholy,</LINE>
<LINE>And his physicians fear him mightily.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, by Saint Paul, this news is bad indeed.</LINE>
<LINE>O, he hath kept an evil diet long,</LINE>
<LINE>And overmuch consumed his royal person:</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis very grievous to be thought upon.</LINE>
<LINE>What, is he in his bed?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He is.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go you before, and I will follow you.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit HASTINGS</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>He cannot live, I hope; and must not die</LINE>
<LINE>Till George be pack'd with post-horse up to heaven.</LINE>
<LINE>I'll in, to urge his hatred more to Clarence,</LINE>
<LINE>With lies well steel'd with weighty arguments;</LINE>
<LINE>And, if I fall not in my deep intent,</LINE>
<LINE>Clarence hath not another day to live:</LINE>
<LINE>Which done, God take King Edward to his mercy,</LINE>
<LINE>And leave the world for me to bustle in!</LINE>
<LINE>For then I'll marry Warwick's youngest daughter.</LINE>
<LINE>What though I kill'd her husband and her father?</LINE>
<LINE>The readiest way to make the wench amends</LINE>
<LINE>Is to become her husband and her father:</LINE>
<LINE>The which will I; not all so much for love</LINE>
<LINE>As for another secret close intent,</LINE>
<LINE>By marrying her which I must reach unto.</LINE>
<LINE>But yet I run before my horse to market:</LINE>
<LINE>Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns:</LINE>
<LINE>When they are gone, then must I count my gains.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>
</SCENE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE II.  The same. Another street.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter the corpse of KING HENRY the Sixth, Gentlemen
with halberds to guard it; LADY ANNE being the mourner</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY ANNE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Set down, set down your honourable load,</LINE>
<LINE>If honour may be shrouded in a hearse,</LINE>
<LINE>Whilst I awhile obsequiously lament</LINE>
<LINE>The untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster.</LINE>
<LINE>Poor key-cold figure of a holy king!</LINE>
<LINE>Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster!</LINE>
<LINE>Thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood!</LINE>
<LINE>Be it lawful that I invocate thy ghost,</LINE>
<LINE>To hear the lamentations of Poor Anne,</LINE>
<LINE>Wife to thy Edward, to thy slaughter'd son,</LINE>
<LINE>Stabb'd by the selfsame hand that made these wounds!</LINE>
<LINE>Lo, in these windows that let forth thy life,</LINE>
<LINE>I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes.</LINE>
<LINE>Cursed be the hand that made these fatal holes!</LINE>
<LINE>Cursed be the heart that had the heart to do it!</LINE>
<LINE>Cursed the blood that let this blood from hence!</LINE>
<LINE>More direful hap betide that hated wretch,</LINE>
<LINE>That makes us wretched by the death of thee,</LINE>
<LINE>Than I can wish to adders, spiders, toads,</LINE>
<LINE>Or any creeping venom'd thing that lives!</LINE>
<LINE>If ever he have child, abortive be it,</LINE>
<LINE>Prodigious, and untimely brought to light,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose ugly and unnatural aspect</LINE>
<LINE>May fright the hopeful mother at the view;</LINE>
<LINE>And that be heir to his unhappiness!</LINE>
<LINE>If ever he have wife, let her he made</LINE>
<LINE>A miserable by the death of him</LINE>
<LINE>As I am made by my poor lord and thee!</LINE>
<LINE>Come, now towards Chertsey with your holy load,</LINE>
<LINE>Taken from Paul's to be interred there;</LINE>
<LINE>And still, as you are weary of the weight,</LINE>
<LINE>Rest you, whiles I lament King Henry's corse.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter GLOUCESTER</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Stay, you that bear the corse, and set it down.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY ANNE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What black magician conjures up this fiend,</LINE>
<LINE>To stop devoted charitable deeds?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul,</LINE>
<LINE>I'll make a corse of him that disobeys.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Gentleman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, stand back, and let the coffin pass.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Unmanner'd dog! stand thou, when I command:</LINE>
<LINE>Advance thy halbert higher than my breast,</LINE>
<LINE>Or, by Saint Paul, I'll strike thee to my foot,</LINE>
<LINE>And spurn upon thee, beggar, for thy boldness.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY ANNE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, do you tremble? are you all afraid?</LINE>
<LINE>Alas, I blame you not; for you are mortal,</LINE>
<LINE>And mortal eyes cannot endure the devil.</LINE>
<LINE>Avaunt, thou dreadful minister of hell!</LINE>
<LINE>Thou hadst but power over his mortal body,</LINE>
<LINE>His soul thou canst not have; therefore be gone.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sweet saint, for charity, be not so curst.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY ANNE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Foul devil, for God's sake, hence, and trouble us not;</LINE>
<LINE>For thou hast made the happy earth thy hell,</LINE>
<LINE>Fill'd it with cursing cries and deep exclaims.</LINE>
<LINE>If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds,</LINE>
<LINE>Behold this pattern of thy butcheries.</LINE>
<LINE>O, gentlemen, see, see! dead Henry's wounds</LINE>
<LINE>Open their congeal'd mouths and bleed afresh!</LINE>
<LINE>Blush, Blush, thou lump of foul deformity;</LINE>
<LINE>For 'tis thy presence that exhales this blood</LINE>
<LINE>From cold and empty veins, where no blood dwells;</LINE>
<LINE>Thy deed, inhuman and unnatural,</LINE>
<LINE>Provokes this deluge most unnatural.</LINE>
<LINE>O God, which this blood madest, revenge his death!</LINE>
<LINE>O earth, which this blood drink'st revenge his death!</LINE>
<LINE>Either heaven with lightning strike the</LINE>
<LINE>murderer dead,</LINE>
<LINE>Or earth, gape open wide and eat him quick,</LINE>
<LINE>As thou dost swallow up this good king's blood</LINE>
<LINE>Which his hell-govern'd arm hath butchered!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lady, you know no rules of charity,</LINE>
<LINE>Which renders good for bad, blessings for curses.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY ANNE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Villain, thou know'st no law of God nor man:</LINE>
<LINE>No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But I know none, and therefore am no beast.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY ANNE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O wonderful, when devils tell the truth!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>More wonderful, when angels are so angry.</LINE>
<LINE>Vouchsafe, divine perfection of a woman,</LINE>
<LINE>Of these supposed-evils, to give me leave,</LINE>
<LINE>By circumstance, but to acquit myself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY ANNE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Vouchsafe, defused infection of a man,</LINE>
<LINE>For these known evils, but to give me leave,</LINE>
<LINE>By circumstance, to curse thy cursed self.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have</LINE>
<LINE>Some patient leisure to excuse myself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY ANNE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fouler than heart can think thee, thou canst make</LINE>
<LINE>No excuse current, but to hang thyself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By such despair, I should accuse myself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY ANNE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And, by despairing, shouldst thou stand excused;</LINE>
<LINE>For doing worthy vengeance on thyself,</LINE>
<LINE>Which didst unworthy slaughter upon others.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Say that I slew them not?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY ANNE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, then they are not dead:</LINE>
<LINE>But dead they are, and devilish slave, by thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I did not kill your husband.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY ANNE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, then he is alive.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, he is dead; and slain by Edward's hand.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY ANNE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In thy foul throat thou liest: Queen Margaret saw</LINE>
<LINE>Thy murderous falchion smoking in his blood;</LINE>
<LINE>The which thou once didst bend against her breast,</LINE>
<LINE>But that thy brothers beat aside the point.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I was provoked by her slanderous tongue,</LINE>
<LINE>which laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY ANNE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind.</LINE>
<LINE>Which never dreamt on aught but butcheries:</LINE>
<LINE>Didst thou not kill this king?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I grant ye.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY ANNE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Dost grant me, hedgehog? then, God grant me too</LINE>
<LINE>Thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed!</LINE>
<LINE>O, he was gentle, mild, and virtuous!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The fitter for the King of heaven, that hath him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY ANNE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He is in heaven, where thou shalt never come.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let him thank me, that holp to send him thither;</LINE>
<LINE>For he was fitter for that place than earth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY ANNE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And thou unfit for any place but hell.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, one place else, if you will hear me name it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY ANNE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Some dungeon.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your bed-chamber.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY ANNE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll rest betide the chamber where thou liest!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So will it, madam till I lie with you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY ANNE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I hope so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know so. But, gentle Lady Anne,</LINE>
<LINE>To leave this keen encounter of our wits,</LINE>
<LINE>And fall somewhat into a slower method,</LINE>
<LINE>Is not the causer of the timeless deaths</LINE>
<LINE>Of these Plantagenets, Henry and Edward,</LINE>
<LINE>As blameful as the executioner?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY ANNE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou art the cause, and most accursed effect.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your beauty was the cause of that effect;</LINE>
<LINE>Your beauty: which did haunt me in my sleep</LINE>
<LINE>To undertake the death of all the world,</LINE>
<LINE>So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY ANNE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If I thought that, I tell thee, homicide,</LINE>
<LINE>These nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>These eyes could never endure sweet beauty's wreck;</LINE>
<LINE>You should not blemish it, if I stood by:</LINE>
<LINE>As all the world is cheered by the sun,</LINE>
<LINE>So I by that; it is my day, my life.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY ANNE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Black night o'ershade thy day, and death thy life!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Curse not thyself, fair creature thou art both.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY ANNE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would I were, to be revenged on thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is a quarrel most unnatural,</LINE>
<LINE>To be revenged on him that loveth you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY ANNE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is a quarrel just and reasonable,</LINE>
<LINE>To be revenged on him that slew my husband.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He that bereft thee, lady, of thy husband,</LINE>
<LINE>Did it to help thee to a better husband.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY ANNE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>His better doth not breathe upon the earth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He lives that loves thee better than he could.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY ANNE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Name him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Plantagenet.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY ANNE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, that was he.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The selfsame name, but one of better nature.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY ANNE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where is he?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>She spitteth at him</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Why dost thou spit at me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY ANNE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Would it were mortal poison, for thy sake!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Never came poison from so sweet a place.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY ANNE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Never hung poison on a fouler toad.</LINE>
<LINE>Out of my sight! thou dost infect my eyes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thine eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY ANNE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Would they were basilisks, to strike thee dead!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would they were, that I might die at once;</LINE>
<LINE>For now they kill me with a living death.</LINE>
<LINE>Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears,</LINE>
<LINE>Shamed their aspect with store of childish drops:</LINE>
<LINE>These eyes that never shed remorseful tear,</LINE>
<LINE>No, when my father York and Edward wept,</LINE>
<LINE>To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made</LINE>
<LINE>When black-faced Clifford shook his sword at him;</LINE>
<LINE>Nor when thy warlike father, like a child,</LINE>
<LINE>Told the sad story of my father's death,</LINE>
<LINE>And twenty times made pause to sob and weep,</LINE>
<LINE>That all the standers-by had wet their cheeks</LINE>
<LINE>Like trees bedash'd with rain: in that sad time</LINE>
<LINE>My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear;</LINE>
<LINE>And what these sorrows could not thence exhale,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy beauty hath, and made them blind with weeping.</LINE>
<LINE>I never sued to friend nor enemy;</LINE>
<LINE>My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word;</LINE>
<LINE>But now thy beauty is proposed my fee,</LINE>
<LINE>My proud heart sues, and prompts my tongue to speak.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>She looks scornfully at him</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Teach not thy lips such scorn, for they were made</LINE>
<LINE>For kissing, lady, not for such contempt.</LINE>
<LINE>If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive,</LINE>
<LINE>Lo, here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword;</LINE>
<LINE>Which if thou please to hide in this true bosom.</LINE>
<LINE>And let the soul forth that adoreth thee,</LINE>
<LINE>I lay it naked to the deadly stroke,</LINE>
<LINE>And humbly beg the death upon my knee.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>He lays his breast open: she offers at it with his sword</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Nay, do not pause; for I did kill King Henry,</LINE>
<LINE>But 'twas thy beauty that provoked me.</LINE>
<LINE>Nay, now dispatch; 'twas I that stabb'd young Edward,</LINE>
<LINE>But 'twas thy heavenly face that set me on.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Here she lets fall the sword</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Take up the sword again, or take up me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY ANNE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Arise, dissembler: though I wish thy death,</LINE>
<LINE>I will not be the executioner.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then bid me kill myself, and I will do it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY ANNE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have already.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tush, that was in thy rage:</LINE>
<LINE>Speak it again, and, even with the word,</LINE>
<LINE>That hand, which, for thy love, did kill thy love,</LINE>
<LINE>Shall, for thy love, kill a far truer love;</LINE>
<LINE>To both their deaths thou shalt be accessary.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY ANNE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would I knew thy heart.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis figured in my tongue.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY ANNE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I fear me both are false.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then never man was true.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY ANNE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, well, put up your sword.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Say, then, my peace is made.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY ANNE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That shall you know hereafter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But shall I live in hope?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY ANNE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>All men, I hope, live so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Vouchsafe to wear this ring.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY ANNE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To take is not to give.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Look, how this ring encompasseth finger.</LINE>
<LINE>Even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart;</LINE>
<LINE>Wear both of them, for both of them are thine.</LINE>
<LINE>And if thy poor devoted suppliant may</LINE>
<LINE>But beg one favour at thy gracious hand,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou dost confirm his happiness for ever.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY ANNE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What is it?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That it would please thee leave these sad designs</LINE>
<LINE>To him that hath more cause to be a mourner,</LINE>
<LINE>And presently repair to Crosby Place;</LINE>
<LINE>Where, after I have solemnly interr'd</LINE>
<LINE>At Chertsey monastery this noble king,</LINE>
<LINE>And wet his grave with my repentant tears,</LINE>
<LINE>I will with all expedient duty see you:</LINE>
<LINE>For divers unknown reasons. I beseech you,</LINE>
<LINE>Grant me this boon.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY ANNE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With all my heart; and much it joys me too,</LINE>
<LINE>To see you are become so penitent.</LINE>
<LINE>Tressel and Berkeley, go along with me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Bid me farewell.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY ANNE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis more than you deserve;</LINE>
<LINE>But since you teach me how to flatter you,</LINE>
<LINE>Imagine I have said farewell already.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt LADY ANNE, TRESSEL, and BERKELEY</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sirs, take up the corse.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GENTLEMEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Towards Chertsey, noble lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, to White-Friars; there attend my coining.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Was ever woman in this humour woo'd?</LINE>
<LINE>Was ever woman in this humour won?</LINE>
<LINE>I'll have her; but I will not keep her long.</LINE>
<LINE>What! I, that kill'd her husband and his father,</LINE>
<LINE>To take her in her heart's extremest hate,</LINE>
<LINE>With curses in her mouth, tears in her eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>The bleeding witness of her hatred by;</LINE>
<LINE>Having God, her conscience, and these bars</LINE>
<LINE>against me,</LINE>
<LINE>And I nothing to back my suit at all,</LINE>
<LINE>But the plain devil and dissembling looks,</LINE>
<LINE>And yet to win her, all the world to nothing!</LINE>
<LINE>Ha!</LINE>
<LINE>Hath she forgot already that brave prince,</LINE>
<LINE>Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,</LINE>
<LINE>Stabb'd in my angry mood at Tewksbury?</LINE>
<LINE>A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman,</LINE>
<LINE>Framed in the prodigality of nature,</LINE>
<LINE>Young, valiant, wise, and, no doubt, right royal,</LINE>
<LINE>The spacious world cannot again afford</LINE>
<LINE>And will she yet debase her eyes on me,</LINE>
<LINE>That cropp'd the golden prime of this sweet prince,</LINE>
<LINE>And made her widow to a woful bed?</LINE>
<LINE>On me, whose all not equals Edward's moiety?</LINE>
<LINE>On me, that halt and am unshapen thus?</LINE>
<LINE>My dukedom to a beggarly denier,</LINE>
<LINE>I do mistake my person all this while:</LINE>
<LINE>Upon my life, she finds, although I cannot,</LINE>
<LINE>Myself to be a marvellous proper man.</LINE>
<LINE>I'll be at charges for a looking-glass,</LINE>
<LINE>And entertain some score or two of tailors,</LINE>
<LINE>To study fashions to adorn my body:</LINE>
<LINE>Since I am crept in favour with myself,</LINE>
<LINE>Will maintain it with some little cost.</LINE>
<LINE>But first I'll turn yon fellow in his grave;</LINE>
<LINE>And then return lamenting to my love.</LINE>
<LINE>Shine out, fair sun, till I have bought a glass,</LINE>
<LINE>That I may see my shadow as I pass.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>
</SCENE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE III.  The palace.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH, RIVERS, and GREY</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RIVERS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Have patience, madam: there's no doubt his majesty</LINE>
<LINE>Will soon recover his accustom'd health.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In that you brook it in, it makes him worse:</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore, for God's sake, entertain good comfort,</LINE>
<LINE>And cheer his grace with quick and merry words.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN ELIZABETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If he were dead, what would betide of me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RIVERS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No other harm but loss of such a lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN ELIZABETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The loss of such a lord includes all harm.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The heavens have bless'd you with a goodly son,</LINE>
<LINE>To be your comforter when he is gone.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN ELIZABETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Oh, he is young and his minority</LINE>
<LINE>Is put unto the trust of Richard Gloucester,</LINE>
<LINE>A man that loves not me, nor none of you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RIVERS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is it concluded that he shall be protector?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN ELIZABETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is determined, not concluded yet:</LINE>
<LINE>But so it must be, if the king miscarry.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter BUCKINGHAM and DERBY</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here come the lords of Buckingham and Derby.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BUCKINGHAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good time of day unto your royal grace!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DERBY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>God make your majesty joyful as you have been!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN ELIZABETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The Countess Richmond, good my Lord of Derby.</LINE>
<LINE>To your good prayers will scarcely say amen.</LINE>
<LINE>Yet, Derby, notwithstanding she's your wife,</LINE>
<LINE>And loves not me, be you, good lord, assured</LINE>
<LINE>I hate not you for her proud arrogance.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DERBY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do beseech you, either not believe</LINE>
<LINE>The envious slanders of her false accusers;</LINE>
<LINE>Or, if she be accused in true report,</LINE>
<LINE>Bear with her weakness, which, I think proceeds</LINE>
<LINE>From wayward sickness, and no grounded malice.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RIVERS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Saw you the king to-day, my Lord of Derby?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DERBY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But now the Duke of Buckingham and I</LINE>
<LINE>Are come from visiting his majesty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN ELIZABETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What likelihood of his amendment, lords?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BUCKINGHAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam, good hope; his grace speaks cheerfully.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN ELIZABETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>God grant him health! Did you confer with him?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BUCKINGHAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam, we did: he desires to make atonement</LINE>
<LINE>Betwixt the Duke of Gloucester and your brothers,</LINE>
<LINE>And betwixt them and my lord chamberlain;</LINE>
<LINE>And sent to warn them to his royal presence.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN ELIZABETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Would all were well! but that will never be</LINE>
<LINE>I fear our happiness is at the highest.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter GLOUCESTER, HASTINGS, and DORSET</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They do me wrong, and I will not endure it:</LINE>
<LINE>Who are they that complain unto the king,</LINE>
<LINE>That I, forsooth, am stern, and love them not?</LINE>
<LINE>By holy Paul, they love his grace but lightly</LINE>
<LINE>That fill his ears with such dissentious rumours.</LINE>
<LINE>Because I cannot flatter and speak fair,</LINE>
<LINE>Smile in men's faces, smooth, deceive and cog,</LINE>
<LINE>Duck with French nods and apish courtesy,</LINE>
<LINE>I must be held a rancorous enemy.</LINE>
<LINE>Cannot a plain man live and think no harm,</LINE>
<LINE>But thus his simple truth must be abused</LINE>
<LINE>By silken, sly, insinuating Jacks?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RIVERS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To whom in all this presence speaks your grace?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To thee, that hast nor honesty nor grace.</LINE>
<LINE>When have I injured thee? when done thee wrong?</LINE>
<LINE>Or thee? or thee? or any of your faction?</LINE>
<LINE>A plague upon you all! His royal person,--</LINE>
<LINE>Whom God preserve better than you would wish!--</LINE>
<LINE>Cannot be quiet scarce a breathing-while,</LINE>
<LINE>But you must trouble him with lewd complaints.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN ELIZABETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Brother of Gloucester, you mistake the matter.</LINE>
<LINE>The king, of his own royal disposition,</LINE>
<LINE>And not provoked by any suitor else;</LINE>
<LINE>Aiming, belike, at your interior hatred,</LINE>
<LINE>Which in your outward actions shows itself</LINE>
<LINE>Against my kindred, brothers, and myself,</LINE>
<LINE>Makes him to send; that thereby he may gather</LINE>
<LINE>The ground of your ill-will, and so remove it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I cannot tell: the world is grown so bad,</LINE>
<LINE>That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch:</LINE>
<LINE>Since every Jack became a gentleman</LINE>
<LINE>There's many a gentle person made a Jack.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN ELIZABETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, come, we know your meaning, brother</LINE>
<LINE>Gloucester;</LINE>
<LINE>You envy my advancement and my friends':</LINE>
<LINE>God grant we never may have need of you!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Meantime, God grants that we have need of you:</LINE>
<LINE>Your brother is imprison'd by your means,</LINE>
<LINE>Myself disgraced, and the nobility</LINE>
<LINE>Held in contempt; whilst many fair promotions</LINE>
<LINE>Are daily given to ennoble those</LINE>
<LINE>That scarce, some two days since, were worth a noble.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN ELIZABETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By Him that raised me to this careful height</LINE>
<LINE>From that contented hap which I enjoy'd,</LINE>
<LINE>I never did incense his majesty</LINE>
<LINE>Against the Duke of Clarence, but have been</LINE>
<LINE>An earnest advocate to plead for him.</LINE>
<LINE>My lord, you do me shameful injury,</LINE>
<LINE>Falsely to draw me in these vile suspects.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You may deny that you were not the cause</LINE>
<LINE>Of my Lord Hastings' late imprisonment.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RIVERS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She may, my lord, for--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She may, Lord Rivers! why, who knows not so?</LINE>
<LINE>She may do more, sir, than denying that:</LINE>
<LINE>She may help you to many fair preferments,</LINE>
<LINE>And then deny her aiding hand therein,</LINE>
<LINE>And lay those honours on your high deserts.</LINE>
<LINE>What may she not? She may, yea, marry, may she--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RIVERS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, marry, may she?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, marry, may she! marry with a king,</LINE>
<LINE>A bachelor, a handsome stripling too:</LINE>
<LINE>I wis your grandam had a worser match.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN ELIZABETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My Lord of Gloucester, I have too long borne</LINE>
<LINE>Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs:</LINE>
<LINE>By heaven, I will acquaint his majesty</LINE>
<LINE>With those gross taunts I often have endured.</LINE>
<LINE>I had rather be a country servant-maid</LINE>
<LINE>Than a great queen, with this condition,</LINE>
<LINE>To be thus taunted, scorn'd, and baited at:</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter QUEEN MARGARET, behind</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Small joy have I in being England's queen.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And lessen'd be that small, God, I beseech thee!</LINE>
<LINE>Thy honour, state and seat is due to me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What! threat you me with telling of the king?</LINE>
<LINE>Tell him, and spare not: look, what I have said</LINE>
<LINE>I will avouch in presence of the king:</LINE>
<LINE>I dare adventure to be sent to the Tower.</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis time to speak; my pains are quite forgot.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Out, devil! I remember them too well:</LINE>
<LINE>Thou slewest my husband Henry in the Tower,</LINE>
<LINE>And Edward, my poor son, at Tewksbury.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ere you were queen, yea, or your husband king,</LINE>
<LINE>I was a pack-horse in his great affairs;</LINE>
<LINE>A weeder-out of his proud adversaries,</LINE>
<LINE>A liberal rewarder of his friends:</LINE>
<LINE>To royalize his blood I spilt mine own.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yea, and much better blood than his or thine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In all which time you and your husband Grey</LINE>
<LINE>Were factious for the house of Lancaster;</LINE>
<LINE>And, Rivers, so were you. Was not your husband</LINE>
<LINE>In Margaret's battle at Saint Alban's slain?</LINE>
<LINE>Let me put in your minds, if you forget,</LINE>
<LINE>What you have been ere now, and what you are;</LINE>
<LINE>Withal, what I have been, and what I am.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A murderous villain, and so still thou art.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Poor Clarence did forsake his father, Warwick;</LINE>
<LINE>Yea, and forswore himself,--which Jesu pardon!--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Which God revenge!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To fight on Edward's party for the crown;</LINE>
<LINE>And for his meed, poor lord, he is mew'd up.</LINE>
<LINE>I would to God my heart were flint, like Edward's;</LINE>
<LINE>Or Edward's soft and pitiful, like mine</LINE>
<LINE>I am too childish-foolish for this world.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hie thee to hell for shame, and leave the world,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou cacodemon! there thy kingdom is.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RIVERS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My Lord of Gloucester, in those busy days</LINE>
<LINE>Which here you urge to prove us enemies,</LINE>
<LINE>We follow'd then our lord, our lawful king:</LINE>
<LINE>So should we you, if you should be our king.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If I should be! I had rather be a pedlar:</LINE>
<LINE>Far be it from my heart, the thought of it!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN ELIZABETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As little joy, my lord, as you suppose</LINE>
<LINE>You should enjoy, were you this country's king,</LINE>
<LINE>As little joy may you suppose in me.</LINE>
<LINE>That I enjoy, being the queen thereof.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A little joy enjoys the queen thereof;</LINE>
<LINE>For I am she, and altogether joyless.</LINE>
<LINE>I can no longer hold me patient.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Advancing</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Hear me, you wrangling pirates, that fall out</LINE>
<LINE>In sharing that which you have pill'd from me!</LINE>
<LINE>Which of you trembles not that looks on me?</LINE>
<LINE>If not, that, I being queen, you bow like subjects,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet that, by you deposed, you quake like rebels?</LINE>
<LINE>O gentle villain, do not turn away!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Foul wrinkled witch, what makest thou in my sight?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But repetition of what thou hast marr'd;</LINE>
<LINE>That will I make before I let thee go.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Wert thou not banished on pain of death?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I was; but I do find more pain in banishment</LINE>
<LINE>Than death can yield me here by my abode.</LINE>
<LINE>A husband and a son thou owest to me;</LINE>
<LINE>And thou a kingdom; all of you allegiance:</LINE>
<LINE>The sorrow that I have, by right is yours,</LINE>
<LINE>And all the pleasures you usurp are mine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The curse my noble father laid on thee,</LINE>
<LINE>When thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper</LINE>
<LINE>And with thy scorns drew'st rivers from his eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>And then, to dry them, gavest the duke a clout</LINE>
<LINE>Steep'd in the faultless blood of pretty Rutland--</LINE>
<LINE>His curses, then from bitterness of soul</LINE>
<LINE>Denounced against thee, are all fall'n upon thee;</LINE>
<LINE>And God, not we, hath plagued thy bloody deed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN ELIZABETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So just is God, to right the innocent.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, 'twas the foulest deed to slay that babe,</LINE>
<LINE>And the most merciless that e'er was heard of!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RIVERS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tyrants themselves wept when it was reported.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DORSET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No man but prophesied revenge for it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BUCKINGHAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Northumberland, then present, wept to see it.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What were you snarling all before I came,</LINE>
<LINE>Ready to catch each other by the throat,</LINE>
<LINE>And turn you all your hatred now on me?</LINE>
<LINE>Did York's dread curse prevail so much with heaven?</LINE>
<LINE>That Henry's death, my lovely Edward's death,</LINE>
<LINE>Their kingdom's loss, my woful banishment,</LINE>
<LINE>Could all but answer for that peevish brat?</LINE>
<LINE>Can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven?</LINE>
<LINE>Why, then, give way, dull clouds, to my quick curses!</LINE>
<LINE>If not by war, by surfeit die your king,</LINE>
<LINE>As ours by murder, to make him a king!</LINE>
<LINE>Edward thy son, which now is Prince of Wales,</LINE>
<LINE>For Edward my son, which was Prince of Wales,</LINE>
<LINE>Die in his youth by like untimely violence!</LINE>
<LINE>Thyself a queen, for me that was a queen,</LINE>
<LINE>Outlive thy glory, like my wretched self!</LINE>
<LINE>Long mayst thou live to wail thy children's loss;</LINE>
<LINE>And see another, as I see thee now,</LINE>
<LINE>Deck'd in thy rights, as thou art stall'd in mine!</LINE>
<LINE>Long die thy happy days before thy death;</LINE>
<LINE>And, after many lengthen'd hours of grief,</LINE>
<LINE>Die neither mother, wife, nor England's queen!</LINE>
<LINE>Rivers and Dorset, you were standers by,</LINE>
<LINE>And so wast thou, Lord Hastings, when my son</LINE>
<LINE>Was stabb'd with bloody daggers: God, I pray him,</LINE>
<LINE>That none of you may live your natural age,</LINE>
<LINE>But by some unlook'd accident cut off!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Have done thy charm, thou hateful wither'd hag!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And leave out thee? stay, dog, for thou shalt hear me.</LINE>
<LINE>If heaven have any grievous plague in store</LINE>
<LINE>Exceeding those that I can wish upon thee,</LINE>
<LINE>O, let them keep it till thy sins be ripe,</LINE>
<LINE>And then hurl down their indignation</LINE>
<LINE>On thee, the troubler of the poor world's peace!</LINE>
<LINE>The worm of conscience still begnaw thy soul!</LINE>
<LINE>Thy friends suspect for traitors while thou livest,</LINE>
<LINE>And take deep traitors for thy dearest friends!</LINE>
<LINE>No sleep close up that deadly eye of thine,</LINE>
<LINE>Unless it be whilst some tormenting dream</LINE>
<LINE>Affrights thee with a hell of ugly devils!</LINE>
<LINE>Thou elvish-mark'd, abortive, rooting hog!</LINE>
<LINE>Thou that wast seal'd in thy nativity</LINE>
<LINE>The slave of nature and the son of hell!</LINE>
<LINE>Thou slander of thy mother's heavy womb!</LINE>

<LINE>Ha!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I call thee not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I cry thee mercy then, for I had thought</LINE>
<LINE>That thou hadst call'd me all these bitter names.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, so I did; but look'd for no reply.</LINE>
<LINE>O, let me make the period to my curse!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis done by me, and ends in 'Margaret.'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN ELIZABETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thus have you breathed your curse against yourself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Poor painted queen, vain flourish of my fortune!</LINE>
<LINE>Why strew'st thou sugar on that bottled spider,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose deadly web ensnareth thee about?</LINE>
<LINE>Fool, fool! thou whet'st a knife to kill thyself.</LINE>
<LINE>The time will come when thou shalt wish for me</LINE>
<LINE>To help thee curse that poisonous bunchback'd toad.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>False-boding woman, end thy frantic curse,</LINE>
<LINE>Lest to thy harm thou move our patience.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Foul shame upon you! you have all moved mine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RIVERS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Were you well served, you would be taught your duty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To serve me well, you all should do me duty,</LINE>
<LINE>Teach me to be your queen, and you my subjects:</LINE>
<LINE>O, serve me well, and teach yourselves that duty!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DORSET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Dispute not with her; she is lunatic.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Peace, master marquess, you are malapert:</LINE>
<LINE>Your fire-new stamp of honour is scarce current.</LINE>
<LINE>O, that your young nobility could judge</LINE>
<LINE>What 'twere to lose it, and be miserable!</LINE>
<LINE>They that stand high have many blasts to shake them;</LINE>
<LINE>And if they fall, they dash themselves to pieces.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good counsel, marry: learn it, learn it, marquess.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DORSET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It toucheth you, my lord, as much as me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yea, and much more: but I was born so high,</LINE>
<LINE>Our aery buildeth in the cedar's top,</LINE>
<LINE>And dallies with the wind and scorns the sun.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And turns the sun to shade; alas! alas!</LINE>
<LINE>Witness my son, now in the shade of death;</LINE>
<LINE>Whose bright out-shining beams thy cloudy wrath</LINE>
<LINE>Hath in eternal darkness folded up.</LINE>
<LINE>Your aery buildeth in our aery's nest.</LINE>
<LINE>O God, that seest it, do not suffer it!</LINE>
<LINE>As it was won with blood, lost be it so!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BUCKINGHAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Have done! for shame, if not for charity.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Urge neither charity nor shame to me:</LINE>
<LINE>Uncharitably with me have you dealt,</LINE>
<LINE>And shamefully by you my hopes are butcher'd.</LINE>
<LINE>My charity is outrage, life my shame</LINE>
<LINE>And in that shame still live my sorrow's rage.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BUCKINGHAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Have done, have done.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O princely Buckingham I'll kiss thy hand,</LINE>
<LINE>In sign of league and amity with thee:</LINE>
<LINE>Now fair befal thee and thy noble house!</LINE>
<LINE>Thy garments are not spotted with our blood,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor thou within the compass of my curse.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BUCKINGHAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nor no one here; for curses never pass</LINE>
<LINE>The lips of those that breathe them in the air.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll not believe but they ascend the sky,</LINE>
<LINE>And there awake God's gentle-sleeping peace.</LINE>
<LINE>O Buckingham, take heed of yonder dog!</LINE>
<LINE>Look, when he fawns, he bites; and when he bites,</LINE>
<LINE>His venom tooth will rankle to the death:</LINE>
<LINE>Have not to do with him, beware of him;</LINE>
<LINE>Sin, death, and hell have set their marks on him,</LINE>
<LINE>And all their ministers attend on him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What doth she say, my Lord of Buckingham?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BUCKINGHAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nothing that I respect, my gracious lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel?</LINE>
<LINE>And soothe the devil that I warn thee from?</LINE>
<LINE>O, but remember this another day,</LINE>
<LINE>When he shall split thy very heart with sorrow,</LINE>
<LINE>And say poor Margaret was a prophetess!</LINE>
<LINE>Live each of you the subjects to his hate,</LINE>
<LINE>And he to yours, and all of you to God's!</LINE>

<SPEAKER>HASTINGS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My hair doth stand on end to hear her curses.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RIVERS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And so doth mine: I muse why she's at liberty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I cannot blame her: by God's holy mother,</LINE>
<LINE>She hath had too much wrong; and I repent</LINE>
<LINE>My part thereof that I have done to her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN ELIZABETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I never did her any, to my knowledge.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But you have all the vantage of her wrong.</LINE>
<LINE>I was too hot to do somebody good,</LINE>
<LINE>That is too cold in thinking of it now.</LINE>
<LINE>Marry, as for Clarence, he is well repaid,</LINE>
<LINE>He is frank'd up to fatting for his pains</LINE>
<LINE>God pardon them that are the cause of it!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RIVERS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A virtuous and a Christian-like conclusion,</LINE>
<LINE>To pray for them that have done scathe to us.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So do I ever:</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>being well-advised.</LINE>
<LINE>For had I cursed now, I had cursed myself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter CATESBY</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CATESBY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam, his majesty doth call for you,</LINE>
<LINE>And for your grace; and you, my noble lords.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN ELIZABETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Catesby, we come. Lords, will you go with us?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RIVERS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam, we will attend your grace.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do the wrong, and first begin to brawl.</LINE>
<LINE>The secret mischiefs that I set abroach</LINE>
<LINE>I lay unto the grievous charge of others.</LINE>
<LINE>Clarence, whom I, indeed, have laid in darkness,</LINE>
<LINE>I do beweep to many simple gulls</LINE>
<LINE>Namely, to Hastings, Derby, Buckingham;</LINE>
<LINE>And say it is the queen and her allies</LINE>
<LINE>That stir the king against the duke my brother.</LINE>
<LINE>Now, they believe it; and withal whet me</LINE>
<LINE>To be revenged on Rivers, Vaughan, Grey:</LINE>
<LINE>But then I sigh; and, with a piece of scripture,</LINE>
<LINE>Tell them that God bids us do good for evil:</LINE>
<LINE>And thus I clothe my naked villany</LINE>
<LINE>With old odd ends stolen out of holy writ;</LINE>
<LINE>And seem a saint, when most I play the devil.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter two Murderers</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>But, soft! here come my executioners.</LINE>
<LINE>How now, my hardy, stout resolved mates!</LINE>
<LINE>Are you now going to dispatch this deed?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Murderer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We are, my lord; and come to have the warrant</LINE>
<LINE>That we may be admitted where he is.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well thought upon; I have it here about me.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Gives the warrant</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>When you have done, repair to Crosby Place.</LINE>
<LINE>But, sirs, be sudden in the execution,</LINE>
<LINE>Withal obdurate, do not hear him plead;</LINE>
<LINE>For Clarence is well-spoken, and perhaps</LINE>
<LINE>May move your hearts to pity if you mark him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Murderer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tush!</LINE>
<LINE>Fear not, my lord, we will not stand to prate;</LINE>
<LINE>Talkers are no good doers: be assured</LINE>
<LINE>We come to use our hands and not our tongues.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your eyes drop millstones, when fools' eyes drop tears:</LINE>
<LINE>I like you, lads; about your business straight;</LINE>
<LINE>Go, go, dispatch.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Murderer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We will, my noble lord.</LINE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE IV.  London. The Tower.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter CLARENCE and BRAKENBURY</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRAKENBURY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why looks your grace so heavily today?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLARENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, I have pass'd a miserable night,</LINE>
<LINE>So full of ugly sights, of ghastly dreams,</LINE>
<LINE>That, as I am a Christian faithful man,</LINE>
<LINE>I would not spend another such a night,</LINE>
<LINE>Though 'twere to buy a world of happy days,</LINE>
<LINE>So full of dismal terror was the time!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRAKENBURY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What was your dream? I long to hear you tell it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLARENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower,</LINE>
<LINE>And was embark'd to cross to Burgundy;</LINE>
<LINE>And, in my company, my brother Gloucester;</LINE>
<LINE>Who from my cabin tempted me to walk</LINE>
<LINE>Upon the hatches: thence we looked toward England,</LINE>
<LINE>And cited up a thousand fearful times,</LINE>
<LINE>During the wars of York and Lancaster</LINE>
<LINE>That had befall'n us. As we paced along</LINE>
<LINE>Upon the giddy footing of the hatches,</LINE>
<LINE>Methought that Gloucester stumbled; and, in falling,</LINE>
<LINE>Struck me, that thought to stay him, overboard,</LINE>
<LINE>Into the tumbling billows of the main.</LINE>
<LINE>Lord, Lord! methought, what pain it was to drown!</LINE>
<LINE>What dreadful noise of waters in mine ears!</LINE>
<LINE>What ugly sights of death within mine eyes!</LINE>
<LINE>Methought I saw a thousand fearful wrecks;</LINE>
<LINE>Ten thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon;</LINE>
<LINE>Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,</LINE>
<LINE>Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,</LINE>
<LINE>All scatter'd in the bottom of the sea:</LINE>
<LINE>Some lay in dead men's skulls; and, in those holes</LINE>
<LINE>Where eyes did once inhabit, there were crept,</LINE>
<LINE>As 'twere in scorn of eyes, reflecting gems,</LINE>
<LINE>Which woo'd the slimy bottom of the deep,</LINE>
<LINE>And mock'd the dead bones that lay scatter'd by.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRAKENBURY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Had you such leisure in the time of death</LINE>
<LINE>To gaze upon the secrets of the deep?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLARENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Methought I had; and often did I strive</LINE>
<LINE>To yield the ghost: but still the envious flood</LINE>
<LINE>Kept in my soul, and would not let it forth</LINE>
<LINE>To seek the empty, vast and wandering air;</LINE>
<LINE>But smother'd it within my panting bulk,</LINE>
<LINE>Which almost burst to belch it in the sea.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRAKENBURY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Awaked you not with this sore agony?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLARENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, no, my dream was lengthen'd after life;</LINE>
<LINE>O, then began the tempest to my soul,</LINE>
<LINE>Who pass'd, methought, the melancholy flood,</LINE>
<LINE>With that grim ferryman which poets write of,</LINE>
<LINE>Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.</LINE>
<LINE>The first that there did greet my stranger soul,</LINE>
<LINE>Was my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick;</LINE>
<LINE>Who cried aloud, 'What scourge for perjury</LINE>
<LINE>Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?'</LINE>
<LINE>And so he vanish'd: then came wandering by</LINE>
<LINE>A shadow like an angel, with bright hair</LINE>
<LINE>Dabbled in blood; and he squeak'd out aloud,</LINE>
<LINE>'Clarence is come; false, fleeting, perjured Clarence,</LINE>
<LINE>That stabb'd me in the field by Tewksbury;</LINE>
<LINE>Seize on him, Furies, take him to your torments!'</LINE>
<LINE>With that, methoughts, a legion of foul fiends</LINE>
<LINE>Environ'd me about, and howled in mine ears</LINE>
<LINE>Such hideous cries, that with the very noise</LINE>
<LINE>I trembling waked, and for a season after</LINE>
<LINE>Could not believe but that I was in hell,</LINE>
<LINE>Such terrible impression made the dream.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRAKENBURY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No marvel, my lord, though it affrighted you;</LINE>
<LINE>I promise, I am afraid to hear you tell it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLARENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O Brakenbury, I have done those things,</LINE>
<LINE>Which now bear evidence against my soul,</LINE>
<LINE>For Edward's sake; and see how he requites me!</LINE>
<LINE>O God! if my deep prayers cannot appease thee,</LINE>
<LINE>But thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet execute thy wrath in me alone,</LINE>
<LINE>O, spare my guiltless wife and my poor children!</LINE>
<LINE>I pray thee, gentle keeper, stay by me;</LINE>
<LINE>My soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRAKENBURY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will, my lord: God give your grace good rest!</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>CLARENCE sleeps</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours,</LINE>
<LINE>Makes the night morning, and the noon-tide night.</LINE>
<LINE>Princes have but their tides for their glories,</LINE>
<LINE>An outward honour for an inward toil;</LINE>
<LINE>And, for unfelt imagination,</LINE>
<LINE>They often feel a world of restless cares:</LINE>
<LINE>So that, betwixt their tides and low names,</LINE>
<LINE>There's nothing differs but the outward fame.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter the two Murderers</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Murderer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ho! who's here?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRAKENBURY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In God's name what are you, and how came you hither?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Murderer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would speak with Clarence, and I came hither on my legs.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRAKENBURY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yea, are you so brief?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Murderer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O sir, it is better to be brief than tedious. Show</LINE>
<LINE>him our commission; talk no more.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>BRAKENBURY reads it</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRAKENBURY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am, in this, commanded to deliver</LINE>
<LINE>The noble Duke of Clarence to your hands:</LINE>
<LINE>I will not reason what is meant hereby,</LINE>
<LINE>Because I will be guiltless of the meaning.</LINE>
<LINE>Here are the keys, there sits the duke asleep:</LINE>
<LINE>I'll to the king; and signify to him</LINE>
<LINE>That thus I have resign'd my charge to you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Murderer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do so, it is a point of wisdom: fare you well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit BRAKENBURY</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Murderer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, shall we stab him as he sleeps?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Murderer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No; then he will say 'twas done cowardly, when he wakes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Murderer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>When he wakes! why, fool, he shall never wake till</LINE>
<LINE>the judgment-day.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Murderer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, then he will say we stabbed him sleeping.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Murderer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The urging of that word 'judgment' hath bred a kind</LINE>
<LINE>of remorse in me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Murderer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, art thou afraid?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Murderer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not to kill him, having a warrant for it; but to be</LINE>
<LINE>damned for killing him, from which no warrant can defend us.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Murderer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I thought thou hadst been resolute.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Murderer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So I am, to let him live.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Murderer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Back to the Duke of Gloucester, tell him so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Murderer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I pray thee, stay a while: I hope my holy humour</LINE>
<LINE>will change; 'twas wont to hold me but while one</LINE>
<LINE>would tell twenty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Murderer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How dost thou feel thyself now?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Murderer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Faith, some certain dregs of conscience are yet</LINE>
<LINE>within me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Murderer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Remember our reward, when the deed is done.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Murderer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Zounds, he dies: I had forgot the reward.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Murderer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where is thy conscience now?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Murderer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In the Duke of Gloucester's purse.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Murderer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So when he opens his purse to give us our reward,</LINE>
<LINE>thy conscience flies out.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Murderer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let it go; there's few or none will entertain it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Murderer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How if it come to thee again?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Murderer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll not meddle with it: it is a dangerous thing: it</LINE>
<LINE>makes a man a coward: a man cannot steal, but it</LINE>
<LINE>accuseth him; he cannot swear, but it cheques him;</LINE>
<LINE>he cannot lie with his neighbour's wife, but it</LINE>
<LINE>detects him: 'tis a blushing shamefast spirit that</LINE>
<LINE>mutinies in a man's bosom; it fills one full of</LINE>
<LINE>obstacles: it made me once restore a purse of gold</LINE>
<LINE>that I found; it beggars any man that keeps it: it</LINE>
<LINE>is turned out of all towns and cities for a</LINE>
<LINE>dangerous thing; and every man that means to live</LINE>
<LINE>well endeavours to trust to himself and to live</LINE>
<LINE>without it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>'Zounds, it is even now at my elbow, persuading me</LINE>
<LINE>not to kill the duke.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Murderer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Take the devil in thy mind, and relieve him not: he</LINE>
<LINE>would insinuate with thee but to make thee sigh.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Murderer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tut, I am strong-framed, he cannot prevail with me,</LINE>
<LINE>I warrant thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Murderer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Spoke like a tail fellow that respects his</LINE>
<LINE>reputation. Come, shall we to this gear?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Murderer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Take him over the costard with the hilts of thy</LINE>
<LINE>sword, and then we will chop him in the malmsey-butt</LINE>
<LINE>in the next room.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Murderer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O excellent devise! make a sop of him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Murderer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hark! he stirs: shall I strike?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Murderer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, first let's reason with him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLARENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where art thou, keeper? give me a cup of wine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second murderer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You shall have wine enough, my lord, anon.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLARENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In God's name, what art thou?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Murderer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A man, as you are.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLARENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But not, as I am, royal.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Murderer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nor you, as we are, loyal.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLARENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thy voice is thunder, but thy looks are humble.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Murderer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My voice is now the king's, my looks mine own.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLARENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How darkly and how deadly dost thou speak!</LINE>
<LINE>Your eyes do menace me: why look you pale?</LINE>
<LINE>Who sent you hither? Wherefore do you come?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Both</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To, to, to--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLARENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To murder me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Both</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, ay.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLARENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so,</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it.</LINE>
<LINE>Wherein, my friends, have I offended you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Murderer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Offended us you have not, but the king.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLARENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I shall be reconciled to him again.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Murderer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Never, my lord; therefore prepare to die.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLARENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Are you call'd forth from out a world of men</LINE>
<LINE>To slay the innocent? What is my offence?</LINE>
<LINE>Where are the evidence that do accuse me?</LINE>
<LINE>What lawful quest have given their verdict up</LINE>
<LINE>Unto the frowning judge? or who pronounced</LINE>
<LINE>The bitter sentence of poor Clarence' death?</LINE>
<LINE>Before I be convict by course of law,</LINE>
<LINE>To threaten me with death is most unlawful.</LINE>
<LINE>I charge you, as you hope to have redemption</LINE>
<LINE>By Christ's dear blood shed for our grievous sins,</LINE>
<LINE>That you depart and lay no hands on me</LINE>
<LINE>The deed you undertake is damnable.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Murderer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What we will do, we do upon command.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Murderer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And he that hath commanded is the king.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLARENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Erroneous vassal! the great King of kings</LINE>
<LINE>Hath in the tables of his law commanded</LINE>
<LINE>That thou shalt do no murder: and wilt thou, then,</LINE>
<LINE>Spurn at his edict and fulfil a man's?</LINE>
<LINE>Take heed; for he holds vengeance in his hands,</LINE>
<LINE>To hurl upon their heads that break his law.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Murderer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And that same vengeance doth he hurl on thee,</LINE>
<LINE>For false forswearing and for murder too:</LINE>
<LINE>Thou didst receive the holy sacrament,</LINE>
<LINE>To fight in quarrel of the house of Lancaster.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Murderer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And, like a traitor to the name of God,</LINE>
<LINE>Didst break that vow; and with thy treacherous blade</LINE>
<LINE>Unrip'dst the bowels of thy sovereign's son.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Murderer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Whom thou wert sworn to cherish and defend.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Murderer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How canst thou urge God's dreadful law to us,</LINE>
<LINE>When thou hast broke it in so dear degree?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLARENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alas! for whose sake did I that ill deed?</LINE>
<LINE>For Edward, for my brother, for his sake: Why, sirs,</LINE>
<LINE>He sends ye not to murder me for this</LINE>
<LINE>For in this sin he is as deep as I.</LINE>
<LINE>If God will be revenged for this deed.</LINE>
<LINE>O, know you yet, he doth it publicly,</LINE>
<LINE>Take not the quarrel from his powerful arm;</LINE>
<LINE>He needs no indirect nor lawless course</LINE>
<LINE>To cut off those that have offended him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Murderer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who made thee, then, a bloody minister,</LINE>
<LINE>When gallant-springing brave Plantagenet,</LINE>
<LINE>That princely novice, was struck dead by thee?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLARENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My brother's love, the devil, and my rage.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Murderer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thy brother's love, our duty, and thy fault,</LINE>
<LINE>Provoke us hither now to slaughter thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLARENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Oh, if you love my brother, hate not me;</LINE>
<LINE>I am his brother, and I love him well.</LINE>
<LINE>If you be hired for meed, go back again,</LINE>
<LINE>And I will send you to my brother Gloucester,</LINE>
<LINE>Who shall reward you better for my life</LINE>
<LINE>Than Edward will for tidings of my death.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Murderer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You are deceived, your brother Gloucester hates you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLARENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, no, he loves me, and he holds me dear:</LINE>
<LINE>Go you to him from me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Both</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, so we will.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLARENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tell him, when that our princely father York</LINE>
<LINE>Bless'd his three sons with his victorious arm,</LINE>
<LINE>And charged us from his soul to love each other,</LINE>
<LINE>He little thought of this divided friendship:</LINE>
<LINE>Bid Gloucester think of this, and he will weep.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Murderer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, millstones; as be lesson'd us to weep.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLARENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, do not slander him, for he is kind.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Murderer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Right,</LINE>
<LINE>As snow in harvest. Thou deceivest thyself:</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis he that sent us hither now to slaughter thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLARENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It cannot be; for when I parted with him,</LINE>
<LINE>He hugg'd me in his arms, and swore, with sobs,</LINE>
<LINE>That he would labour my delivery.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Murderer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, so he doth, now he delivers thee</LINE>
<LINE>From this world's thraldom to the joys of heaven.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Murderer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Make peace with God, for you must die, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLARENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hast thou that holy feeling in thy soul,</LINE>
<LINE>To counsel me to make my peace with God,</LINE>
<LINE>And art thou yet to thy own soul so blind,</LINE>
<LINE>That thou wilt war with God by murdering me?</LINE>
<LINE>Ah, sirs, consider, he that set you on</LINE>
<LINE>To do this deed will hate you for the deed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Murderer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What shall we do?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLARENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Relent, and save your souls.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Murderer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Relent! 'tis cowardly and womanish.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLARENCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not to relent is beastly, savage, devilish.</LINE>
<LINE>Which of you, if you were a prince's son,</LINE>
<LINE>Being pent from liberty, as I am now,</LINE>
<LINE>if two such murderers as yourselves came to you,</LINE>
<LINE>Would not entreat for life?</LINE>
<LINE>My friend, I spy some pity in thy looks:</LINE>
<LINE>O, if thine eye be not a flatterer,</LINE>
<LINE>Come thou on my side, and entreat for me,</LINE>
<LINE>As you would beg, were you in my distress</LINE>
<LINE>A begging prince what beggar pities not?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Murderer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Look behind you, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Murderer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Take that, and that: if all this will not do,</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Stabs him</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>I'll drown you in the malmsey-butt within.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit, with the body</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Murderer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A bloody deed, and desperately dispatch'd!</LINE>
<LINE>How fain, like Pilate, would I wash my hands</LINE>
<LINE>Of this most grievous guilty murder done!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Re-enter First Murderer</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Murderer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How now! what mean'st thou, that thou help'st me not?</LINE>
<LINE>By heavens, the duke shall know how slack thou art!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Murderer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would he knew that I had saved his brother!</LINE>
<LINE>Take thou the fee, and tell him what I say;</LINE>
<LINE>For I repent me that the duke is slain.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Murderer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So do not I: go, coward as thou art.</LINE>
<LINE>Now must I hide his body in some hole,</LINE>
<LINE>Until the duke take order for his burial:</LINE>
<LINE>And when I have my meed, I must away;</LINE>
<LINE>For this will out, and here I must not stay.</LINE>

<LINE>Deep, hollow, treacherous, and full of guile,</LINE>
<LINE>Be he unto me! this do I beg of God,</LINE>

<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD IV</SPEAKER>

<LINE>Good morrow to my sovereign king and queen:</LINE>
<LINE>And, princely peers, a happy time of day!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD IV</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Happy, indeed, as we have spent the day.</LINE>
<LINE>Brother, we done deeds of charity;</LINE>
<LINE>Made peace enmity, fair love of hate,</LINE>
<LINE>Between these swelling wrong-incensed peers.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A blessed labour, my most sovereign liege:</LINE>
<LINE>Amongst this princely heap, if any here,</LINE>
<LINE>By false intelligence, or wrong surmise,</LINE>
<LINE>Hold me a foe;</LINE>
<LINE>If I unwittingly, or in my rage,</LINE>
<LINE>Have aught committed that is hardly borne</LINE>
<LINE>By any in this presence, I desire</LINE>
<LINE>To reconcile me to his friendly peace:</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis death to me to be at enmity;</LINE>
<LINE>I hate it, and desire all good men's love.</LINE>
<LINE>First, madam, I entreat true peace of you,</LINE>
<LINE>Which I will purchase with my duteous service;</LINE>
<LINE>Of you, my noble cousin Buckingham,</LINE>
<LINE>If ever any grudge were lodged between us;</LINE>
<LINE>Of you, Lord Rivers, and, Lord Grey, of you;</LINE>
<LINE>That without desert have frown'd on me;</LINE>
<LINE>Dukes, earls, lords, gentlemen; indeed, of all.</LINE>
<LINE>I do not know that Englishman alive</LINE>
<LINE>With whom my soul is any jot at odds</LINE>
<LINE>More than the infant that is born to-night</LINE>
<LINE>I thank my God for my humility.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN ELIZABETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A holy day shall this be kept hereafter:</LINE>
<LINE>I would to God all strifes were well compounded.</LINE>
<LINE>My sovereign liege, I do beseech your majesty</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD IV</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is Clarence dead? the order was reversed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But he, poor soul, by your first order died,</LINE>
<LINE>And that a winged Mercury did bear:</LINE>
<LINE>Some tardy cripple bore the countermand,</LINE>
<LINE>That came too lag to see him buried.</LINE>
<LINE>God grant that some, less noble and less loyal,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DORSET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The forfeit, sovereign, of my servant's life;</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD IV</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Have a tongue to doom my brother's death,</LINE>
<LINE>And shall the same give pardon to a slave?</LINE>
<LINE>My brother slew no man; his fault was thought,</LINE>
<LINE>And yet his punishment was cruel death.</LINE>
<LINE>Who sued to me for him? who, in my rage,</LINE>
<LINE>Kneel'd at my feet, and bade me be advised</LINE>
<LINE>Who spake of brotherhood? who spake of love?</LINE>
<LINE>Who told me how the poor soul did forsake</LINE>
<LINE>The mighty Warwick, and did fight for me?</LINE>
<LINE>Who told me, in the field by Tewksbury</LINE>
<LINE>When Oxford had me down, he rescued me,</LINE>
<LINE>And said, 'Dear brother, live, and be a king'?</LINE>
<LINE>Who told me, when we both lay in the field</LINE>
<LINE>Frozen almost to death, how he did lap me</LINE>
<LINE>Even in his own garments, and gave himself,</LINE>
<LINE>All thin and naked, to the numb cold night?</LINE>
<LINE>All this from my remembrance brutish wrath</LINE>
<LINE>Sinfully pluck'd, and not a man of you</LINE>
<LINE>Had so much grace to put it in my mind.</LINE>
<LINE>But when your carters or your waiting-vassals</LINE>
<LINE>Have done a drunken slaughter, and defaced</LINE>
<LINE>The precious image of our dear Redeemer,</LINE>
<LINE>You straight are on your knees for pardon, pardon;</LINE>
<LINE>And I unjustly too, must grant it you</LINE>
<LINE>But for my brother not a man would speak,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor I, ungracious, speak unto myself</LINE>
<LINE>For him, poor soul. The proudest of you all</LINE>
<LINE>Have been beholding to him in his life;</LINE>
<LINE>Yet none of you would once plead for his life.</LINE>
<LINE>O God, I fear thy justice will take hold</LINE>
<LINE>On me, and you, and mine, and yours for this!</LINE>
<LINE>Come, Hastings, help me to my closet.</LINE>
<LINE>Oh, poor Clarence!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt some with KING EDWARD IV and QUEEN MARGARET</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is the fruit of rashness! Mark'd you not</LINE>
<LINE>How that the guilty kindred of the queen</LINE>
<LINE>Look'd pale when they did hear of Clarence' death?</LINE>
<LINE>O, they did urge it still unto the king!</LINE>
<LINE>God will revenge it. But come, let us in,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Boy</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tell me, good grandam, is our father dead?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUCHESS OF YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, boy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Boy</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why do you wring your hands, and beat your breast,</LINE>
<LINE>And cry 'O Clarence, my unhappy son!'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Girl</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why do you look on us, and shake your head,</LINE>
<LINE>And call us wretches, orphans, castaways</LINE>
<LINE>If that our noble father be alive?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUCHESS OF YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My pretty cousins, you mistake me much;</LINE>
<LINE>I do lament the sickness of the king.</LINE>
<LINE>As loath to lose him, not your father's death;</LINE>
<LINE>It were lost sorrow to wail one that's lost.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Boy</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then, grandam, you conclude that he is dead.</LINE>
<LINE>The king my uncle is to blame for this:</LINE>
<LINE>God will revenge it; whom I will importune</LINE>
<LINE>With daily prayers all to that effect.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEAKER>DUCHESS OF YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Peace, children, peace! the king doth love you well:</LINE>
<LINE>Incapable and shallow innocents,</LINE>
<LINE>You cannot guess who caused your father's death.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Boy</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Grandam, we can; for my good uncle Gloucester</LINE>
<LINE>Told me, the king, provoked by the queen,</LINE>
<LINE>Devised impeachments to imprison him :</LINE>
<LINE>And when my uncle told me so, he wept,</LINE>
<LINE>And hugg'd me in his arm, and kindly kiss'd my cheek;</LINE>
<LINE>Bade me rely on him as on my father,</LINE>
<LINE>And he would love me dearly as his child.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUCHESS OF YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Oh, that deceit should steal such gentle shapes,</LINE>
<LINE>And with a virtuous vizard hide foul guile!</LINE>
<LINE>He is my son; yea, and therein my shame;</LINE>
<LINE>Yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Boy</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Think you my uncle did dissemble, grandam?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUCHESS OF YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, boy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Boy</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I cannot think it. Hark! what noise is this?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH, with her hair about her
ears; RIVERS, and DORSET after her</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN ELIZABETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Oh, who shall hinder me to wail and weep,</LINE>
<LINE>To chide my fortune, and torment myself?</LINE>
<LINE>I'll join with black despair against my soul,</LINE>
<LINE>And to myself become an enemy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUCHESS OF YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What means this scene of rude impatience?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN ELIZABETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To make an act of tragic violence:</LINE>
<LINE>Edward, my lord, your son, our king, is dead.</LINE>
<LINE>Why grow the branches now the root is wither'd?</LINE>
<LINE>Why wither not the leaves the sap being gone?</LINE>
<LINE>If you will live, lament; if die, be brief,</LINE>
<LINE>That our swift-winged souls may catch the king's;</LINE>
<LINE>Or, like obedient subjects, follow him</LINE>
<LINE>To his new kingdom of perpetual rest.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUCHESS OF YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ah, so much interest have I in thy sorrow</LINE>
<LINE>As I had title in thy noble husband!</LINE>
<LINE>I have bewept a worthy husband's death,</LINE>
<LINE>And lived by looking on his images:</LINE>
<LINE>But now two mirrors of his princely semblance</LINE>
<LINE>Are crack'd in pieces by malignant death,</LINE>
<LINE>And I for comfort have but one false glass,</LINE>
<LINE>Which grieves me when I see my shame in him.</LINE>
<LINE>Thou art a widow; yet thou art a mother,</LINE>
<LINE>And hast the comfort of thy children left thee:</LINE>
<LINE>But death hath snatch'd my husband from mine arms,</LINE>
<LINE>And pluck'd two crutches from my feeble limbs,</LINE>
<LINE>Edward and Clarence. O, what cause have I,</LINE>
<LINE>Thine being but a moiety of my grief,</LINE>
<LINE>To overgo thy plaints and drown thy cries!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Boy</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good aunt, you wept not for our father's death;</LINE>
<LINE>How can we aid you with our kindred tears?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Girl</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Our fatherless distress was left unmoan'd;</LINE>
<LINE>Your widow-dolour likewise be unwept!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN ELIZABETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Give me no help in lamentation;</LINE>
<LINE>I am not barren to bring forth complaints</LINE>
<LINE>All springs reduce their currents to mine eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>That I, being govern'd by the watery moon,</LINE>
<LINE>May send forth plenteous tears to drown the world!</LINE>
<LINE>Oh for my husband, for my dear lord Edward!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Children</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Oh for our father, for our dear lord Clarence!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUCHESS OF YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alas for both, both mine, Edward and Clarence!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEAKER>DUCHESS OF YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Was never mother had so dear a loss!</LINE>
<LINE>Alas, I am the mother of these moans!</LINE>
<LINE>Their woes are parcell'd, mine are general.</LINE>
<LINE>She for an Edward weeps, and so do I;</LINE>
<LINE>I for a Clarence weep, so doth not she:</LINE>
<LINE>These babes for Clarence weep and so do I;</LINE>
<LINE>I for an Edward weep, so do not they:</LINE>
<LINE>Alas, you three, on me, threefold distress'd,</LINE>
<LINE>Pour all your tears! I am your sorrow's nurse,</LINE>
<LINE>And I will pamper it with lamentations.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DORSET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Comfort, dear mother: God is much displeased</LINE>
<LINE>That you take with unthankfulness, his doing:</LINE>
<LINE>In common worldly things, 'tis call'd ungrateful,</LINE>
<LINE>With dull unwilligness to repay a debt</LINE>
<LINE>Which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent;</LINE>
<LINE>Much more to be thus opposite with heaven,</LINE>
<LINE>For it requires the royal debt it lent you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RIVERS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam, bethink you, like a careful mother,</LINE>
<LINE>Of the young prince your son: send straight for him</LINE>
<LINE>Let him be crown'd; in him your comfort lives:</LINE>
<LINE>Drown desperate sorrow in dead Edward's grave,</LINE>
<LINE>And plant your joys in living Edward's throne.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter GLOUCESTER, BUCKINGHAM, DERBY, HASTINGS, and RATCLIFF</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam, have comfort: all of us have cause</LINE>
<LINE>To wail the dimming of our shining star;</LINE>
<LINE>But none can cure their harms by wailing them.</LINE>
<LINE>Madam, my mother, I do cry you mercy;</LINE>
<LINE>I did not see your grace: humbly on my knee</LINE>
<LINE>I crave your blessing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUCHESS OF YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>God bless thee; and put meekness in thy mind,</LINE>
<LINE>Love, charity, obedience, and true duty!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  Amen; and make me die a good old man!</LINE>
<LINE>That is the butt-end of a mother's blessing:</LINE>
<LINE>I marvel why her grace did leave it out.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BUCKINGHAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You cloudy princes and heart-sorrowing peers,</LINE>
<LINE>That bear this mutual heavy load of moan,</LINE>
<LINE>Now cheer each other in each other's love</LINE>
<LINE>Though we have spent our harvest of this king,</LINE>
<LINE>We are to reap the harvest of his son.</LINE>
<LINE>The broken rancour of your high-swoln hearts,</LINE>
<LINE>But lately splinter'd, knit, and join'd together,</LINE>
<LINE>Must gently be preserved, cherish'd, and kept:</LINE>
<LINE>Me seemeth good, that, with some little train,</LINE>
<LINE>Forthwith from Ludlow the young prince be fetch'd</LINE>
<LINE>Hither to London, to be crown'd our king.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RIVERS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why with some little train, my Lord of Buckingham?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BUCKINGHAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, my lord, lest, by a multitude,</LINE>
<LINE>The new-heal'd wound of malice should break out,</LINE>
<LINE>Which would be so much the more dangerous</LINE>
<LINE>By how much the estate is green and yet ungovern'd:</LINE>
<LINE>Where every horse bears his commanding rein,</LINE>
<LINE>And may direct his course as please himself,</LINE>
<LINE>As well the fear of harm, as harm apparent,</LINE>
<LINE>In my opinion, ought to be prevented.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I hope the king made peace with all of us</LINE>
<LINE>And the compact is firm and true in me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RIVERS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And so in me; and so, I think, in all:</LINE>
<LINE>Yet, since it is but green, it should be put</LINE>
<LINE>To no apparent likelihood of breach,</LINE>
<LINE>Which haply by much company might be urged:</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore I say with noble Buckingham,</LINE>
<LINE>That it is meet so few should fetch the prince.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And so say I.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then be it so; and go we to determine</LINE>
<LINE>Who they shall be that straight shall post to Ludlow.</LINE>
<LINE>Madam, and you, my mother, will you go</LINE>
<LINE>To give your censures in this weighty business?</LINE>

<SPEAKER>BUCKINGHAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, whoever journeys to the Prince,</LINE>
<LINE>For God's sake, let not us two be behind;</LINE>
<LINE>For, by the way, I'll sort occasion,</LINE>
<LINE>As index to the story we late talk'd of,</LINE>
<LINE>To part the queen's proud kindred from the king.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My other self, my counsel's consistory,</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I promise you, I scarcely know myself:</LINE>
<LINE>Hear you the news abroad?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, that the king is dead.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Bad news, by'r lady; seldom comes the better:</LINE>
<LINE>I fear, I fear 'twill prove a troublous world.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter another Citizen</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Third Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Neighbours, God speed!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Give you good morrow, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Third Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Doth this news hold of good King Edward's death?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, sir, it is too true; God help the while!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Third Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then, masters, look to see a troublous world.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, no; by God's good grace his son shall reign.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Third Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Woe to the land that's govern'd by a child!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In him there is a hope of government,</LINE>
<LINE>That in his nonage council under him,</LINE>
<LINE>And in his full and ripen'd years himself,</LINE>
<LINE>No doubt, shall then and till then govern well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So stood the state when Henry the Sixth</LINE>
<LINE>Was crown'd in Paris but at nine months old.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Third Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Stood the state so? No, no, good friends, God wot;</LINE>
<LINE>For then this land was famously enrich'd</LINE>
<LINE>With politic grave counsel; then the king</LINE>
<LINE>Had virtuous uncles to protect his grace.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, so hath this, both by the father and mother.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Third Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Better it were they all came by the father,</LINE>
<LINE>Or by the father there were none at all;</LINE>
<LINE>For emulation now, who shall be nearest,</LINE>
<LINE>Will touch us all too near, if God prevent not.</LINE>
<LINE>O, full of danger is the Duke of Gloucester!</LINE>
<LINE>And the queen's sons and brothers haught and proud:</LINE>
<LINE>And were they to be ruled, and not to rule,</LINE>
<LINE>This sickly land might solace as before.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, come, we fear the worst; all shall be well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Third Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>When clouds appear, wise men put on their cloaks;</LINE>
<LINE>When great leaves fall, the winter is at hand;</LINE>
<LINE>When the sun sets, who doth not look for night?</LINE>
<LINE>Untimely storms make men expect a dearth.</LINE>
<LINE>All may be well; but, if God sort it so,</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis more than we deserve, or I expect.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Truly, the souls of men are full of dread:</LINE>
<LINE>Ye cannot reason almost with a man</LINE>
<LINE>That looks not heavily and full of fear.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Third Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Before the times of change, still is it so:</LINE>
<LINE>By a divine instinct men's minds mistrust</LINE>
<LINE>Ensuing dangers; as by proof, we see</LINE>
<LINE>The waters swell before a boisterous storm.</LINE>
<LINE>But leave it all to God. whither away?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, we were sent for to the justices.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Last night, I hear, they lay at Northampton;</LINE>
<LINE>At Stony-Stratford will they be to-night:</LINE>
<LINE>To-morrow, or next day, they will be here.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUCHESS OF YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I long with all my heart to see the prince:</LINE>
<LINE>I hope he is much grown since last I saw him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN ELIZABETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But I hear, no; they say my son of York</LINE>
<LINE>Hath almost overta'en him in his growth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, mother; but I would not have it so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUCHESS OF YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, my young cousin, it is good to grow.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Grandam, one night, as we did sit at supper,</LINE>
<LINE>My uncle Rivers talk'd how I did grow</LINE>
<LINE>More than my brother: 'Ay,' quoth my uncle</LINE>
<LINE>Gloucester,</LINE>
<LINE>'Small herbs have grace, great weeds do grow apace:'</LINE>
<LINE>And since, methinks, I would not grow so fast,</LINE>
<LINE>Because sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUCHESS OF YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good faith, good faith, the saying did not hold</LINE>
<LINE>In him that did object the same to thee;</LINE>
<LINE>He was the wretched'st thing when he was young,</LINE>
<LINE>So long a-growing and so leisurely,</LINE>
<LINE>That, if this rule were true, he should be gracious.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, madam, so, no doubt, he is.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUCHESS OF YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I hope he is; but yet let mothers doubt.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, by my troth, if I had been remember'd,</LINE>
<LINE>I could have given my uncle's grace a flout,</LINE>
<LINE>To touch his growth nearer than he touch'd mine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUCHESS OF YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How, my pretty York? I pray thee, let me hear it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, they say my uncle grew so fast</LINE>
<LINE>That he could gnaw a crust at two hours old</LINE>
<LINE>'Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth.</LINE>
<LINE>Grandam, this would have been a biting jest.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUCHESS OF YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I pray thee, pretty York, who told thee this?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Grandam, his nurse.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUCHESS OF YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>His nurse! why, she was dead ere thou wert born.</LINE>

<LINE>Welcome, destruction, death, and massacre!</LINE>
<LINE>I see, as in a map, the end of all.</LINE>

<LINE>Accursed and unquiet wrangling days,</LINE>

<LINE>My husband lost his life to get the crown;</LINE>
<LINE>And often up and down my sons were toss'd,</LINE>
<LINE>For me to joy and weep their gain and loss:</LINE>
<LINE>And being seated, and domestic broils</LINE>
<LINE>Clean over-blown, themselves, the conquerors.</LINE>
<LINE>Make war upon themselves; blood against blood,</LINE>
<LINE>Self against self: O, preposterous</LINE>
<LINE>And frantic outrage, end thy damned spleen;</LINE>
<LINE>Or let me die, to look on death no more!</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Welcome, dear cousin, my thoughts' sovereign</LINE>
<LINE>The weary way hath made you melancholy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE EDWARD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, uncle; but our crosses on the way</LINE>
<LINE>Have made it tedious, wearisome, and heavy</LINE>
<LINE>I want more uncles here to welcome me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sweet prince, the untainted virtue of your years</LINE>
<LINE>Hath not yet dived into the world's deceit</LINE>
<LINE>Nor more can you distinguish of a man</LINE>
<LINE>Than of his outward show; which, God he knows,</LINE>
<LINE>Seldom or never jumpeth with the heart.</LINE>
<LINE>Those uncles which you want were dangerous;</LINE>
<LINE>Your grace attended to their sugar'd words,</LINE>
<LINE>But look'd not on the poison of their hearts :</LINE>
<LINE>God keep you from them, and from such false friends!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEAKER>PRINCE EDWARD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>God keep me from false friends! but they were none.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>On what occasion, God he knows, not I,</LINE>
<LINE>The queen your mother, and your brother York,</LINE>

<LINE>Would fain have come with me to meet your grace,</LINE>
<LINE>But by his mother was perforce withheld.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BUCKINGHAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fie, what an indirect and peevish course</LINE>
<LINE>Is this of hers! Lord cardinal, will your grace</LINE>
<LINE>Persuade the queen to send the Duke of York</LINE>
<LINE>Unto his princely brother presently?</LINE>
<LINE>If she deny, Lord Hastings, go with him,</LINE>
<LINE>And from her jealous arms pluck him perforce.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CARDINAL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My Lord of Buckingham, if my weak oratory</LINE>
<LINE>Can from his mother win the Duke of York,</LINE>
<LINE>Anon expect him here; but if she be obdurate</LINE>
<LINE>To mild entreaties, God in heaven forbid</LINE>
<LINE>We should infringe the holy privilege</LINE>
<LINE>Of blessed sanctuary! not for all this land</LINE>
<LINE>Would I be guilty of so deep a sin.</LINE>

<LINE>You are too senseless--obstinate, my lord,</LINE>
<LINE>Too ceremonious and traditional</LINE>
<LINE>Weigh it but with the grossness of this age,</LINE>
<LINE>You break not sanctuary in seizing him.</LINE>
<LINE>The benefit thereof is always granted</LINE>
<LINE>To those whose dealings have deserved the place,</LINE>
<LINE>And those who have the wit to claim the place:</LINE>
<LINE>This prince hath neither claim'd it nor deserved it;</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore, in mine opinion, cannot have it:</LINE>
<LINE>Then, taking him from thence that is not there,</LINE>
<LINE>You break no privilege nor charter there.</LINE>
<LINE>Oft have I heard of sanctuary men;</LINE>
<LINE>But sanctuary children ne'er till now.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CARDINAL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, you shall o'er-rule my mind for once.</LINE>
<LINE>Come on, Lord Hastings, will you go with me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I go, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE EDWARD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good lords, make all the speedy haste you may.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exeunt CARDINAL and HASTINGS</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Say, uncle Gloucester, if our brother come,</LINE>
<LINE>Where shall we sojourn till our coronation?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where it seems best unto your royal self.</LINE>
<LINE>If I may counsel you, some day or two</LINE>
<LINE>Your highness shall repose you at the Tower:</LINE>
<LINE>Then where you please, and shall be thought most fit</LINE>
<LINE>For your best health and recreation.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE EDWARD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do not like the Tower, of any place.</LINE>
<LINE>Did Julius Caesar build that place, my lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BUCKINGHAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He did, my gracious lord, begin that place;</LINE>
<LINE>Which, since, succeeding ages have re-edified.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE EDWARD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is it upon record, or else reported</LINE>
<LINE>Successively from age to age, he built it?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BUCKINGHAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Upon record, my gracious lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE EDWARD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But say, my lord, it were not register'd,</LINE>
<LINE>Methinks the truth should live from age to age,</LINE>
<LINE>As 'twere retail'd to all posterity,</LINE>
<LINE>Even to the general all-ending day.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  So wise so young, they say, do never</LINE>
<LINE>live long.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE EDWARD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What say you, uncle?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I say, without characters, fame lives long.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Thus, like the formal vice, Iniquity,</LINE>
<LINE>I moralize two meanings in one word.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE EDWARD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That Julius Caesar was a famous man;</LINE>
<LINE>With what his valour did enrich his wit,</LINE>
<LINE>His wit set down to make his valour live</LINE>
<LINE>Death makes no conquest of this conqueror;</LINE>
<LINE>For now he lives in fame, though not in life.</LINE>
<LINE>I'll tell you what, my cousin Buckingham,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BUCKINGHAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, my gracious lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE EDWARD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>An if I live until I be a man,</LINE>
<LINE>I'll win our ancient right in France again,</LINE>
<LINE>Or die a soldier, as I lived a king.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  Short summers lightly have a forward spring.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter young YORK, HASTINGS, and the CARDINAL</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BUCKINGHAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, in good time, here comes the Duke of York.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE EDWARD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Richard of York! how fares our loving brother?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, my dread lord; so must I call you now.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE EDWARD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, brother, to our grief, as it is yours:</LINE>
<LINE>Too late he died that might have kept that title,</LINE>
<LINE>Which by his death hath lost much majesty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How fares our cousin, noble Lord of York?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I thank you, gentle uncle. O, my lord,</LINE>
<LINE>You said that idle weeds are fast in growth</LINE>
<LINE>The prince my brother hath outgrown me far.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He hath, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And therefore is he idle?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, my fair cousin, I must not say so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then is he more beholding to you than I.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He may command me as my sovereign;</LINE>
<LINE>But you have power in me as in a kinsman.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I pray you, uncle, give me this dagger.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My dagger, little cousin? with all my heart.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE EDWARD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A beggar, brother?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Of my kind uncle, that I know will give;</LINE>
<LINE>And being but a toy, which is no grief to give.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A greater gift than that I'll give my cousin.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A greater gift! O, that's the sword to it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A gentle cousin, were it light enough.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, then, I see, you will part but with light gifts;</LINE>
<LINE>In weightier things you'll say a beggar nay.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is too heavy for your grace to wear.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I weigh it lightly, were it heavier.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, would you have my weapon, little lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would, that I might thank you as you call me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Little.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE EDWARD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My Lord of York will still be cross in talk:</LINE>
<LINE>Uncle, your grace knows how to bear with him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You mean, to bear me, not to bear with me:</LINE>
<LINE>Uncle, my brother mocks both you and me;</LINE>
<LINE>Because that I am little, like an ape,</LINE>
<LINE>He thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BUCKINGHAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With what a sharp-provided wit he reasons!</LINE>
<LINE>To mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle,</LINE>
<LINE>He prettily and aptly taunts himself:</LINE>
<LINE>So cunning and so young is wonderful.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, will't please you pass along?</LINE>
<LINE>Myself and my good cousin Buckingham</LINE>
<LINE>Will to your mother, to entreat of her</LINE>
<LINE>To meet you at the Tower and welcome you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, will you go unto the Tower, my lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE EDWARD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord protector needs will have it so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, what should you fear?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, my uncle Clarence' angry ghost:</LINE>
<LINE>My grandam told me he was murdered there.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE EDWARD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I fear no uncles dead.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nor none that live, I hope.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE EDWARD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>An if they live, I hope I need not fear.</LINE>
<LINE>But come, my lord; and with a heavy heart,</LINE>
<LINE>Thinking on them, go I unto the Tower.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>A Sennet. Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER, BUCKINGHAM
and CATESBY</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BUCKINGHAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Think you, my lord, this little prating York</LINE>
<LINE>Was not incensed by his subtle mother</LINE>
<LINE>To taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No doubt, no doubt; O, 'tis a parlous boy;</LINE>
<LINE>Bold, quick, ingenious, forward, capable</LINE>
<LINE>He is all the mother's, from the top to toe.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BUCKINGHAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, let them rest. Come hither, Catesby.</LINE>
<LINE>Thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend</LINE>
<LINE>As closely to conceal what we impart:</LINE>
<LINE>Thou know'st our reasons urged upon the way;</LINE>
<LINE>What think'st thou? is it not an easy matter</LINE>
<LINE>To make William Lord Hastings of our mind,</LINE>
<LINE>For the instalment of this noble duke</LINE>
<LINE>In the seat royal of this famous isle?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CATESBY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He for his father's sake so loves the prince,</LINE>
<LINE>That he will not be won to aught against him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BUCKINGHAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What think'st thou, then, of Stanley? what will he?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CATESBY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He will do all in all as Hastings doth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BUCKINGHAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, then, no more but this: go, gentle Catesby,</LINE>
<LINE>And, as it were far off sound thou Lord Hastings,</LINE>
<LINE>How doth he stand affected to our purpose;</LINE>
<LINE>And summon him to-morrow to the Tower,</LINE>
<LINE>To sit about the coronation.</LINE>
<LINE>If thou dost find him tractable to us,</LINE>
<LINE>Encourage him, and show him all our reasons:</LINE>
<LINE>If he be leaden, icy-cold, unwilling,</LINE>
<LINE>Be thou so too; and so break off your talk,</LINE>
<LINE>And give us notice of his inclination:</LINE>
<LINE>For we to-morrow hold divided councils,</LINE>
<LINE>Wherein thyself shalt highly be employ'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Commend me to Lord William: tell him, Catesby,</LINE>
<LINE>His ancient knot of dangerous adversaries</LINE>
<LINE>To-morrow are let blood at Pomfret-castle;</LINE>
<LINE>And bid my friend, for joy of this good news,</LINE>
<LINE>Give mistress Shore one gentle kiss the more.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BUCKINGHAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good Catesby, go, effect this business soundly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CATESBY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My good lords both, with all the heed I may.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Shall we hear from you, Catesby, ere we sleep?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CATESBY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You shall, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>At Crosby Place, there shall you find us both.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit CATESBY</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BUCKINGHAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, my lord, what shall we do, if we perceive</LINE>
<LINE>Lord Hastings will not yield to our complots?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Chop off his head, man; somewhat we will do:</LINE>
<LINE>And, look, when I am king, claim thou of me</LINE>
<LINE>The earldom of Hereford, and the moveables</LINE>
<LINE>Whereof the king my brother stood possess'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BUCKINGHAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll claim that promise at your grace's hands.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And look to have it yielded with all willingness.</LINE>
<LINE>Come, let us sup betimes, that afterwards</LINE>
<LINE>We may digest our complots in some form.</LINE>

<LINE>What, ho! my lord!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Within</STAGEDIR>  Who knocks at the door?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A messenger from the Lord Stanley.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter HASTINGS</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What is't o'clock?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Upon the stroke of four.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Cannot thy master sleep these tedious nights?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So it should seem by that I have to say.</LINE>
<LINE>First, he commends him to your noble lordship.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And then?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And then he sends you word</LINE>
<LINE>He dreamt to-night the boar had razed his helm:</LINE>
<LINE>Besides, he says there are two councils held;</LINE>
<LINE>And that may be determined at the one</LINE>
<LINE>which may make you and him to rue at the other.</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore he sends to know your lordship's pleasure,</LINE>
<LINE>If presently you will take horse with him,</LINE>
<LINE>And with all speed post with him toward the north,</LINE>
<LINE>To shun the danger that his soul divines.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go, fellow, go, return unto thy lord;</LINE>
<LINE>Bid him not fear the separated councils</LINE>
<LINE>His honour and myself are at the one,</LINE>
<LINE>And at the other is my servant Catesby</LINE>
<LINE>Where nothing can proceed that toucheth us</LINE>
<LINE>Whereof I shall not have intelligence.</LINE>
<LINE>Tell him his fears are shallow, wanting instance:</LINE>
<LINE>And for his dreams, I wonder he is so fond</LINE>
<LINE>To trust the mockery of unquiet slumbers</LINE>
<LINE>To fly the boar before the boar pursues,</LINE>
<LINE>Were to incense the boar to follow us</LINE>
<LINE>And make pursuit where he did mean no chase.</LINE>
<LINE>Go, bid thy master rise and come to me</LINE>
<LINE>And we will both together to the Tower,</LINE>
<LINE>Where, he shall see, the boar will use us kindly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My gracious lord, I'll tell him what you say.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CATESBY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Many good morrows to my noble lord!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good morrow, Catesby; you are early stirring</LINE>
<LINE>What news, what news, in this our tottering state?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CATESBY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is a reeling world, indeed, my lord;</LINE>
<LINE>And I believe twill never stand upright</LINE>
<LINE>Tim Richard wear the garland of the realm.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How! wear the garland! dost thou mean the crown?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CATESBY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, my good lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders</LINE>
<LINE>Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.</LINE>
<LINE>But canst thou guess that he doth aim at it?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CATESBY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, on my life; and hopes to find forward</LINE>
<LINE>Upon his party for the gain thereof:</LINE>
<LINE>And thereupon he sends you this good news,</LINE>
<LINE>That this same very day your enemies,</LINE>
<LINE>The kindred of the queen, must die at Pomfret.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Indeed, I am no mourner for that news,</LINE>
<LINE>Because they have been still mine enemies:</LINE>
<LINE>But, that I'll give my voice on Richard's side,</LINE>
<LINE>To bar my master's heirs in true descent,</LINE>
<LINE>God knows I will not do it, to the death.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CATESBY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>God keep your lordship in that gracious mind!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But I shall laugh at this a twelve-month hence,</LINE>
<LINE>That they who brought me in my master's hate</LINE>
<LINE>I live to look upon their tragedy.</LINE>
<LINE>I tell thee, Catesby--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CATESBY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, my lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ere a fortnight make me elder,</LINE>
<LINE>I'll send some packing that yet think not on it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CATESBY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis a vile thing to die, my gracious lord,</LINE>
<LINE>When men are unprepared and look not for it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O monstrous, monstrous! and so falls it out</LINE>
<LINE>With Rivers, Vaughan, Grey: and so 'twill do</LINE>
<LINE>With some men else, who think themselves as safe</LINE>
<LINE>As thou and I; who, as thou know'st, are dear</LINE>
<LINE>To princely Richard and to Buckingham.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>STANLEY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, good morrow; good morrow, Catesby:</LINE>
<LINE>You may jest on, but, by the holy rood,</LINE>
<LINE>I do not like these several councils, I.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord,</LINE>
<LINE>I hold my life as dear as you do yours;</LINE>
<LINE>And never in my life, I do protest,</LINE>
<LINE>Was it more precious to me than 'tis now:</LINE>
<LINE>Think you, but that I know our state secure,</LINE>
<LINE>I would be so triumphant as I am?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>STANLEY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The lords at Pomfret, when they rode from London,</LINE>
<LINE>Were jocund, and supposed their state was sure,</LINE>
<LINE>And they indeed had no cause to mistrust;</LINE>
<LINE>But yet, you see how soon the day o'ercast.</LINE>
<LINE>This sudden stag of rancour I misdoubt:</LINE>
<LINE>Pray God, I say, I prove a needless coward!</LINE>
<LINE>What, shall we toward the Tower? the day is spent.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, come, have with you. Wot you what, my lord?</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I tell thee, man, 'tis better with me now</LINE>
<LINE>Than when I met thee last where now we meet:</LINE>
<LINE>Then was I going prisoner to the Tower,</LINE>
<LINE>By the suggestion of the queen's allies;</LINE>
<LINE>But now, I tell thee--keep it to thyself--</LINE>
<LINE>This day those enemies are put to death,</LINE>
<LINE>And I in better state than e'er I was.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good faith, and when I met this holy man,</LINE>

<LINE>O Pomfret, Pomfret! O thou bloody prison,</LINE>
<LINE>Fatal and ominous to noble peers!</LINE>
<LINE>Within the guilty closure of thy walls</LINE>
<LINE>Richard the second here was hack'd to death;</LINE>
<LINE>And, for more slander to thy dismal seat,</LINE>
<LINE>We give thee up our guiltless blood to drink.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>HASTINGS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lords, at once: the cause why we are met</LINE>
<LINE>Is, to determine of the coronation.</LINE>
<LINE>In God's name, speak: when is the royal day?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BUCKINGHAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Are all things fitting for that royal time?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DERBY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is, and wants but nomination.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BISHOP OF ELY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To-morrow, then, I judge a happy day.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BUCKINGHAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who knows the lord protector's mind herein?</LINE>
<LINE>Who is most inward with the royal duke?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BISHOP OF ELY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your grace, we think, should soonest know his mind.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BUCKINGHAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who, I, my lord I we know each other's faces,</LINE>
<LINE>But for our hearts, he knows no more of mine,</LINE>
<LINE>Than I of yours;</LINE>
<LINE>Nor I no more of his, than you of mine.</LINE>
<LINE>Lord Hastings, you and he are near in love.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I thank his grace, I know he loves me well;</LINE>
<LINE>But, for his purpose in the coronation.</LINE>
<LINE>I have not sounded him, nor he deliver'd</LINE>
<LINE>His gracious pleasure any way therein:</LINE>
<LINE>But you, my noble lords, may name the time;</LINE>
<LINE>And in the duke's behalf I'll give my voice,</LINE>
<LINE>Which, I presume, he'll take in gentle part.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter GLOUCESTER</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My noble lords and cousins all, good morrow.</LINE>
<LINE>I have been long a sleeper; but, I hope,</LINE>
<LINE>My absence doth neglect no great designs,</LINE>
<LINE>Which by my presence might have been concluded.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BUCKINGHAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Had not you come upon your cue, my lord</LINE>
<LINE>William Lord Hastings had pronounced your part,--</LINE>
<LINE>I mean, your voice,--for crowning of the king.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Than my Lord Hastings no man might be bolder;</LINE>

<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Cousin of Buckingham, a word with you.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Drawing him aside</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Catesby hath sounded Hastings in our business,</LINE>
<LINE>And finds the testy gentleman so hot,</LINE>
<LINE>As he will lose his head ere give consent</LINE>
<LINE>His master's son, as worshipful as he terms it,</LINE>
<LINE>Shall lose the royalty of England's throne.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DERBY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We have not yet set down this day of triumph.</LINE>
<LINE>To-morrow, in mine opinion, is too sudden;</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>His grace looks cheerfully and smooth to-day;</LINE>
<LINE>There's some conceit or other likes him well,</LINE>
<LINE>When he doth bid good morrow with such a spirit.</LINE>
<LINE>I think there's never a man in Christendom</LINE>
<LINE>That can less hide his love or hate than he;</LINE>
<LINE>For by his face straight shall you know his heart.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DERBY</SPEAKER>

<LINE>By any likelihood he show'd to-day?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, that with no man here he is offended;</LINE>
<LINE>For, were he, he had shown it in his looks.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I pray you all, tell me what they deserve</LINE>
<LINE>That do conspire my death with devilish plots</LINE>
<LINE>Of damned witchcraft, and that have prevail'd</LINE>
<LINE>Upon my body with their hellish charms?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The tender love I bear your grace, my lord,</LINE>
<LINE>Makes me most forward in this noble presence</LINE>
<LINE>To doom the offenders, whatsoever they be</LINE>
<LINE>I say, my lord, they have deserved death.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then be your eyes the witness of this ill:</LINE>
<LINE>See how I am bewitch'd; behold mine arm</LINE>
<LINE>Is, like a blasted sapling, wither'd up:</LINE>
<LINE>And this is Edward's wife, that monstrous witch,</LINE>
<LINE>Consorted with that harlot strumpet Shore,</LINE>
<LINE>That by their witchcraft thus have marked me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If they have done this thing, my gracious lord--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If I thou protector of this damned strumpet--</LINE>
<LINE>Tellest thou me of 'ifs'?  Thou art a traitor:</LINE>
<LINE>Off with his head! Now, by Saint Paul I swear,</LINE>
<LINE>I will not dine until I see the same.</LINE>
<LINE>Lovel and Ratcliff, look that it be done:</LINE>
<LINE>The rest, that love me, rise and follow me.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Woe, woe for England! not a whit for me;</LINE>
<LINE>For I, too fond, might have prevented this.</LINE>
<LINE>Stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm;</LINE>
<LINE>But I disdain'd it, and did scorn to fly:</LINE>
<LINE>Three times to-day my foot-cloth horse did stumble,</LINE>
<LINE>And startled, when he look'd upon the Tower,</LINE>
<LINE>As loath to bear me to the slaughter-house.</LINE>
<LINE>O, now I want the priest that spake to me:</LINE>
<LINE>I now repent I told the pursuivant</LINE>
<LINE>As 'twere triumphing at mine enemies,</LINE>
<LINE>How they at Pomfret bloodily were butcher'd,</LINE>
<LINE>And I myself secure in grace and favour.</LINE>
<LINE>O Margaret, Margaret, now thy heavy curse</LINE>
<LINE>Is lighted on poor Hastings' wretched head!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RATCLIFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Dispatch, my lord; the duke would be at dinner:</LINE>
<LINE>Make a short shrift; he longs to see your head.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O momentary grace of mortal men,</LINE>
<LINE>Which we more hunt for than the grace of God!</LINE>
<LINE>Who builds his hopes in air of your good looks,</LINE>
<LINE>Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast,</LINE>
<LINE>Ready, with every nod, to tumble down</LINE>
<LINE>Into the fatal bowels of the deep.</LINE>

<LINE>Murder thy breath in the middle of a word,</LINE>
<LINE>And then begin again, and stop again,</LINE>
<LINE>As if thou wert distraught and mad with terror?</LINE>

<LINE>Tut, I can counterfeit the deep tragedian;</LINE>
<LINE>Speak and look back, and pry on every side,</LINE>
<LINE>Tremble and start at wagging of a straw,</LINE>
<LINE>Intending deep suspicion: ghastly looks</LINE>
<LINE>Are at my service, like enforced smiles;</LINE>

<SPEAKER>LOVEL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here is the head of that ignoble traitor,</LINE>
<LINE>The dangerous and unsuspected Hastings.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So dear I loved the man, that I must weep.</LINE>
<LINE>I took him for the plainest harmless creature</LINE>
<LINE>That breathed upon this earth a Christian;</LINE>
<LINE>Made him my book wherein my soul recorded</LINE>
<LINE>The history of all her secret thoughts:</LINE>
<LINE>So smooth he daub'd his vice with show of virtue,</LINE>
<LINE>That, his apparent open guilt omitted,</LINE>
<LINE>I mean, his conversation with Shore's wife,</LINE>
<LINE>He lived from all attainder of suspect.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BUCKINGHAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, well, he was the covert'st shelter'd traitor</LINE>
<LINE>That ever lived.</LINE>
<LINE>Would you imagine, or almost believe,</LINE>
<LINE>Were't not that, by great preservation,</LINE>
<LINE>We live to tell it you, the subtle traitor</LINE>
<LINE>This day had plotted, in the council-house</LINE>
<LINE>To murder me and my good Lord of Gloucester?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Lord Mayor</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, had he so?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, think You we are Turks or infidels?</LINE>
<LINE>Or that we would, against the form of law,</LINE>
<LINE>Proceed thus rashly to the villain's death,</LINE>
<LINE>But that the extreme peril of the case,</LINE>
<LINE>The peace of England and our persons' safety,</LINE>
<LINE>Enforced us to this execution?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Lord Mayor</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, fair befall you! he deserved his death;</LINE>
<LINE>And you my good lords, both have well proceeded,</LINE>
<LINE>To warn false traitors from the like attempts.</LINE>
<LINE>I never look'd for better at his hands,</LINE>
<LINE>After he once fell in with Mistress Shore.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yet had not we determined he should die,</LINE>
<LINE>Until your lordship came to see his death;</LINE>
<LINE>Which now the loving haste of these our friends,</LINE>
<LINE>Somewhat against our meaning, have prevented:</LINE>
<LINE>Because, my lord, we would have had you heard</LINE>
<LINE>The traitor speak, and timorously confess</LINE>
<LINE>The manner and the purpose of his treason;</LINE>
<LINE>That you might well have signified the same</LINE>
<LINE>Unto the citizens, who haply may</LINE>
<LINE>Misconstrue us in him and wail his death.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Lord Mayor</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But, my good lord, your grace's word shall serve,</LINE>
<LINE>As well as I had seen and heard him speak</LINE>
<LINE>And doubt you not, right noble princes both,</LINE>
<LINE>But I'll acquaint our duteous citizens</LINE>
<LINE>With all your just proceedings in this cause.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And to that end we wish'd your lord-ship here,</LINE>
<LINE>To avoid the carping censures of the world.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BUCKINGHAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But since you come too late of our intents,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet witness what you hear we did intend:</LINE>
<LINE>And so, my good lord mayor, we bid farewell.</LINE>

<LINE>The mayor towards Guildhall hies him in all post:</LINE>
<LINE>There, at your meet'st advantage of the time,</LINE>
<LINE>Infer the bastardy of Edward's children:</LINE>
<LINE>Tell them how Edward put to death a citizen,</LINE>
<LINE>Only for saying he would make his son</LINE>
<LINE>Heir to the crown; meaning indeed his house,</LINE>
<LINE>Which, by the sign thereof was termed so.</LINE>
<LINE>Moreover, urge his hateful luxury</LINE>
<LINE>And bestial appetite in change of lust;</LINE>
<LINE>Which stretched to their servants, daughters, wives,</LINE>
<LINE>Even where his lustful eye or savage heart,</LINE>
<LINE>Without control, listed to make his prey.</LINE>
<LINE>Nay, for a need, thus far come near my person:</LINE>
<LINE>Tell them, when that my mother went with child</LINE>
<LINE>Of that unsatiate Edward, noble York</LINE>
<LINE>My princely father then had wars in France</LINE>
<LINE>And, by just computation of the time,</LINE>
<LINE>Found that the issue was not his begot;</LINE>
<LINE>Which well appeared in his lineaments,</LINE>
<LINE>Being nothing like the noble duke my father:</LINE>
<LINE>But touch this sparingly, as 'twere far off,</LINE>
<LINE>Because you know, my lord, my mother lives.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BUCKINGHAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fear not, my lord, I'll play the orator</LINE>
<LINE>As if the golden fee for which I plead</LINE>

<SPEAKER>Scrivener</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is the indictment of the good Lord Hastings;</LINE>
<LINE>Which in a set hand fairly is engross'd,</LINE>
<LINE>That it may be this day read over in Paul's.</LINE>
<LINE>And mark how well the sequel hangs together:</LINE>
<LINE>Eleven hours I spent to write it over,</LINE>
<LINE>For yesternight by Catesby was it brought me;</LINE>
<LINE>The precedent was full as long a-doing:</LINE>
<LINE>And yet within these five hours lived Lord Hastings,</LINE>
<LINE>Untainted, unexamined, free, at liberty</LINE>
<LINE>Here's a good world the while! Why who's so gross,</LINE>
<LINE>That seeth not this palpable device?</LINE>
<LINE>Yet who's so blind, but says he sees it not?</LINE>
<LINE>Bad is the world; and all will come to nought,</LINE>

<LINE>How now, my lord, what say the citizens?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BUCKINGHAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, by the holy mother of our Lord,</LINE>
<LINE>The citizens are mum and speak not a word.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Touch'd you the bastardy of Edward's children?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BUCKINGHAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I did; with his contract with Lady Lucy,</LINE>
<LINE>And his contract by deputy in France;</LINE>
<LINE>The insatiate greediness of his desires,</LINE>
<LINE>And his enforcement of the city wives;</LINE>
<LINE>His tyranny for trifles; his own bastardy,</LINE>
<LINE>As being got, your father then in France,</LINE>
<LINE>His resemblance, being not like the duke;</LINE>
<LINE>Withal I did infer your lineaments,</LINE>
<LINE>Being the right idea of your father,</LINE>
<LINE>Both in your form and nobleness of mind;</LINE>
<LINE>Laid open all your victories in Scotland,</LINE>
<LINE>Your dicipline in war, wisdom in peace,</LINE>
<LINE>Your bounty, virtue, fair humility:</LINE>
<LINE>Indeed, left nothing fitting for the purpose</LINE>
<LINE>Untouch'd, or slightly handled, in discourse</LINE>
<LINE>And when mine oratory grew to an end</LINE>
<LINE>I bid them that did love their country's good</LINE>
<LINE>Cry 'God save Richard, England's royal king!'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ah! and did they so?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BUCKINGHAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, so God help me, they spake not a word;</LINE>
<LINE>But, like dumb statues or breathing stones,</LINE>
<LINE>Gazed each on other, and look'd deadly pale.</LINE>
<LINE>Which when I saw, I reprehended them;</LINE>
<LINE>And ask'd the mayor what meant this wilful silence:</LINE>
<LINE>His answer was, the people were not wont</LINE>
<LINE>To be spoke to but by the recorder.</LINE>
<LINE>Then he was urged to tell my tale again,</LINE>
<LINE>'Thus saith the duke, thus hath the duke inferr'd;'</LINE>
<LINE>But nothing spake in warrant from himself.</LINE>
<LINE>When he had done, some followers of mine own,</LINE>
<LINE>At the lower end of the hall, hurl'd up their caps,</LINE>
<LINE>And some ten voices cried 'God save King Richard!'</LINE>
<LINE>And thus I took the vantage of those few,</LINE>
<LINE>'Thanks, gentle citizens and friends,' quoth I;</LINE>
<LINE>'This general applause and loving shout</LINE>
<LINE>Argues your wisdoms and your love to Richard:'</LINE>
<LINE>And even here brake off, and came away.</LINE>

<LINE>And stand betwixt two churchmen, good my lord;</LINE>
<LINE>For on that ground I'll build a holy descant:</LINE>
<LINE>And be not easily won to our request:</LINE>
<LINE>Play the maid's part, still answer nay, and take it.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter CATESBY</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Here comes his servant: how now, Catesby,</LINE>
<LINE>What says he?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CATESBY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord: he doth entreat your grace;</LINE>
<LINE>To visit him to-morrow or next day:</LINE>
<LINE>He is within, with two right reverend fathers,</LINE>
<LINE>Divinely bent to meditation;</LINE>
<LINE>And no worldly suit would he be moved,</LINE>
<LINE>To draw him from his holy exercise.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BUCKINGHAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Return, good Catesby, to thy lord again;</LINE>
<LINE>Tell him, myself, the mayor and citizens,</LINE>
<LINE>In deep designs and matters of great moment,</LINE>
<LINE>No less importing than our general good,</LINE>
<LINE>Are come to have some conference with his grace.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CATESBY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll tell him what you say, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BUCKINGHAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ah, ha, my lord, this prince is not an Edward!</LINE>
<LINE>He is not lolling on a lewd day-bed,</LINE>
<LINE>But on his knees at meditation;</LINE>
<LINE>Not dallying with a brace of courtezans,</LINE>
<LINE>But meditating with two deep divines;</LINE>
<LINE>Not sleeping, to engross his idle body,</LINE>
<LINE>But praying, to enrich his watchful soul:</LINE>
<LINE>Happy were England, would this gracious prince</LINE>
<LINE>Take on himself the sovereignty thereof:</LINE>
<LINE>But, sure, I fear, we shall ne'er win him to it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Lord Mayor</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, God forbid his grace should say us nay!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BUCKINGHAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I fear he will.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Re-enter CATESBY</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>How now, Catesby, what says your lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CATESBY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord,</LINE>
<LINE>He wonders to what end you have assembled</LINE>
<LINE>Such troops of citizens to speak with him,</LINE>
<LINE>His grace not being warn'd thereof before:</LINE>
<LINE>My lord, he fears you mean no good to him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BUCKINGHAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sorry I am my noble cousin should</LINE>
<LINE>Suspect me, that I mean no good to him:</LINE>
<LINE>By heaven, I come in perfect love to him;</LINE>
<LINE>And so once more return and tell his grace.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit CATESBY</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>When holy and devout religious men</LINE>
<LINE>Are at their beads, 'tis hard to draw them thence,</LINE>
<LINE>So sweet is zealous contemplation.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter GLOUCESTER aloft, between two Bishops.
CATESBY returns</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Lord Mayor</SPEAKER>
<LINE>See, where he stands between two clergymen!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BUCKINGHAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Two props of virtue for a Christian prince,</LINE>
<LINE>To stay him from the fall of vanity:</LINE>
<LINE>And, see, a book of prayer in his hand,</LINE>
<LINE>True ornaments to know a holy man.</LINE>
<LINE>Famous Plantagenet, most gracious prince,</LINE>
<LINE>Lend favourable ears to our request;</LINE>
<LINE>And pardon us the interruption</LINE>
<LINE>Of thy devotion and right Christian zeal.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, there needs no such apology:</LINE>
<LINE>I rather do beseech you pardon me,</LINE>
<LINE>Who, earnest in the service of my God,</LINE>
<LINE>Neglect the visitation of my friends.</LINE>
<LINE>But, leaving this, what is your grace's pleasure?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BUCKINGHAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Even that, I hope, which pleaseth God above,</LINE>
<LINE>And all good men of this ungovern'd isle.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do suspect I have done some offence</LINE>
<LINE>That seems disgracious in the city's eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>And that you come to reprehend my ignorance.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BUCKINGHAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You have, my lord: would it might please your grace,</LINE>
<LINE>At our entreaties, to amend that fault!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Else wherefore breathe I in a Christian land?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BUCKINGHAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then know, it is your fault that you resign</LINE>
<LINE>The supreme seat, the throne majestical,</LINE>
<LINE>The scepter'd office of your ancestors,</LINE>
<LINE>Your state of fortune and your due of birth,</LINE>
<LINE>The lineal glory of your royal house,</LINE>
<LINE>To the corruption of a blemished stock:</LINE>
<LINE>Whilst, in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts,</LINE>
<LINE>Which here we waken to our country's good,</LINE>
<LINE>This noble isle doth want her proper limbs;</LINE>
<LINE>Her face defaced with scars of infamy,</LINE>
<LINE>Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants,</LINE>
<LINE>And almost shoulder'd in the swallowing gulf</LINE>
<LINE>Of blind forgetfulness and dark oblivion.</LINE>
<LINE>Which to recure, we heartily solicit</LINE>
<LINE>Your gracious self to take on you the charge</LINE>
<LINE>And kingly government of this your land,</LINE>
<LINE>Not as protector, steward, substitute,</LINE>
<LINE>Or lowly factor for another's gain;</LINE>
<LINE>But as successively from blood to blood,</LINE>
<LINE>Your right of birth, your empery, your own.</LINE>
<LINE>For this, consorted with the citizens,</LINE>
<LINE>Your very worshipful and loving friends,</LINE>
<LINE>And by their vehement instigation,</LINE>
<LINE>In this just suit come I to move your grace.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know not whether to depart in silence,</LINE>
<LINE>Or bitterly to speak in your reproof.</LINE>
<LINE>Best fitteth my degree or your condition</LINE>
<LINE>If not to answer, you might haply think</LINE>
<LINE>Tongue-tied ambition, not replying, yielded</LINE>
<LINE>To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty,</LINE>
<LINE>Which fondly you would here impose on me;</LINE>
<LINE>If to reprove you for this suit of yours,</LINE>
<LINE>So season'd with your faithful love to me.</LINE>
<LINE>Then, on the other side, I cheque'd my friends.</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore, to speak, and to avoid the first,</LINE>
<LINE>And then, in speaking, not to incur the last,</LINE>
<LINE>Definitively thus I answer you.</LINE>
<LINE>Your love deserves my thanks; but my desert</LINE>
<LINE>Unmeritable shuns your high request.</LINE>
<LINE>First if all obstacles were cut away,</LINE>
<LINE>And that my path were even to the crown,</LINE>
<LINE>As my ripe revenue and due by birth</LINE>
<LINE>Yet so much is my poverty of spirit,</LINE>
<LINE>So mighty and so many my defects,</LINE>
<LINE>As I had rather hide me from my greatness,</LINE>
<LINE>Being a bark to brook no mighty sea,</LINE>
<LINE>Than in my greatness covet to be hid,</LINE>
<LINE>And in the vapour of my glory smother'd.</LINE>
<LINE>But, God be thank'd, there's no need of me,</LINE>
<LINE>And much I need to help you, if need were;</LINE>
<LINE>The royal tree hath left us royal fruit,</LINE>
<LINE>Which, mellow'd by the stealing hours of time,</LINE>
<LINE>Will well become the seat of majesty,</LINE>
<LINE>And make, no doubt, us happy by his reign.</LINE>
<LINE>On him I lay what you would lay on me,</LINE>
<LINE>The right and fortune of his happy stars;</LINE>
<LINE>Which God defend that I should wring from him!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BUCKINGHAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, this argues conscience in your grace;</LINE>
<LINE>But the respects thereof are nice and trivial,</LINE>
<LINE>All circumstances well considered.</LINE>
<LINE>You say that Edward is your brother's son:</LINE>
<LINE>So say we too, but not by Edward's wife;</LINE>
<LINE>For first he was contract to Lady Lucy--</LINE>
<LINE>Your mother lives a witness to that vow--</LINE>
<LINE>And afterward by substitute betroth'd</LINE>
<LINE>To Bona, sister to the King of France.</LINE>
<LINE>These both put by a poor petitioner,</LINE>
<LINE>A care-crazed mother of a many children,</LINE>
<LINE>A beauty-waning and distressed widow,</LINE>
<LINE>Even in the afternoon of her best days,</LINE>
<LINE>Made prize and purchase of his lustful eye,</LINE>
<LINE>Seduced the pitch and height of all his thoughts</LINE>
<LINE>To base declension and loathed bigamy</LINE>
<LINE>By her, in his unlawful bed, he got</LINE>
<LINE>This Edward, whom our manners term the prince.</LINE>
<LINE>More bitterly could I expostulate,</LINE>
<LINE>Save that, for reverence to some alive,</LINE>
<LINE>I give a sparing limit to my tongue.</LINE>
<LINE>Then, good my lord, take to your royal self</LINE>
<LINE>This proffer'd benefit of dignity;</LINE>
<LINE>If non to bless us and the land withal,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry</LINE>
<LINE>From the corruption of abusing times,</LINE>
<LINE>Unto a lineal true-derived course.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Lord Mayor</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do, good my lord, your citizens entreat you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BUCKINGHAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Refuse not, mighty lord, this proffer'd love.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CATESBY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, make them joyful, grant their lawful suit!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alas, why would you heap these cares on me?</LINE>
<LINE>I am unfit for state and majesty;</LINE>
<LINE>I do beseech you, take it not amiss;</LINE>
<LINE>I cannot nor I will not yield to you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BUCKINGHAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If you refuse it,--as, in love and zeal,</LINE>
<LINE>Loath to depose the child, Your brother's son;</LINE>
<LINE>As well we know your tenderness of heart</LINE>
<LINE>And gentle, kind, effeminate remorse,</LINE>
<LINE>Which we have noted in you to your kin,</LINE>
<LINE>And egally indeed to all estates,--</LINE>
<LINE>Yet whether you accept our suit or no,</LINE>
<LINE>Your brother's son shall never reign our king;</LINE>
<LINE>But we will plant some other in the throne,</LINE>
<LINE>To the disgrace and downfall of your house:</LINE>
<LINE>And in this resolution here we leave you.--</LINE>
<LINE>Come, citizens: 'zounds! I'll entreat no more.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, do not swear, my lord of Buckingham.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit BUCKINGHAM with the Citizens</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CATESBY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Call them again, my lord, and accept their suit.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>ANOTHER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do, good my lord, lest all the land do rue it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Would you enforce me to a world of care?</LINE>
<LINE>Well, call them again. I am not made of stone,</LINE>
<LINE>But penetrable to your. kind entreats,</LINE>
<LINE>Albeit against my conscience and my soul.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Re-enter BUCKINGHAM and the rest</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Cousin of Buckingham, and you sage, grave men,</LINE>
<LINE>Since you will buckle fortune on my back,</LINE>
<LINE>To bear her burthen, whether I will or no,</LINE>
<LINE>I must have patience to endure the load:</LINE>
<LINE>But if black scandal or foul-faced reproach</LINE>
<LINE>Attend the sequel of your imposition,</LINE>
<LINE>Your mere enforcement shall acquittance me</LINE>
<LINE>From all the impure blots and stains thereof;</LINE>
<LINE>For God he knows, and you may partly see,</LINE>
<LINE>How far I am from the desire thereof.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Lord Mayor</SPEAKER>
<LINE>God bless your grace! we see it, and will say it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In saying so, you shall but say the truth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Right well, dear madam. By your patience,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN ELIZABETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O Dorset, speak not to me, get thee hence!</LINE>
<LINE>Death and destruction dog thee at the heels;</LINE>
<LINE>Thy mother's name is ominous to children.</LINE>
<LINE>If thou wilt outstrip death, go cross the seas,</LINE>
<LINE>And live with Richmond, from the reach of hell</LINE>
<LINE>Go, hie thee, hie thee from this slaughter-house,</LINE>
<LINE>Lest thou increase the number of the dead;</LINE>

<LINE>No! why?  When he that is my husband now</LINE>
<LINE>Came to me, as I follow'd Henry's corse,</LINE>
<LINE>When scarce the blood was well wash'd from his hands</LINE>
<LINE>Which issued from my other angel husband</LINE>
<LINE>And that dead saint which then I weeping follow'd;</LINE>
<LINE>O, when, I say, I look'd on Richard's face,</LINE>
<LINE>This was my wish: 'Be thou,' quoth I, ' accursed,</LINE>
<LINE>For making me, so young, so old a widow!</LINE>
<LINE>And, when thou wed'st, let sorrow haunt thy bed;</LINE>
<LINE>And be thy wife--if any be so mad--</LINE>
<LINE>As miserable by the life of thee</LINE>
<LINE>As thou hast made me by my dear lord's death!</LINE>
<LINE>Lo, ere I can repeat this curse again,</LINE>
<LINE>Even in so short a space, my woman's heart</LINE>
<LINE>Grossly grew captive to his honey words</LINE>
<LINE>And proved the subject of my own soul's curse,</LINE>
<LINE>Which ever since hath kept my eyes from rest;</LINE>
<LINE>For never yet one hour in his bed</LINE>
<LINE>Have I enjoy'd the golden dew of sleep,</LINE>
<LINE>But have been waked by his timorous dreams.</LINE>
<LINE>Besides, he hates me for my father Warwick;</LINE>
<LINE>And will, no doubt, shortly be rid of me.</LINE>

<LINE>My lord, I know a discontented gentleman,</LINE>

<SPEAKER>KING RICHARD III</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, let that pass. Dorset is fled to Richmond.</LINE>

<LINE>My lord, I claim your gift, my due by promise,</LINE>
<LINE>For which your honour and your faith is pawn'd;</LINE>

<LINE>As I remember, Henry the Sixth</LINE>
<LINE>Did prophesy that Richmond should be king,</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BUCKINGHAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord!</LINE>

<SPEAKER>BUCKINGHAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, your promise for the earldom,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING RICHARD III</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Richmond! When last I was at Exeter,</LINE>
<LINE>The mayor in courtesy show'd me the castle,</LINE>
<LINE>And call'd it Rougemont: at which name I started,</LINE>
<LINE>Because a bard of Ireland told me once</LINE>
<LINE>I should not live long after I saw Richmond.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BUCKINGHAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why let it strike?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING RICHARD III</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Because that, like a Jack, thou keep'st the stroke</LINE>
<LINE>Betwixt thy begging and my meditation.</LINE>
<LINE>I am not in the giving vein to-day.</LINE>

<LINE>To do this ruthless piece of butchery,</LINE>
<LINE>Although they were flesh'd villains, bloody dogs,</LINE>
<LINE>Melting with tenderness and kind compassion</LINE>
<LINE>Wept like two children in their deaths' sad stories.</LINE>
<LINE>'Lo, thus' quoth Dighton, 'lay those tender babes:'</LINE>
<LINE>'Thus, thus,' quoth Forrest, 'girdling one another</LINE>
<LINE>Within their innocent alabaster arms:</LINE>
<LINE>Their lips were four red roses on a stalk,</LINE>
<LINE>Which in their summer beauty kiss'd each other.</LINE>
<LINE>A book of prayers on their pillow lay;</LINE>
<LINE>Which once,' quoth Forrest, 'almost changed my mind;</LINE>
<LINE>But O! the devil'--there the villain stopp'd</LINE>
<LINE>Whilst Dighton thus told on: 'We smothered</LINE>
<LINE>The most replenished sweet work of nature,</LINE>
<LINE>That from the prime creation e'er she framed.'</LINE>
<LINE>Thus both are gone with conscience and remorse;</LINE>
<LINE>They could not speak; and so I left them both,</LINE>
<LINE>To bring this tidings to the bloody king.</LINE>

<LINE>Tell o'er your woes again by viewing mine:</LINE>
<LINE>I had an Edward, till a Richard kill'd him;</LINE>
<LINE>I had a Harry, till a Richard kill'd him:</LINE>

<SPEAKER>QUEEN MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou hadst a Clarence too, and Richard kill'd him.</LINE>
<LINE>From forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept</LINE>
<LINE>A hell-hound that doth hunt us all to death:</LINE>
<LINE>That dog, that had his teeth before his eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>To worry lambs and lap their gentle blood,</LINE>
<LINE>That foul defacer of God's handiwork,</LINE>
<LINE>That excellent grand tyrant of the earth,</LINE>
<LINE>That reigns in galled eyes of weeping souls,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy womb let loose, to chase us to our graves.</LINE>
<LINE>O upright, just, and true-disposing God,</LINE>
<LINE>How do I thank thee, that this carnal cur</LINE>
<LINE>Preys on the issue of his mother's body,</LINE>
<LINE>And makes her pew-fellow with others' moan!</LINE>

<SPEAKER>QUEEN MARGARET</SPEAKER>

<LINE>Thy Edward he is dead, that stabb'd my Edward:</LINE>
<LINE>Thy other Edward dead, to quit my Edward;</LINE>
<LINE>Young York he is but boot, because both they</LINE>
<LINE>Match not the high perfection of my loss:</LINE>
<LINE>Thy Clarence he is dead that kill'd my Edward;</LINE>
<LINE>And the beholders of this tragic play,</LINE>
<LINE>The adulterate Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey,</LINE>
<LINE>Untimely smother'd in their dusky graves.</LINE>
<LINE>Richard yet lives, hell's black intelligencer,</LINE>
<LINE>Only reserved their factor, to buy souls</LINE>
<LINE>And send them thither: but at hand, at hand,</LINE>
<LINE>Ensues his piteous and unpitied end:</LINE>
<LINE>Earth gapes, hell burns, fiends roar, saints pray.</LINE>
<LINE>To have him suddenly convey'd away.</LINE>
<LINE>Cancel his bond of life, dear God, I prey,</LINE>
<LINE>That I may live to say, The dog is dead!</LINE>

<LINE>I call'd thee then vain flourish of my fortune;</LINE>

<LINE>The flattering index of a direful pageant;</LINE>
<LINE>One heaved a-high, to be hurl'd down below;</LINE>
<LINE>A mother only mock'd with two sweet babes;</LINE>
<LINE>A dream of what thou wert, a breath, a bubble,</LINE>
<LINE>A sign of dignity, a garish flag,</LINE>
<LINE>To be the aim of every dangerous shot,</LINE>
<LINE>A queen in jest, only to fill the scene.</LINE>
<LINE>Where is thy husband now? where be thy brothers?</LINE>
<LINE>Where are thy children? wherein dost thou, joy?</LINE>
<LINE>Who sues to thee and cries 'God save the queen'?</LINE>
<LINE>Where be the bending peers that flatter'd thee?</LINE>
<LINE>Where be the thronging troops that follow'd thee?</LINE>
<LINE>Decline all this, and see what now thou art:</LINE>
<LINE>For happy wife, a most distressed widow;</LINE>
<LINE>For joyful mother, one that wails the name;</LINE>
<LINE>For queen, a very caitiff crown'd with care;</LINE>
<LINE>For one being sued to, one that humbly sues;</LINE>
<LINE>For one that scorn'd at me, now scorn'd of me;</LINE>
<LINE>For one being fear'd of all, now fearing one;</LINE>
<LINE>For one commanding all, obey'd of none.</LINE>
<LINE>Thus hath the course of justice wheel'd about,</LINE>
<LINE>And left thee but a very prey to time;</LINE>
<LINE>Having no more but thought of what thou wert,</LINE>
<LINE>To torture thee the more, being what thou art.</LINE>
<LINE>Thou didst usurp my place, and dost thou not</LINE>
<LINE>Usurp the just proportion of my sorrow?</LINE>
<LINE>Now thy proud neck bears half my burthen'd yoke;</LINE>
<LINE>From which even here I slip my weary neck,</LINE>
<LINE>And leave the burthen of it all on thee.</LINE>
<LINE>Farewell, York's wife, and queen of sad mischance:</LINE>
<LINE>These English woes will make me smile in France.</LINE>

<LINE>Forbear to sleep the nights, and fast the days;</LINE>
<LINE>Compare dead happiness with living woe;</LINE>
<LINE>Think that thy babes were fairer than they were,</LINE>
<LINE>And he that slew them fouler than he is:</LINE>
<LINE>Bettering thy loss makes the bad causer worse:</LINE>
<LINE>Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.</LINE>

<LINE>I will be mild and gentle in my speech.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING RICHARD III</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And brief, good mother; for I am in haste.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUCHESS OF YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Art thou so hasty? I have stay'd for thee,</LINE>
<LINE>God knows, in anguish, pain and agony.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING RICHARD III</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And came I not at last to comfort you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUCHESS OF YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, by the holy rood, thou know'st it well,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou camest on earth to make the earth my hell.</LINE>
<LINE>A grievous burthen was thy birth to me;</LINE>
<LINE>Tetchy and wayward was thy infancy;</LINE>
<LINE>Thy school-days frightful, desperate, wild, and furious,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy prime of manhood daring, bold, and venturous,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy age confirm'd, proud, subdued, bloody,</LINE>
<LINE>treacherous,</LINE>
<LINE>More mild, but yet more harmful, kind in hatred:</LINE>
<LINE>What comfortable hour canst thou name,</LINE>
<LINE>That ever graced me in thy company?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING RICHARD III</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Faith, none, but Humphrey Hour, that call'd</LINE>
<LINE>your grace</LINE>
<LINE>To breakfast once forth of my company.</LINE>
<LINE>If I be so disgracious in your sight,</LINE>
<LINE>Let me march on, and not offend your grace.</LINE>
<LINE>Strike the drum.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUCHESS OF YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I prithee, hear me speak.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING RICHARD III</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You speak too bitterly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUCHESS OF YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hear me a word;</LINE>
<LINE>For I shall never speak to thee again.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING RICHARD III</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUCHESS OF YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Either thou wilt die, by God's just ordinance,</LINE>
<LINE>Ere from this war thou turn a conqueror,</LINE>
<LINE>Or I with grief and extreme age shall perish</LINE>
<LINE>And never look upon thy face again.</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore take with thee my most heavy curse;</LINE>
<LINE>Which, in the day of battle, tire thee more</LINE>
<LINE>Than all the complete armour that thou wear'st!</LINE>
<LINE>My prayers on the adverse party fight;</LINE>
<LINE>And there the little souls of Edward's children</LINE>
<LINE>Whisper the spirits of thine enemies</LINE>
<LINE>And promise them success and victory.</LINE>
<LINE>Bloody thou art, bloody will be thy end;</LINE>
<LINE>Shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN ELIZABETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Though far more cause, yet much less spirit to curse</LINE>
<LINE>Abides in me; I say amen to all.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING RICHARD III</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Stay, madam; I must speak a word with you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN ELIZABETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have no more sons of the royal blood</LINE>
<LINE>For thee to murder: for my daughters, Richard,</LINE>
<LINE>They shall be praying nuns, not weeping queens;</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore level not to hit their lives.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING RICHARD III</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You have a daughter call'd Elizabeth,</LINE>
<LINE>Virtuous and fair, royal and gracious.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN ELIZABETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And must she die for this? O, let her live,</LINE>
<LINE>And I'll corrupt her manners, stain her beauty;</LINE>
<LINE>Slander myself as false to Edward's bed;</LINE>
<LINE>Throw over her the veil of infamy:</LINE>
<LINE>So she may live unscarr'd of bleeding slaughter,</LINE>
<LINE>I will confess she was not Edward's daughter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING RICHARD III</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Wrong not her birth, she is of royal blood.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN ELIZABETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To save her life, I'll say she is not so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING RICHARD III</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Her life is only safest in her birth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN ELIZABETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And only in that safety died her brothers.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING RICHARD III</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lo, at their births good stars were opposite.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN ELIZABETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, to their lives bad friends were contrary.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING RICHARD III</SPEAKER>
<LINE>All unavoided is the doom of destiny.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN ELIZABETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>True, when avoided grace makes destiny:</LINE>
<LINE>My babes were destined to a fairer death,</LINE>
<LINE>If grace had bless'd thee with a fairer life.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING RICHARD III</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You speak as if that I had slain my cousins.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN ELIZABETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Cousins, indeed; and by their uncle cozen'd</LINE>
<LINE>Of comfort, kingdom, kindred, freedom, life.</LINE>
<LINE>Whose hand soever lanced their tender hearts,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy head, all indirectly, gave direction:</LINE>
<LINE>No doubt the murderous knife was dull and blunt</LINE>
<LINE>Till it was whetted on thy stone-hard heart,</LINE>
<LINE>To revel in the entrails of my lambs.</LINE>
<LINE>But that still use of grief makes wild grief tame,</LINE>
<LINE>My tongue should to thy ears not name my boys</LINE>
<LINE>Till that my nails were anchor'd in thine eyes;</LINE>
<LINE>And I, in such a desperate bay of death,</LINE>
<LINE>Like a poor bark, of sails and tackling reft,</LINE>
<LINE>Rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING RICHARD III</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam, so thrive I in my enterprise</LINE>
<LINE>And dangerous success of bloody wars,</LINE>
<LINE>As I intend more good to you and yours,</LINE>
<LINE>Than ever you or yours were by me wrong'd!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN ELIZABETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What good is cover'd with the face of heaven,</LINE>
<LINE>To be discover'd, that can do me good?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING RICHARD III</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The advancement of your children, gentle lady.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN ELIZABETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Up to some scaffold, there to lose their heads?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING RICHARD III</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, to the dignity and height of honour</LINE>
<LINE>The high imperial type of this earth's glory.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN ELIZABETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Flatter my sorrows with report of it;</LINE>
<LINE>Tell me what state, what dignity, what honour,</LINE>
<LINE>Canst thou demise to any child of mine?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING RICHARD III</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Even all I have; yea, and myself and all,</LINE>
<LINE>Will I withal endow a child of thine;</LINE>
<LINE>So in the Lethe of thy angry soul</LINE>
<LINE>Thou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongs</LINE>
<LINE>Which thou supposest I have done to thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN ELIZABETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Be brief, lest that be process of thy kindness</LINE>
<LINE>Last longer telling than thy kindness' date.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING RICHARD III</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then know, that from my soul I love thy daughter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN ELIZABETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My daughter's mother thinks it with her soul.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING RICHARD III</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What do you think?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN ELIZABETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That thou dost love my daughter from thy soul:</LINE>
<LINE>So from thy soul's love didst thou love her brothers;</LINE>
<LINE>And from my heart's love I do thank thee for it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING RICHARD III</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Be not so hasty to confound my meaning:</LINE>
<LINE>I mean, that with my soul I love thy daughter,</LINE>
<LINE>And mean to make her queen of England.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN ELIZABETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Say then, who dost thou mean shall be her king?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING RICHARD III</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Even he that makes her queen who should be else?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN ELIZABETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, thou?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING RICHARD III</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I, even I: what think you of it, madam?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN ELIZABETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How canst thou woo her?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING RICHARD III</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That would I learn of you,</LINE>
<LINE>As one that are best acquainted with her humour.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN ELIZABETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And wilt thou learn of me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING RICHARD III</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam, with all my heart.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN ELIZABETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Send to her, by the man that slew her brothers,</LINE>
<LINE>A pair of bleeding-hearts; thereon engrave</LINE>
<LINE>Edward and York; then haply she will weep:</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore present to her--as sometime Margaret</LINE>
<LINE>Did to thy father, steep'd in Rutland's blood,--</LINE>
<LINE>A handkerchief; which, say to her, did drain</LINE>
<LINE>The purple sap from her sweet brother's body</LINE>
<LINE>And bid her dry her weeping eyes therewith.</LINE>
<LINE>If this inducement force her not to love,</LINE>
<LINE>Send her a story of thy noble acts;</LINE>
<LINE>Tell her thou madest away her uncle Clarence,</LINE>
<LINE>Her uncle Rivers; yea, and, for her sake,</LINE>
<LINE>Madest quick conveyance with her good aunt Anne.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING RICHARD III</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, come, you mock me; this is not the way</LINE>
<LINE>To win our daughter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN ELIZABETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There is no other way</LINE>
<LINE>Unless thou couldst put on some other shape,</LINE>
<LINE>And not be Richard that hath done all this.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING RICHARD III</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Say that I did all this for love of her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN ELIZABETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, then indeed she cannot choose but hate thee,</LINE>
<LINE>Having bought love with such a bloody spoil.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING RICHARD III</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Look, what is done cannot be now amended:</LINE>
<LINE>Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes,</LINE>
<LINE>Which after hours give leisure to repent.</LINE>
<LINE>If I did take the kingdom from your sons,</LINE>
<LINE>To make amends, Ill give it to your daughter.</LINE>
<LINE>If I have kill'd the issue of your womb,</LINE>
<LINE>To quicken your increase, I will beget</LINE>
<LINE>Mine issue of your blood upon your daughter</LINE>
<LINE>A grandam's name is little less in love</LINE>
<LINE>Than is the doting title of a mother;</LINE>
<LINE>They are as children but one step below,</LINE>
<LINE>Even of your mettle, of your very blood;</LINE>
<LINE>Of an one pain, save for a night of groans</LINE>
<LINE>Endured of her, for whom you bid like sorrow.</LINE>
<LINE>Your children were vexation to your youth,</LINE>
<LINE>But mine shall be a comfort to your age.</LINE>
<LINE>The loss you have is but a son being king,</LINE>
<LINE>And by that loss your daughter is made queen.</LINE>
<LINE>I cannot make you what amends I would,</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore accept such kindness as I can.</LINE>
<LINE>Dorset your son, that with a fearful soul</LINE>
<LINE>Leads discontented steps in foreign soil,</LINE>
<LINE>This fair alliance quickly shall call home</LINE>
<LINE>To high promotions and great dignity:</LINE>
<LINE>The king, that calls your beauteous daughter wife.</LINE>
<LINE>Familiarly shall call thy Dorset brother;</LINE>
<LINE>Again shall you be mother to a king,</LINE>
<LINE>And all the ruins of distressful times</LINE>
<LINE>Repair'd with double riches of content.</LINE>
<LINE>What! we have many goodly days to see:</LINE>
<LINE>The liquid drops of tears that you have shed</LINE>
<LINE>Shall come again, transform'd to orient pearl,</LINE>
<LINE>Advantaging their loan with interest</LINE>
<LINE>Of ten times double gain of happiness.</LINE>
<LINE>Go, then my mother, to thy daughter go</LINE>
<LINE>Make bold her bashful years with your experience;</LINE>
<LINE>Prepare her ears to hear a wooer's tale</LINE>
<LINE>Put in her tender heart the aspiring flame</LINE>
<LINE>Of golden sovereignty; acquaint the princess</LINE>
<LINE>With the sweet silent hours of marriage joys</LINE>
<LINE>And when this arm of mine hath chastised</LINE>
<LINE>The petty rebel, dull-brain'd Buckingham,</LINE>
<LINE>Bound with triumphant garlands will I come</LINE>
<LINE>And lead thy daughter to a conqueror's bed;</LINE>
<LINE>To whom I will retail my conquest won,</LINE>
<LINE>And she shall be sole victress, Caesar's Caesar.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN ELIZABETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What were I best to say? her father's brother</LINE>
<LINE>Would be her lord? or shall I say, her uncle?</LINE>
<LINE>Or, he that slew her brothers and her uncles?</LINE>
<LINE>Under what title shall I woo for thee,</LINE>
<LINE>That God, the law, my honour and her love,</LINE>
<LINE>Can make seem pleasing to her tender years?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING RICHARD III</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Infer fair England's peace by this alliance.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN ELIZABETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Which she shall purchase with still lasting war.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING RICHARD III</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Say that the king, which may command, entreats.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN ELIZABETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That at her hands which the king's King forbids.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING RICHARD III</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Say, she shall be a high and mighty queen.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN ELIZABETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To wail the tide, as her mother doth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING RICHARD III</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Say, I will love her everlastingly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN ELIZABETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But how long shall that title 'ever' last?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING RICHARD III</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sweetly in force unto her fair life's end.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN ELIZABETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But how long fairly shall her sweet lie last?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING RICHARD III</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So long as heaven and nature lengthens it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN ELIZABETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So long as hell and Richard likes of it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING RICHARD III</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Say, I, her sovereign, am her subject love.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN ELIZABETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But she, your subject, loathes such sovereignty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING RICHARD III</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Be eloquent in my behalf to her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN ELIZABETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>An honest tale speeds best being plainly told.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING RICHARD III</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then in plain terms tell her my loving tale.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN ELIZABETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Plain and not honest is too harsh a style.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING RICHARD III</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your reasons are too shallow and too quick.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN ELIZABETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O no, my reasons are too deep and dead;</LINE>
<LINE>Too deep and dead, poor infants, in their grave.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING RICHARD III</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Harp not on that string, madam; that is past.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN ELIZABETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Harp on it still shall I till heart-strings break.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING RICHARD III</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, by my George, my garter, and my crown,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN ELIZABETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Profaned, dishonour'd, and the third usurp'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING RICHARD III</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I swear--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN ELIZABETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By nothing; for this is no oath:</LINE>
<LINE>The George, profaned, hath lost his holy honour;</LINE>
<LINE>The garter, blemish'd, pawn'd his knightly virtue;</LINE>
<LINE>The crown, usurp'd, disgraced his kingly glory.</LINE>
<LINE>if something thou wilt swear to be believed,</LINE>
<LINE>Swear then by something that thou hast not wrong'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING RICHARD III</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, by the world--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN ELIZABETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis full of thy foul wrongs.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING RICHARD III</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My father's death--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN ELIZABETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thy life hath that dishonour'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING RICHARD III</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then, by myself--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN ELIZABETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thyself thyself misusest.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING RICHARD III</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why then, by God--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN ELIZABETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>God's wrong is most of all.</LINE>
<LINE>If thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by Him,</LINE>
<LINE>The unity the king thy brother made</LINE>
<LINE>Had not been broken, nor my brother slain:</LINE>
<LINE>If thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by Him,</LINE>
<LINE>The imperial metal, circling now thy brow,</LINE>
<LINE>Had graced the tender temples of my child,</LINE>
<LINE>And both the princes had been breathing here,</LINE>
<LINE>Which now, two tender playfellows to dust,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy broken faith hath made a prey for worms.</LINE>
<LINE>What canst thou swear by now?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING RICHARD III</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The time to come.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN ELIZABETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That thou hast wronged in the time o'erpast;</LINE>
<LINE>For I myself have many tears to wash</LINE>
<LINE>Hereafter time, for time past wrong'd by thee.</LINE>
<LINE>The children live, whose parents thou hast</LINE>
<LINE>slaughter'd,</LINE>
<LINE>Ungovern'd youth, to wail it in their age;</LINE>
<LINE>The parents live, whose children thou hast butcher'd,</LINE>
<LINE>Old wither'd plants, to wail it with their age.</LINE>
<LINE>Swear not by time to come; for that thou hast</LINE>
<LINE>Misused ere used, by time misused o'erpast.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING RICHARD III</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As I intend to prosper and repent,</LINE>
<LINE>So thrive I in my dangerous attempt</LINE>
<LINE>Of hostile arms! myself myself confound!</LINE>
<LINE>Heaven and fortune bar me happy hours!</LINE>
<LINE>Day, yield me not thy light; nor, night, thy rest!</LINE>
<LINE>Be opposite all planets of good luck</LINE>
<LINE>To my proceedings, if, with pure heart's love,</LINE>
<LINE>Immaculate devotion, holy thoughts,</LINE>
<LINE>I tender not thy beauteous princely daughter!</LINE>
<LINE>In her consists my happiness and thine;</LINE>
<LINE>Without her, follows to this land and me,</LINE>
<LINE>To thee, herself, and many a Christian soul,</LINE>
<LINE>Death, desolation, ruin and decay:</LINE>
<LINE>It cannot be avoided but by this;</LINE>
<LINE>It will not be avoided but by this.</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore, good mother,--I must can you so--</LINE>
<LINE>Be the attorney of my love to her:</LINE>
<LINE>Plead what I will be, not what I have been;</LINE>
<LINE>Not my deserts, but what I will deserve:</LINE>
<LINE>Urge the necessity and state of times,</LINE>
<LINE>And be not peevish-fond in great designs.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN ELIZABETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Shall I be tempted of the devil thus?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING RICHARD III</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, if the devil tempt thee to do good.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN ELIZABETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Shall I forget myself to be myself?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING RICHARD III</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, if yourself's remembrance wrong yourself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN ELIZABETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But thou didst kill my children.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING RICHARD III</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But in your daughter's womb I bury them:</LINE>
<LINE>Where in that nest of spicery they shall breed</LINE>
<LINE>Selves of themselves, to your recomforture.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN ELIZABETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Shall I go win my daughter to thy will?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING RICHARD III</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And be a happy mother by the deed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN ELIZABETH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I go. Write to me very shortly.</LINE>
<LINE>And you shall understand from me her mind.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>My gracious sovereign, on the western coast</LINE>

<SPEAKER>KING RICHARD III</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Give me another horse: bind up my wounds.</LINE>
<LINE>Have mercy, Jesu!--Soft! I did but dream.</LINE>
<LINE>O coward conscience, how dost thou afflict me!</LINE>
<LINE>The lights burn blue. It is now dead midnight.</LINE>
<LINE>Cold fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh.</LINE>
<LINE>What do I fear?  myself?  there's none else by:</LINE>
<LINE>Richard loves Richard; that is, I am I.</LINE>
<LINE>Is there a murderer here?  No. Yes, I am:</LINE>
<LINE>Then fly. What, from myself?   Great reason why:</LINE>
<LINE>Lest I revenge. What, myself upon myself?</LINE>
<LINE>Alack. I love myself. Wherefore?  for any good</LINE>
<LINE>That I myself have done unto myself?</LINE>
<LINE>O, no! alas, I rather hate myself</LINE>
<LINE>For hateful deeds committed by myself!</LINE>
<LINE>I am a villain: yet I lie. I am not.</LINE>
<LINE>Fool, of thyself speak well: fool, do not flatter.</LINE>
<LINE>My conscience hath a thousand several tongues,</LINE>
<LINE>And every tongue brings in a several tale,</LINE>
<LINE>And every tale condemns me for a villain.</LINE>
<LINE>Perjury, perjury, in the high'st degree</LINE>
<LINE>Murder, stem murder, in the direst degree;</LINE>
<LINE>All several sins, all used in each degree,</LINE>
<LINE>Throng to the bar, crying all, Guilty! guilty!</LINE>
<LINE>I shall despair. There is no creature loves me;</LINE>
<LINE>And if I die, no soul shall pity me:</LINE>
<LINE>Nay, wherefore should they, since that I myself</LINE>
<LINE>Find in myself no pity to myself?</LINE>
<LINE>Methought the souls of all that I had murder'd</LINE>
<LINE>Came to my tent; and every one did threat</LINE>
<LINE>To-morrow's vengeance on the head of Richard.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RATCLIFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, good my lord, be not afraid of shadows.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING RICHARD III</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By the apostle Paul, shadows to-night</LINE>
<LINE>Have struck more terror to the soul of Richard</LINE>
<LINE>Than can the substance of ten thousand soldiers</LINE>
<LINE>Armed in proof, and led by shallow Richmond.</LINE>
<LINE>It is not yet near day. Come, go with me;</LINE>
<LINE>Under our tents I'll play the eaves-dropper,</LINE>
<LINE>To see if any mean to shrink from me.</LINE>

<LINE>Cry mercy, lords and watchful gentlemen,</LINE>
<LINE>That you have ta'en a tardy sluggard here.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORDS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How have you slept, my lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RICHMOND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The sweetest sleep, and fairest-boding dreams</LINE>
<LINE>That ever enter'd in a drowsy head,</LINE>
<LINE>Have I since your departure had, my lords.</LINE>
<LINE>Methought their souls, whose bodies Richard murder'd,</LINE>
<LINE>Came to my tent, and cried on victory:</LINE>
<LINE>I promise you, my soul is very jocund</LINE>
<LINE>In the remembrance of so fair a dream.</LINE>
<LINE>How far into the morning is it, lords?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RICHMOND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, then 'tis time to arm and give direction.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>His oration to his soldiers</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>More than I have said, loving countrymen,</LINE>
<LINE>The leisure and enforcement of the time</LINE>
<LINE>Forbids to dwell upon: yet remember this,</LINE>
<LINE>God and our good cause fight upon our side;</LINE>
<LINE>The prayers of holy saints and wronged souls,</LINE>
<LINE>Like high-rear'd bulwarks, stand before our faces;</LINE>
<LINE>Richard except, those whom we fight against</LINE>
<LINE>Had rather have us win than him they follow:</LINE>
<LINE>For what is he they follow?  truly, gentlemen,</LINE>
<LINE>A bloody tyrant and a homicide;</LINE>
<LINE>One raised in blood, and one in blood establish'd;</LINE>
<LINE>One that made means to come by what he hath,</LINE>
<LINE>And slaughter'd those that were the means to help him;</LINE>
<LINE>Abase foul stone, made precious by the foil</LINE>
<LINE>Of England's chair, where he is falsely set;</LINE>
<LINE>One that hath ever been God's enemy:</LINE>
<LINE>Then, if you fight against God's enemy,</LINE>
<LINE>God will in justice ward you as his soldiers;</LINE>
<LINE>If you do sweat to put a tyrant down,</LINE>
<LINE>You sleep in peace, the tyrant being slain;</LINE>
<LINE>If you do fight against your country's foes,</LINE>
<LINE>Your country's fat shall pay your pains the hire;</LINE>
<LINE>If you do fight in safeguard of your wives,</LINE>
<LINE>Your wives shall welcome home the conquerors;</LINE>
<LINE>If you do free your children from the sword,</LINE>
<LINE>Your children's children quit it in your age.</LINE>
<LINE>Then, in the name of God and all these rights,</LINE>
<LINE>Advance your standards, draw your willing swords.</LINE>
<LINE>For me, the ransom of my bold attempt</LINE>
<LINE>Shall be this cold corpse on the earth's cold face;</LINE>
<LINE>But if I thrive, the gain of my attempt</LINE>
<LINE>The least of you shall share his part thereof.</LINE>
<LINE>Sound drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully;</LINE>
<LINE>God and Saint George! Richmond and victory!</LINE>

<SPEAKER>RATCLIFF</SPEAKER>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RATCLIFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He smiled and said 'The better for our purpose.'</LINE>

<LINE>A black day will it be to somebody. Ratcliff!</LINE>

<SPEAKER>RATCLIFF</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord?</LINE>

<SPEAKER>KING RICHARD III</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The sun will not be seen to-day;</LINE>
<LINE>The sky doth frown and lour upon our army.</LINE>
<LINE>I would these dewy tears were from the ground.</LINE>
<LINE>Not shine to-day! Why, what is that to me</LINE>
<LINE>More than to Richmond?  for the selfsame heaven</LINE>
<LINE>That frowns on me looks sadly upon him.</LINE>

<LINE>Consisting equally of horse and foot;</LINE>
<LINE>Our archers shall be placed in the midst</LINE>
<LINE>John Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Earl of Surrey,</LINE>
<LINE>Shall have the leading of this foot and horse.</LINE>
<LINE>They thus directed, we will follow</LINE>
<LINE>In the main battle, whose puissance on either side</LINE>
<LINE>Shall be well winged with our chiefest horse.</LINE>
<LINE>This, and Saint George to boot! What think'st thou, Norfolk?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE><STAGEDIR>Reads</STAGEDIR></LINE>
<LINE>'Jockey of Norfolk, be not too bold,</LINE>
<LINE>For Dickon thy master is bought and sold.'</LINE>
<LINE>A thing devised by the enemy.</LINE>
<LINE>Go, gentleman, every man unto his charge</LINE>
<LINE>Let not our babbling dreams affright our souls:</LINE>
<LINE>Conscience is but a word that cowards use,</LINE>
<LINE>Devised at first to keep the strong in awe:</LINE>
<LINE>Our strong arms be our conscience, swords our law.</LINE>
<LINE>March on, join bravely, let us to't pell-mell</LINE>
<LINE>If not to heaven, then hand in hand to hell.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>His oration to his Army</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>What shall I say more than I have inferr'd?</LINE>
<LINE>Remember whom you are to cope withal;</LINE>
<LINE>A sort of vagabonds, rascals, and runaways,</LINE>
<LINE>A scum of Bretons, and base lackey peasants,</LINE>
<LINE>Whom their o'er-cloyed country vomits forth</LINE>
<LINE>To desperate ventures and assured destruction.</LINE>
<LINE>You sleeping safe, they bring to you unrest;</LINE>
<LINE>You having lands, and blest with beauteous wives,</LINE>
<LINE>They would restrain the one, distain the other.</LINE>
<LINE>And who doth lead them but a paltry fellow,</LINE>
<LINE>Long kept in Bretagne at our mother's cost?</LINE>
<LINE>A milk-sop, one that never in his life</LINE>
<LINE>Felt so much cold as over shoes in snow?</LINE>
<LINE>Let's whip these stragglers o'er the seas again;</LINE>
<LINE>Lash hence these overweening rags of France,</LINE>
<LINE>These famish'd beggars, weary of their lives;</LINE>
<LINE>Who, but for dreaming on this fond exploit,</LINE>
<LINE>For want of means, poor rats, had hang'd themselves:</LINE>
<LINE>If we be conquer'd, let men conquer us,</LINE>
<LINE>And not these bastard Bretons; whom our fathers</LINE>
<LINE>Have in their own land beaten, bobb'd, and thump'd,</LINE>
<LINE>And in record, left them the heirs of shame.</LINE>
<LINE>Shall these enjoy our lands?  lie with our wives?</LINE>
<LINE>Ravish our daughters?</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Drum afar off</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Hark! I hear their drum.</LINE>
<LINE>Fight, gentlemen of England! fight, bold yoemen!</LINE>
<LINE>Draw, archers, draw your arrows to the head!</LINE>
<LINE>Spur your proud horses hard, and ride in blood;</LINE>
<LINE>Amaze the welkin with your broken staves!</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter a Messenger</STAGEDIR>
