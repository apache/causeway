<h1>Shakespeare 2.00</h1>

<h2>Jon Bosak (bosak@eng.sun.com)<br>July 15, 1999</h2>

<p>This is shaksper.200, a set of the plays of William Shakespeare
marked up for electronic publication.  The set began as ASCII files
put into the public domain by Moby Lexical Tools in 1992.  They were
marked up in 1992 as a beginner's exercise in SGML DTD and stylesheet
design (originally using the DynaText proprietary stylesheet language)
and in 1996 were released along with a companion set of publicly
available religious texts as the earliest examples of real documents
marked up in (early) XML.  The current distribution conforms to the
XML 1.0 Recommendation released February 8, 1998.</p>

<h3>Caveat regarding Shakespeare scholarship</h3>

<p>Every time I have occasion to compare the text of these files with
a modern edition of Shakespeare (usually when someone points out a
problem that requires me to check against a printed text), I wonder
where in the world the Moby folks got the original.  They must have
used OCR to scan in a printed edition that had gone out of copyright,
which means that the source could have been published no later than
World War I.  My guess is that it was a late Victorian edition, but it
might have been much older.</p>

<p>In any case, the editorial style of the set is very different from
that of modern editions, and on general principles I strongly doubt
the critical accuracy of the text.  The set is provided, as it always
has been, purely as a learning exercise in SGML/XML markup, as a
benchmark for comparing the performance of SGML/XML processors, and as
a resource for testing stylesheet and search methodologies.  The text
is enjoyable reading, but the present edition should not be relied
upon for scholarly purposes.</p>

<h3>Copyright</h3>

<p>While the text has been in the public domain since 1992, the status
of the markup hasn't been clear.  For purposes of legal simplicity (I
think), I'm now asserting copyright over the markup to discourage the
circulation of variant versions while still allowing free
distribution.  Each play now includes the following notice:</p>

<blockquote>
ASCII text placed in the public domain by Moby Lexical Tools, 1992.<br>
SGML markup by Jon Bosak, 1992-1994.<br>
XML version by Jon Bosak, 1996-1999.<br>
The XML markup in this version is Copyright &#169; 1999 Jon Bosak.
This work may freely be distributed on condition that it not be
modified or altered in any way.
</blockquote>

<h3>What's new</h3>

<p>Unlike the companion 2.x version of the religious texts,
Shakespeare 2.00 does not differ significantly from the previous
release, version 1.10.  The main difference is that the DTD and the
XML declarations have at last been revised to conform to the final XML
1.0 Recommendation.  I've also corrected about 50 lines of bad tagging
in Henry IV Part 2 (Act 2, Scene 1) and de-Americanized the spelling
of the word "Labour" in the title "Love's Labour's Lost" (yes, there
are properly two apostrophes!).  My thanks to Michael Kay for pointing
out these errors.  None of the changes should significantly affect
comparisons with processing tests run against earlier versions.</p>

<p>I had originally intended to supply a set of DSSSL stylesheets for
the plays just as I did for the religious texts -- hence the delay in
making this set available.  I have given up on finding the time to do
this right now.  Hopefully I will include stylesheets in a future
release; I have left in a few small ancillary files in anticipation of
this.</p>

<h3>Manifest</h3>

<p>This distribution includes the following files, all of which should
be installed in the same directory:</p>

<pre>
  shaksper.htm     this file

  play.dtd         DTD for testaments

  scripts for batch validation using nsgmls:

    vs              a bash script for validating a play as SGML
    vx              a bash script for validating a play as XML

  ancillary files left in for future DSSSL processing (these are
  not needed for most generic XML processing):

    catalog         SGML Open (OASIS) catalog for public identifiers
    dsssl.dtd       DSSSL DTD
    fot.dtd         FOT (flow object tree) DTD
    style-sheet.dtd DTD for DSSSL stylesheets
    xml.dcl         XML SGML declaration
    xml.soc         XML catalog

  the plays are the thing:

    a_and_c.xml
    all_well.xml
    as_you.xml
    com_err.xml
    coriolan.xml
    cymbelin.xml
    dream.xml
    hamlet.xml
    hen_iv_1.xml
    hen_iv_2.xml
    hen_v.xml
    hen_vi_1.xml
    hen_vi_2.xml
    hen_vi_3.xml
    hen_viii.xml
    j_caesar.xml
    john.xml
    lear.xml
    lll.xml
    m_for_m.xml
    m_wives.xml
    macbeth.xml
    merchant.xml
    much_ado.xml
    othello.xml
    pericles.xml
    r_and_j.xml
    rich_ii.xml
    rich_iii.xml
    t_night.xml
    taming.xml
    tempest.xml
    timon.xml
    titus.xml
    troilus.xml
    two_gent.xml
    win_tale.xml
</pre>

<h3>Running the scripts</h3>

<p>The files in this set were built and tested in Windows 95 using
scripts running under the Gnu bash shell.  DOS batch files should work
equally well, but I don't have the patience to deal with them.</p>

<p>Assuming that nsgmls (part of the Jade distribution) has been
installed and is in the search path, the scripts named vs and vx are
typically run under bash like this:</p>

<pre>
   for i in *.xml; do echo $i; vs $i; done
   for i in *.xml; do echo $i; vx $i; done
</pre>

<p>The first command line performs a validity check of all the plays
as SGML files, and the second performs a validity check of all the
plays as XML files.  Note that both scripts change the values of SP
environment variables.</p>
