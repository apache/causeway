There are two main parts to using fixture scripts: the `FixtureScripts` domain service class, and the `FixtureScript` view model class:

* The role of the `FixtureScripts` domain service is to locate all fixture scripts from the classpath and to let them be invoked, either from an integration test/BDD spec or from the UI of your Isis app.

* The role of `FixtureScript` meanwhile is to subclass for each of the scenarios that you want to define.
You can also subclass from `FixtureScript` to create helpers; more on this below.

Let's look at `FixtureScripts` domain service in more detail first.

== `FixtureScripts`

The framework provides a default implementation of `FixtureScripts` domain service, namely the xref:refguide:applib-svc:testing/FixtureScripts.adoc[`FixtureScriptsDefault`] domain service.
This is annotated to be rendered on the secondary "Prototyping" menu.

The behaviour of this domain menu service can be refined by providing an implementation of the optional xref:refguide:applib-svc:testing/FixtureScriptsSpecificationProvider.adoc[`FixtureScriptsSpecificationProvider`] SPI.

For example, here's the `FixtureScriptsSpecificationProvider` service that's generated by the xref:simpleapp:ROOT:about.adoc[SimpleApp archetype]:

[source,java]
----
@DomainService( nature = NatureOfService.DOMAIN )
public class DomainAppFixtureScriptsSpecificationProvider
                    implements FixtureScriptsSpecificationProvider {
    public FixtureScriptsSpecification getSpecification() {
        return FixtureScriptsSpecification
            .builder(DomainAppFixtureScriptsSpecificationProvider.class)               // <1>
            .with(FixtureScripts.MultipleExecutionStrategy.EXECUTE)                    // <2>
            .withRunScriptDefault(DomainAppDemo.class)                                 // <3>
            .withRunScriptDropDown(FixtureScriptsSpecification.DropDownPolicy.CHOICES) // <4>
            .withRecreate(DomainAppDemo.class)                                         // <5>
            .build();
    }
}
----
<1> search for all fixture scripts under the package containing this class
<2> if the same fixture script (class) is encountered more than once, then run anyway; more on this in xref:testing:fixtures:about/api-and-usage.adoc#organizing[Organizing Fixture scripts], below.
<3> specify the fixture script class to provide as the default for the service's "run fixture script" action
<4> whether the service's "run fixture script" action should display other fixture scripts using a choices drop down or (if there are very many of them) using an auto-complete
<5> if present, enables a "recreate objects and return first" action to be displayed in the UI


Here's how the domain service looks like in the UI:

image::prototyping-menu.png[width="700px",link="{imagesdir}/prototyping-menu.png"]

and here's what the `runFixtureScript` action prompt looks like:

image::prompt.png[width="700px",link="{imagesdir}/prompt.png"]


when this is executed, the resultant objects (actually, instances of FixtureResult`) are shown in the UI:

image::result-list.png[width="700px",link="{imagesdir}/result-list.png"]



If you had defined many fixture scripts then a drop-down might become unwieldy, in which case your code would probably override the `autoComplete...())` instead:

[source,java]
----
    @Override
    public List<FixtureScript> autoComplete0RunFixtureScript(final @MinLength(1) String searchArg) {
        return super.autoComplete0RunFixtureScript(searchArg);
    }

----

You are free, of course, to add additional "convenience" actions into it if you wish for the most commonly used/demo'd setups ; you'll find that the xref:simpleapp:ROOT:about.adoc[SimpleApp archetype] adds this additional action:

[source,java]
----
    @Action(
            restrictTo = RestrictTo.PROTOTYPING
    )
    @ActionLayout(
            cssClassFa="fa fa-refresh"
    )
    @MemberOrder(sequence="20")
    public Object recreateObjectsAndReturnFirst() {
        final List<FixtureResult> run = findFixtureScriptFor(RecreateSimpleObjects.class).run(null);
        return run.get(0).getObject();
    }
----

Let's now look at the `FixtureScript` class, where there's a bit more going on.




== `FixtureScript`

A fixture script is ultimately just a block of code that can be executed, so it's up to you how you implement it to set up the system.
However, we strongly recommend that you use it to invoke actions on business objects, in essence to replay what a real-life user would have done.
That way, the fixture script will remain valid even if the underlying implementation of the system changes in the future.

For example, here's a fixture script called `RecreateSimpleObjects`.
(This used to be part of the xref:simpleapp:ROOT:about.adoc[SimpleApp archetype], though the archetype now ships with a more sophisticated design, discussed below):

[source,java]
----
@lombok.Accessors(chain = true)
public class RecreateSimpleObjects extends FixtureScript {                   // <1>

    public final List<String> NAMES = Collections.unmodifiableList(Arrays.asList(
            "Foo", "Bar", "Baz", "Frodo", "Froyo",
            "Fizz", "Bip", "Bop", "Bang", "Boo"));                           // <2>
    public RecreateSimpleObjects() {
        withDiscoverability(Discoverability.DISCOVERABLE);                   // <3>
    }

    @lombok.Getter @lombok.Setter
    private Integer number;                                                  // <4>

    @lombok.Getter
    private final List<SimpleObject> simpleObjects = Lists.newArrayList();   // <5>

    @Override
    protected void execute(final ExecutionContext ec) {          // <6>
        // defaults
        final int number = defaultParam("number", ec, 3);        // <7>
        // validate
        if(number < 0 || number > NAMES.size()) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException(
                String.format("number must be in range [0,%d)", NAMES.size()));
        }
        // execute
        ec.executeChild(this, new SimpleObjectsTearDown());      // <8>
        for (int i = 0; i < number; i++) {
            final SimpleObjectCreate fs =
                new SimpleObjectCreate().setName(NAMES.get(i));
            ec.executeChild(this, fs.getName(), fs);             // <9>
            simpleObjects.add(fs.getSimpleObject());             // <10>
        }
    }
}
----
<1> inherit from `org.apache.isis.applib.fixturescripts.FixtureScript`
<2> a hard-coded list of values for the names.
Note that the (non-ASF) link:https://platform.incode.org[Incode Platform^]'s fakedata module could also have been used
<3> whether the script is "discoverable"; in other words whether it should be rendered in the drop-down by the `FixtureScripts` service
<4> input property: the number of objects to create, up to 10; for the calling test to specify, but note this is optional and has a default (see below).
It's important that a wrapper class is used (ie `java.lang.Integer`, not `int`)
<5> output property: the generated list of objects, for the calling test to grab
<6> the mandatory execute(...) API
<7> the `defaultParam(...)` (inherited from `FixtureScript`) will default the `number` property (using Java's Reflection API) if none was specified
<8> call another fixture script (`SimpleObjectsTearDown`) using the provided `ExecutionContext`.
Note that although the fixture script is a view model, it's fine to simply instantiate it (rather than using `FactoryService#instantiate(...)`).
<9> calling another fixture script (`SimpleObjectCreate`) using the provided `ExecutionContext`
<10> adding the created object to the list, for the calling object to use.


Because this script has exposed a "number" property, it's possible to set this from within the UI.
For example:

image::prompt-specifying-number.png[width="700px",link="{imagesdir}/prompt-specifying-number.png"]

When this is executed, the framework will parse the text and attempt to reflectively set the corresponding properties on the fixture result.
So, in this case, when the fixture script is executed we actually get 6 objects created.



== Using within Tests

Fixture scripts can be called from integration tests just the same way that fixture scripts can call one another.

For example, here's an integration test from the xref:simpleapp:ROOT:about.adoc[SimpleApp archetype]:

[source,java]
----
public class SimpleObjectIntegTest extends SimpleAppIntegTest {
    SimpleObject simpleObjectWrapped;
    @Before
    public void setUp() throws Exception {
        // given
        RecreateSimpleObjects fs =
             new RecreateSimpleObjects().setNumber(1);  // <1>
        fixtureScripts.runFixtureScript(fs, null);      // <2>

        SimpleObject simpleObjectPojo =
            fs.getSimpleObjects().get(0);               // <3>
        assertThat(simpleObjectPojo).isNotNull();

        simpleObjectWrapped = wrap(simpleObjectPojo);   // <4>
    }
    @Test
    public void accessible() throws Exception {
        // when
        final String name = simpleObjectWrapped.getName();
        // then
        assertThat(name).isEqualTo(fs.NAMES.get(0));
    }
    ...
    @Inject
    FixtureScripts fixtureScripts;                      // <5>
}
----
<1> instantiate the fixture script for this test, and configure
<2> execute the fixture script
<3> obtain the object under test from the fixture
<4> wrap the object (to simulate being interacted with through the UI)
<5> inject the `FixtureScripts` domain service (just like any other domain service)



== Personas and Builders

Good integration tests are probably the best way to understand the behaviour of the domain model: better, even, than reading the code itself.
This requires though that the tests are as minimal as possible so that the developer reading the test knows that everything mentioned in the test is essential to the functionality under test.

At the same time, "Persona" instances of entity classes help the developer become familiar with the data being set up.
For example, "Steve Single" the Customer might be 21, single and no kids, whereas vs "Meghan Married-Mum" the Customer might be married 35 with 2 kids.
Using "Steve" vs "Meghan" immediately informs the developer about the particular scenario being explored.

The `PersonaWithBuilderScript` and `PersonaWithFinder` interfaces are intended to be implemented typically by "persona" enums, where each enum instance captures the essential data of some persona.
So, going back to the previous example, we might have:

[source,xml]
----
public enum Customer_persona
        implements PersonaWithBuilderScript<..>, PersonaWithFinder<..> {

    SteveSingle("Steve", "Single", 21, MaritalStatus.SINGLE, 0)
    MeghanMarriedMum("Meghan", "Married-Mum", 35, MaritalStatus.MARRIED, 2);
    ...
}
----

The `PersonaWithBuilderScript` interface means that this enum is able to act as a factory for a `BuilderScriptAbstract`.
This is a specialization of `FixtureScript` that is used to actually create the entity (customer, or whatever), using the data taken out of the enum instance:

[source,xml]
----
public interface PersonaWithBuilderScript<T, F extends BuilderScriptAbstract<T,F>>  {
    F builder();
}
----

The `PersonaWithFinder` interface meanwhile indicates that the enum can "lookup" its corresponding entity from the appropriate repository domain service:

[source,xml]
----
public interface PersonaWithFinder<T> {
    T findUsing(final ServiceRegistry2 serviceRegistry);

}
----

The xref:simpleapp:ROOT:about.adoc[SimpleApp archetype] provides a sample implementation of these interfaces:

[source,java]
----
@lombok.AllArgsConstructor
public enum SimpleObject_persona
        implements PersonaWithBuilderScript<SimpleObject, SimpleObjectBuilder>,
                   PersonaWithFinder<SimpleObject> {
    FOO("Foo"),
    BAR("Bar"),
    BAZ("Baz"),
    FRODO("Frodo"),
    FROYO("Froyo"),
    FIZZ("Fizz"),
    BIP("Bip"),
    BOP("Bop"),
    BANG("Bang"),
    BOO("Boo");

    private final String name;

    @Override
    public SimpleObjectBuilder builder() {
        return new SimpleObjectBuilder().setName(name);
    }

    @Override
    public SimpleObject findUsing(final ServiceRegistry2 serviceRegistry) {
        SimpleObjectRepository simpleObjectRepository =
            serviceRegistry.lookupService(SimpleObjectRepository.class);
        return simpleObjectRepository.findByNameExact(name);
    }
}
----

where `SimpleObjectBuilder` in turn is:

[source,java]
----
@lombok.Accessors(chain = true)
public class SimpleObjectBuilder
            extends BuilderScriptAbstract<SimpleObject, SimpleObjectBuilder> {

    @lombok.Getter @lombok.Setter
    private String name;                                    // <1>

    @Override
    protected void execute(final ExecutionContext ec) {
        checkParam("name", ec, String.class);               // <2>
        object = wrap(simpleObjectMenu).create(name);
    }

    @lombok.Getter
    private SimpleObject object;                            // <3>

    @javax.inject.Inject
    SimpleObjectMenu simpleObjectMenu;
}
----
<1> The persona class should set this value (copied from its own state)
<2> the inherited "checkParam" is used to ensure that a value is set
<3> the created entity is provided as an output


This simplifies the integration tests considerably:

[source,java]
----
public class SimpleObject_IntegTest extends SimpleModuleIntegTestAbstract {

    SimpleObject simpleObject;

    @Before
    public void setUp() {
        // given
        simpleObject = fixtureScripts.runBuilderScript(SimpleObject_persona.FOO.builder());
    }

    @Test
    public void accessible() {
        // when
        final String name = wrap(simpleObject).getName();

        // then
        assertThat(name).isEqualTo(simpleObject.getName());
    }
    ...
}
----

Put together, the persona enums provide the "what" - hard-coded values for certain key data that the developer becomes very familiar with - while the builder provides the "how-to".

These builder scripts (`BuilderScriptAbstract` implementations) can be used independently of the enum personas.
And for more complex entity -where there might be many potential values that need to be provided
- the builder script can automatically default some or even all of these values.

For example, for a customer's date of birth, the buider could default to a date making the customer an adult, aged between 18 and 65, say.
For an email address or postal address, or an image, or some "lorem ipsum" text, the (non-ASF) link:https://platform.incode.org[Incode Platform^]'s fakedata module could provide randomised values.

The benefit of an intelligent builder is that it further simplifies the test.
The developer reading the test then knows that everything that has been specified exactly is of significance.
Because non-specified values are randomised and change on each run, it also decreases the chance that the test passes "by accident" (based on some lucky hard-coded input value).
