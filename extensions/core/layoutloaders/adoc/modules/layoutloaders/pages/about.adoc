The _LayoutLoaders_ module allows layouts to be read dynamically from an external repository, such as a source code repository.

It is intended as a development tool to allow layouts to be updated dynamically in an application running on an app server or in a container.

Currently only github is supported.

== GitHub

The GitHub implementation allows `.layout.xml` files to be loaded from github code repository.
The implementation searches for the file across the specified repository, and if found then returns it.

There are a couple of restrictions:

* the file name must be unique across the entire repository; the package structure is _not_ taken into account
* the file must reside on the default branch of the repository.

One workaround for the second restriction is to set up your own fork of your project repo, and make changes there.


[#dependencies]
=== Dependencies

In the webapp module of your application, add the following dependency:

[source,xml,subs="attributes+"]
.pom.xml
----
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.causeway.extensions</groupId>
        <artifactId>causeway-extensions-layoutloaders-github</artifactId>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
----


[#appmanifest]
=== AppManifest

In your application's `AppManifest` (top-level Spring `@Configuration` used to bootstrap the app), import the `CausewayModuleExtLayoutLoadersGitHub` module.

[source,java]
.AppManifest.java
----
@Configuration
@Import({
        ...
        CausewayModuleExtLayoutLoadersGitHub.class,
        ...
})
public class AppManifest {
}
----

[#configuration]
=== Configuration

Two configuration properties are required:

[source,yaml]
.application.yml
----
causeway:
  extensions:
    layout-loaders:
      github:
        api-key: ghp_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
        repository: apache/causeway-app-simpleapp
----


[#menubar-layout-xml]
=== menubar.layout.xml

The extension provides its own menu.
You can use `menubars.layout.xml` to arrange as you see fit, for example in the tertiary menu:

[source,xml]
.menubars.layout.xml
----
<mb:tertiary>
    <mb:menu>
        <mb:named/>
        <mb:section>
            <mb:named>Layouts</mb:named>
            <mb:serviceAction objectType="causeway.ext.layoutLoaders.LayoutLoadersGitHubMenu" id="enableDynamicLayoutLoading"/>
            <mb:serviceAction objectType="causeway.ext.layoutLoaders.LayoutLoadersGitHubMenu" id="disableDynamicLayoutLoading"/>
        </mb:section>
    </mb:menu>
    ...
</mb:tertiary>
----


== Usage

Once setup, the extension provides an "enableDynamicLayoutLoading" and "disableDynamicLayoutLoading" actions for the end-user to click on.
This returns a view model that allows the end-user to toggle dynamic loading on and off.
