     * returned can be limited so that they can be applied in batches.

     * case there will already be a {@link CommandLogEntry command} representing the
     * current high water mark on the secondary system.
     *
     * If the interactionId is not null but the corresponding
     * {@link CommandLogEntry command} is not found, then <tt>null</tt> is returned.
     * In the replay scenario the caller will probably interpret this as an
     * error because it means that the high water mark on the secondary is
     * inaccurate, referring to a non-existent {@link CommandLogEntry command} on
     * the primary.
