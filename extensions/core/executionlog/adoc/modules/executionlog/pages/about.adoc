The _Execution Log_ extension provides an implementation of xref:refguide:applib:index/services/publishing/spi/ExecutionSubscriber.adoc[ExecutionSubscriber] that persists xref:refguide:applib:index/services/iactn/Execution.adoc[Execution]s using either the xref:pjpa:ROOT:about.adoc[JPA/EclipseLink] or xref:pjdo:ROOT:about.adoc[JDO/DataNucleus] object store.


One use case is to combine with the xref:security:audittrail:about.adoc[] extension.
The _Command Log_ module logs the action invocations or property edits that the end-user makes, while the _audit trail_ logs the resultant changes in state to domain objects.
The two logs are correlated using the xref:refguide:applib:index/services/iactn/Interaction.adoc#getInteractionId_[interactionId] of the owning xref:refguide:applib:index/services/iactn/Interaction.adoc[interaction].

Sometimes the xref:commandlog:about.adoc[] extension is also configured with or instead of this extension; see the xref:#notes[notes] below to compare and contrast.


== Setup

=== Dependency Management

Add an entry for the _Execution Log_ module's own BOM:

[source,xml,subs="attributes+"]
.pom.xml
----
<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.apache.causeway.extensions</groupId>
            <artifactId>causeway-extensions-executionlog</artifactId>
            <scope>import</scope>
            <type>pom</type>
            <version>{page-causewayrel}</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
----

[#dependencies]
=== Dependencies

In the webapp module of your application, add the following dependency:

[source,xml]
.pom.xml
----
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.causeway.extensions</groupId>
        <artifactId>causeway-extensions-executionlog-persistence-XXX</artifactId>    <!--.-->
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
----
<.> specify either `causeway-extensions-executionlog-persistence-jpa` or `causeway-extensions-executionlog-persistence-jdo`, as required


[[_update-appmanifest]]
=== Update AppManifest

In your application's `AppManifest` (top-level Spring `@Configuration` used to bootstrap the app), import the _ExecutionLog_ modules.

[source,java]
.AppManifest.java
----
@Configuration
@Import({
        ...
        CausewayModuleExtExecutionLogPersistenceXxx.class,        // <.>
        ...
})
public class AppManifest {
}
----

<.> specify either `CausewayModuleExtExecutionLogPersistenceJdo` or `CausewayModuleExtExecutionLogPersistenceJpa`, as required

If using xref:security:secman:about.adoc[], you will also need to import the xref:testing:fixtures:about.adoc[Fixture] module; SecMan uses fixture scripts to seed its entities.

[#configure-properties]
=== Configuration Properties

Add the database schema used by the _Execution Log_ entities to the configuration file:

[source,yaml]
.application.yml
----
causeway:
  persistence:
    schema:
      auto-create-schemas: causewayExtExecutionLog
----

This extension currently does not though define any configuration properties of its own.


[#menubar-layout-xml]
=== menubar.layout.xml

Once configured, the extension provides a number of menu actions.
You can use `menubars.layout.xml` to arrange these as you see fit.
To get you started, the following fragment adds all of the actions to an "Activity" secondary menu:

[source,xml]
.menubars.layout.xml
----
<mb3:secondary>
    ...
    <mb3:menu>
        <mb3:named>Activity</mb3:named>
        ...
        <mb3:section>
            <mb3:named>Execution Log</mb3:named>
            <mb3:serviceAction id="findMostRecent" objectType="isis.ext.executionLog.ExecutionLogMenu"/>
            <mb3:serviceAction id="findExecutions" objectType="isis.ext.executionLog.ExecutionLogMenu"/>
            <mb3:serviceAction id="findAll" objectType="isis.ext.executionLog.ExecutionLogMenu"/>
        </mb3:section>
        ...
    </mb3:menu>
</mb3:secondary>
----


[#secman-security-roles]
=== SecMan Security Roles

If xref:security:secman:about.adoc[] extension is configured, then permissions must be granted to access the menu actions.

This can be done by granting the role set up by the xref:refguide:extensions:index/secman/applib/role/seed/CausewayExtExecutionLogRoleAndPermissions.adoc[] seed fixture script (see its `ROLE_NAME` constant).


== User Interface

The extension provides a number of menu actions and contributions.

The menu actions are as listed in xref:menubar-layout-xml[], above.
They allow the administrator to query the persisted commands.
Typically access to these actions would be restricted, see xref:secman-security-roles[security roles] above.

The extension also provides these mixins:

* xref:refguide:extensions:index/executionlog/applib/contributions/Object_recentExecutions.adoc[]
+
This contributes a `recentExecutions` collection to each and every domain object.
+
This can be explicit positioned through the domain class' own xref:userguide:fun:ui.adoc#object-layout[layout file], but this is generally not necessary: it will slot into the tab group in the layout file indicated for unreferenced collections using `<tabGroup unreferencedCollections="true">`.

* xref:refguide:extensions:index/executionlog/applib/contributions/HasUsername_recentExecutionsByUser.adoc[]
+
This contributes the `recentExecutionsByUser` collection to any domain object that implements the xref:refguide:applib:index/mixins/security/HasUsername.adoc[] interface.
+
Most notably, this is xref:security:secman:about.adoc[] extension's xref:refguide:extensions:index/secman/applib/user/dom/ApplicationUser.adoc[] entity that represents a logged-on user.
It is also supported by xref:security:sessionlog:about.adoc

* xref:refguide:extensions:index/executionlog/applib/contributions/HasInteractionId_executionLogEntries.adoc[]
+
This contributes the `executionLogEntries` property to any object implementing xref:refguide:applib:index/mixins/system/HasInteractionId.adoc[] interface.
Typically these are the entities persisted by the xref:commandlog:about.adoc[] or xref:security:audittrail:about.adoc[] extensions, making it easy to traverse between these logs.
