The _executionrepublisher_ module contributes an action to allow logged executions (as per the xref:userguide:executionlog:about.adoc[] module) to be republished to the outbox (as per the xref:userguide:executionoutbox:about.adoc[] modul).


== Setup

=== Dependency Management

Add an entry for the _Execution Republisher_ module's own BOM:

[source,xml,subs="attributes+"]
.pom.xml
----
<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.apache.causeway.extensions</groupId>
            <artifactId>causeway-extensions-executionrepublisher</artifactId>
            <scope>import</scope>
            <type>pom</type>
            <version>{page-causewayrel}</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
----

[#dependencies]
=== Dependencies

In the webapp module of your application, add the following dependency:

[source,xml]
.pom.xml
----
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.causeway.extensions</groupId>
        <artifactId>causeway-extensions-executionrepublisher-applib</artifactId>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

Note that this declares the xref:executionlog:about.adoc[] and xref:executionoutbox:about.adoc[] modules as dependencies.

[[_update-appmanifest]]
=== Update AppManifest

In your application's `AppManifest` (top-level Spring `@Configuration` used to bootstrap the app), import the _ExecutionLog_ modules.

[source,java]
.AppManifest.java
----
@Configuration
@Import({
        ...
        CausewayModuleExtExecutionRepublisherApplib.class,
        ...
})
public class AppManifest {
}
----

Note that this expects (and depends upon) the xref:executionlog:about.adoc[] and xref:executionoutbox:about.adoc[] modules.


== User Interface

The extension provides this mixins:

* xref:refguide:extensions:index/executionrepublisher/applib/contributions/ExecutionLogEntry_copyToOutbox.adoc[]
+
This contributes a `copyToOutbox` action to the xref:refguide:extensions:index/executionlog/applib/dom/ExecutionLogEntry.adoc[] entity.
