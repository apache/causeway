== Setup

=== Dependency Management

Add an entry for the _Execution Republisher_ module's own BOM:

[source,xml,subs="attributes+"]
.pom.xml
----
<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.apache.causeway.extensions</groupId>
            <artifactId>causeway-extensions-executionrepublisher</artifactId>
            <scope>import</scope>
            <type>pom</type>
            <version>{page-causewayreleaseversion}</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
----

=== Dependencies / Import

In the webapp module of your application, add the following dependency:

[source,xml]
.pom.xml
----
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.causeway.extensions</groupId>
        <artifactId>causeway-extensions-executionrepublisher-applib</artifactId>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

Note that this declares the xref:executionlog:about.adoc[] and xref:executionoutbox:about.adoc[] modules as dependencies.


In your application's xref:userguide::modules.adoc#appmanifest[App Manifest], import the _ExecutionRepublisher_ module.

[source,java]
.AppManifest.java
----
@Configuration
@Import({
        ...
        CausewayModuleExtExecutionRepublisherApplib.class,
        ...
})
public class AppManifest {
}
----

Note that this depends upon the xref:executionlog:about.adoc[] and xref:executionoutbox:about.adoc[] modules.
