  <section>
    <title>Preface</title>

    <para>This manual describes how to develop applications to run with the
    [[NAME]] framework, from simple prototypes to enterprise
    systems.</para>

    <para>You can download [[NAME]] via <ulink url="isis.apache.org">isis.apache.org</ulink>, or direct from
    <ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/projects/isis/">SourceForge</ulink>,
    under an open source licence.</para>

    <para>This edition of the manual is intended for use with version 4 of the
    [[NAME]] framework, which works with Java version 1.5 or
    higher.</para>

    <note>
      <para>Please note that the Hibernate plugin is not available in version
      4.0, although it should be available in a subsequent release. Therefore,
      the sections of this manual that talk about Hibernate are not relevant
      at this time.</para>

    <title>Introduction</title>

    <partintro>
      <para>This part of the documentation aims at getting you started with
      [[NAME]] in a short space of time. It cover basic installation,
      building applications, running them and then an overview of how they
      actually work. The next part of the manual then goes into each of these
      areas in more detail.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Installing [[NAME]]</title>

        <para>Before we launch into using and developing [[NAME]] you
        need to have the [[NAME]] binary distribuion installed. This is
        covered in this section if you have not already installed it. There
        are other ways of building and running [[NAME]], but these are
        covered in the next part of this manual.</para>

        <section>
          <title>Prerequisites</title>

          <para>To build and run [[NAME]] applications for this tutorial
          you need Java version 1.5<footnote>
              <para>Download from <ulink type="" url="http://java.sun.com/">http://java.sun.com/</ulink></para>
            </footnote> or above and Ant 1.7<footnote>
              <para>Download from <ulink url="http://ant.apache.org/">http://ant.apache.org/</ulink></para>
            </footnote> installed on your machine.</para>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>Downloading the framework</title>

          <para>The latest version of the [[NAME]] framework can be
          downloaded from the downloads page of the [[NAME]] Sourceforge
          project<footnote>
              <para>See <ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/projects/isis/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/isis/</ulink></para>
            </footnote> as shown below. For this tutorial you should download
          the binary release (suffixed with '-for-ant' ) for immediate use.
          (There are three other versions available, suffixed '-for-maven'
          '-source', and '-libs-only-with-dependencies'. You can ignore these
          for now.</para>

          no need to create a directory in which to install everything). As an
          example here is the compressed tar file being extracted</para>

      <section>
        <title>Running the Expenses demo application</title>

        <para>The [[NAME]] distribution comes with a demonstration
        application for expenses processing i.e. for creating, submitting and
        approving expense claims. The application has only limited
        functionality - a real expenses processing application would require
        many more features - but what it has is realistic in terms of
        implementation.</para>

        <para>There are two ways in which you can run the demonstration: as a
        standalone executable, or building it and running it from within a
        development environment. This chapter covers the former approach and
        looks at how a [[NAME]] application is used, while the next
        chapter looks at building and modifying the example allowing you to
        browse and modify the source code.</para>

        <para>The files for running the demo can be found in the
        <filename moreinfo="none">demo/expenses</filename> directory, while the source code
        and build files are in the <filename moreinfo="none">examples/expenses</filename>
        directory.</para>

        <section>
          <title>Running with the Drag and Drop user interface</title>

          <para>The executable version of the Expenses demo application exists
          within the <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">demos</filename> directory of the [[NAME]]
          distribution.</para>

          
            <screeninfo/>

            </mediaobject>
          

          <para>Run the batch file <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">ExpensesDND.bat</filename> file either by
          double-clicking on the icon (in Windows) or using the following
          commands on the command line. In Windows the commands are</para>

          <programlisting format="linespecific">&gt; cd demos\expenses 
&gt; ExpensesDND.bat</programlisting>

          <para>while on the Mac or when using Unix/Linux they are:</para>

          <programlisting format="linespecific">$ cd demos/expenses 
$ ./ExpensesDND.sh</programlisting>

          <para>After seeing the [[NAME]] splash screen, you'll be
          presented with a Login screen:</para>

          
            <mediaobject>

              </imageobject>
            </mediaobject>
          

          <para>Log in as 'sven' and a password of 'pass'. The application
          will then open like this:</para>

              </imageobject>
            </mediaobject>
          

          <para>When an application is started an application window is opened
          and the user's services are displayed on the left hand side. These
          icons typically give the user access to the domain objects held and
          used by the system, and provide a way for to create new instances.
          Any other object that subsequently appears on the screen represents
          one of those domain objects.</para>

          <remark>TODO replace with up-to-date shot using current
          example</remark>

          <para>The service and objects can be manipulated as follows:</para>

            <listitem>
              <para>Object actions can be invoked by
              <emphasis>right-clicking</emphasis> on an icon and selecting one

              <para>To inspect an object (when only an icon is shown)

              the object in a new window.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Objects can be dragged by
              <emphasis>click-dragging</emphasis> on an icon and dropped by
              releasing the mouse button.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Dragged objects can be dropped on to an empty object field
              (identified by the grey hole; the label to the right of the hole
              specifies what type of object can be dropped). If the object can
              be dropped into that field then it will flash green. If the
              object cannot be dropped - either because it is the wrong type
              or that specific object is disallowed for some other reason -
              then the field will flash red. Dropping an object into a field
              sets up that field, effectively associating the two
              objects.</para>

            <listitem>
              <para>Dragged objects can be dropped onto other object icons. If

              object then it will flash green. If that object does not accept
              that kind of object, or disallows that specific object, then it
              will flash red. Dropping one object onto another invokes a
              specific object action, for example: add this product to that

$ ./ExpensesHTML.sh</programlisting>

          <para>Allowing a few seconds for the application to start up, you
          then need to launch a browser and point it to <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">http://localhost:8080/logon.app</filename> and

          top. In the same ways as for DND these links give the user access to
          the objects held and used by the system and provide a way to create
          new objects. Any other object that subsequently appears on the
          screen represents one of those objects.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Understanding how a [[NAME]] application works</title>

      <para>[[NAME]] creates the user interface for an application
      directly from the definitions of the domain model. In this section we
      will look at that relationship in more detail, with reference to the
      Expenses Processing example application supplied as part of the
      download. As we showed in the previous section, any domain model written
      for [[NAME]] may be run with any of the viewers - there is no
      specific coding required, and the domain model has no knowledge of which
      viewer is being used. However, each viewer will have different gestures
      or mechanisms for providing the same functionality. To illustrate this,
      we will show the same objects being accessed through both the DND and
      the HTML viewers, side by side.</para>

      <para>The application code for the Expenses Processing example, like any
      [[NAME]] application, consists of two things: domain objects and
      services. The domain objects form the lion's share of that code, so
      we'll look at how those work first.</para>

      <para>The code for examples we will be looking at can be found in the
      directory <filename moreinfo="none">examples/expenses/expenses-dom/src</filename> in the
      downloaded files.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Domain objects</title>

        <para>The domain objects are the entities - the nouns - that represent
        the application domain: employee, claim, expense item, project code,
        currency, and so forth. In the course of using the application, a user
        will view and manipulate many instances of these domain objects. To
        understand how [[NAME]] handles domain objects, we'll start by
        looking at an Employee object:</para>

        
          <mediaobject>
            <imageobject>
              <imagedata contentwidth="40%" fileref="images/employee-views.png" format="PNG"/>
            </imageobject>
          </mediaobject>
        

        <para>Every object presented in the user interface will have a
        corresponding Java class in the domain model - in this case it is
        <literal>org.apache.isis.example.expenses.employee.Employee</literal>.
        Below we can see the code for the <literal>Employee</literal>
        object, as presented in Eclipse, with the object's list of methods
        presented on the left hand side.</para>

        
          <mediaobject>
            <imageobject>
              <imagedata contentwidth="40%" fileref="images/employee-code.png" format="PNG"/>
            </imageobject>
          </mediaobject>
        

        <para>The first thing to note is that the type of the object as shown
        in the user views is derived directly from the class name in Java. The
        framework inserts spaces before capital letters, so that the class
        <literal>TemporaryEmployee</literal> would be presented to the
        user as 'Temporary Employee'. However we will see later that the name
        may be over-ridden where necessary, for example if we want the name to
        include punctuation or other characters not allowed in Java class
        names. (Note that there is a separate mechanism for dealing with
        internationalisation).</para>

        <para>Secondly, we can see that <literal>Employee</literal>
        extends <literal>AbstractDomainObject</literal> - a class provided
        within the [[NAME]] application library. This is not a
        requirement: your domain objects may be Plain Old Java Objects (POJOs)
        - they do not need to extend any class in the framework. However,
        extending from <literal moreinfo="none">AbstractDomainObject</literal>
        will save us having to write a few lines of code in each case, as
        we'll see later.</para>

        <para>Note also that in the body of the object we use 'code folding'
        (the plug-in used here is <ulink url="http://www.realjenius.com/platform_support">Coffee Bytes</ulink>)
        to break the object's code into regions, each typically containing one
        or more related methods that together fulfill a high-level
        responsibility of the object. This is just a coding convention, not a
        requirement.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Properties</title>

        <para>In both of the user views of an Employee we can see a field
        called 'Name'. Within the <literal>Employee</literal> class there
        is a <literal moreinfo="none">Name</literal> region of code, expanded
        here:</para>

        <programlisting condition="" format="linespecific">// {{ Name
    private String name;

    @MemberOrder(sequence="1")
    @Disabled
    public String getName() {
        return this.name;
    }
    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
// }}</programlisting>

        <para>The <literal moreinfo="none">Name</literal> region contains a
        simple property, of type <literal moreinfo="none">String</literal>,
        defined by a <literal moreinfo="none">getName</literal> and a <literal moreinfo="none">setName</literal> method. This is sufficient
        information to allow the viewers to display a field containing a
        textual value. Note that if the property is to be persisted, then it
        will need both a <literal moreinfo="none">get</literal> and a <literal moreinfo="none">set</literal> method - per the standard JavaBeans
        convention. If you wish to display a field that is derived
        automatically from other information in the object, and do not require
        this to be persisted, then a <literal moreinfo="none">get</literal>
        alone will suffice.</para>

        <para>As with the name of the object, the field name is derived
        automatically from the name of the property - though we'll see later
        that this may be over-ridden if needed.</para>

        <para>The <literal moreinfo="none">getName</literal> has been marked
        up with two Java annotations, both defined in the [[NAME]]
        application library. Annotations allow the programmer to enrich the
        information available to the framework. On properties, any [[NAME]]
        Objects annotations are always associated with the <literal moreinfo="none">get</literal> method. However, annotations are not
        mandatory - you can write a simple [[NAME]] application without
        using any annotations at all.</para>

        <para>By default, any property with both a <literal moreinfo="none">get</literal> and <literal moreinfo="none">set</literal> method will be editable by the user.
        <literal moreinfo="none">@Disabled</literal> tells the framework that
        this particular property may never be altered by the user (though it
        may be altered programmatically). Later we'll see how to make a
        property modifiable on certain conditions.</para>

        <para><literal moreinfo="none">@MemberOrder(sequence="1")
        </literal>tells the framework that this property should be the first
        field displayed in any view of the Employee - irrespective of where it
        is defined within the code. This ordering information has been
        observed by both the viewers.</para>

        <para>The next region of the code contains another <literal moreinfo="none">String</literal> property, called <literal moreinfo="none">UserName</literal>:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">// {{ UserName field
    private String userName;

    @Hidden
    public String getUserName() {
        return userName;
    }
    public void setUserName(final String variable) {
        this.userName = variable;
    }
// }}</programlisting>

        <para>Note that <literal moreinfo="none">getUserName</literal> has
        been marked up with <literal moreinfo="none">@Hidden</literal>. This
        tells the framework that this property should never be shown in user
        views of the object (check this against the two user views above).
        Later on we'll see how it is possible to hide a property in certain
        circumstances.</para>

        <para>Next we'll look at the <literal moreinfo="none">EmailAddress</literal> region:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">// {{ EmailAddress
    private String emailAddress;
    
    @MemberOrder(sequence = "2")
    @Optional
    @RegEx(validation = "(\\w+\\.)*\\w+@(\\w+\\.)+[A-Za-z]+")
    public String getEmailAddress() {
        return this.emailAddress;
    }
    public void setEmailAddress(final String emailAddress) {
        this.emailAddress = emailAddress;
    }
    public void modifyEmailAddress(final String emailAddress) {
        getRecordActionService().recordFieldChange(this, "Email Address", getEmailAddress(), emailAddress);
        setEmailAddress(emailAddress);
    }
    public void clearEmailAddress() {
        getRecordActionService().recordFieldChange(this, "Email Address", getEmailAddress(), "EMPTY");
        setEmailAddress(null);
    }
    public boolean hideEmailAddress() {
        return !employeeIsCurrentUser();
    }
    private boolean employeeIsCurrentUser() {
        return getUserFinder().currentUserAsObject() == this;
    }
// }}</programlisting>

        <para>As well as <literal moreinfo="none">@MemberOrder</literal>, this
        property is marked up with <literal moreinfo="none">@Optional</literal> and <literal moreinfo="none">@RegEx</literal> annotations. By default, all
        properties are taken to be mandatory - if the user creates or edits an
        object then they will be required to specify the contents of each
        field. <literal moreinfo="none">@Optional</literal> overrides this
        default behaviour - indicating here that the object may be saved
        without an email address.</para>

        <para><literal moreinfo="none">@RegEx</literal> is applicable only to
        <literal moreinfo="none">String</literal> properties. In this case the
        annotation specifies a Regular Expression that will be used to
        validate any value that the user types into the field. In a
        conventional architecture, this functionality would typically be found
        in the user interface code. The [[NAME]] argument is that this
        functionality should apply to any user interface that might want to
        change the property, so its proper place is in the object. <literal moreinfo="none">@RegEx</literal> may also be used to reformat a String
        that has been entered by the user.</para>

        <para>The two screens below show how two different viewers make use of
        the functionality in different ways. In both cases the user has typed
        in a value that does not match the RegEx specification (they have
        typed in an email address that contains a space), so the new value has
        not been accepted or saved.</para>

        
          <mediaobject>
            <imageobject>
              <imagedata contentwidth="40%" fileref="images/employee-email-invalid.png" format="PNG"/>
            </imageobject>
          </mediaobject>
        

        <para>In addition to <literal moreinfo="none">getEmailAddress</literal> and <literal moreinfo="none">setEmailAddress</literal>, there are <literal moreinfo="none">modifyEmailAddress</literal>, <literal moreinfo="none">clearEmailAddress</literal> and <literal moreinfo="none">hideEmailAddress</literal> methods. [[NAME]]
        recognises the <literal moreinfo="none">modify</literal>, <literal moreinfo="none">clear</literal> and <literal moreinfo="none">hide</literal> prefixes (and a few others that we
        shall see later) as specifying additional functionality relating to
        the <literal moreinfo="none">EmailAddress</literal> property.</para>

        <para>If a property has a corresponding <literal moreinfo="none">modify&lt;propertyName&gt;</literal> method, then
        whenever the user modifies the field, this will be called rather than
        the <literal moreinfo="none">set</literal>. In this case the <literal moreinfo="none">modify</literal> method uses the <literal moreinfo="none">RecordActionService</literal> to record the details of
        the change, and then calls <literal moreinfo="none">setEmailAddress</literal> to change the value. The
        reason for adopting this pattern, rather than including the
        functionality in the <literal moreinfo="none">set</literal> itself, is
        that the <literal moreinfo="none">set</literal> will be called by the
        object store each time the object is retrieved. So we use a <literal moreinfo="none">modify</literal> method where we want to do something
        (such as add to a total) only when the user changes a field.</para>

        <para><literal moreinfo="none">clearEmailAddress</literal> is called,
        in a similar manner, if the user clears the contents of the field.
        Again, it is optional - added where we want to perform some logic only
        when the user clears the property. On the <literal moreinfo="none">UserName</literal> field we saw that <literal moreinfo="none">@Hidden</literal> hides a property from the user
        permanently. We may, however, want to hide fields under certain
        circumstances. The visibility of all classes, properties and methods
        may be controlled via conventional authorization techniques, based on
        the user's role(s). In rarer cases, we want to control visibility at
        an instance level. In this case, for privacy reasons we do not want
        the email address to be visible, except to that person. This is what
        the <literal moreinfo="none">hideEmailAddress()</literal>method is
        doing. If the method returns true, the field will be hidden from the
        user.</para>

        <para>Next we will look at the <literal moreinfo="none">NormalApprover</literal> region:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">// {{ NormalApprover
    private Employee normalApprover;
    
    @MemberOrder(sequence="4")
    public Employee getNormalApprover() {
        return this.normalApprover;
    }
    public void setNormalApprover(final Employee normalAuthoriser) {
        this.normalApprover = normalAuthoriser;
    }
    public void modifyNormalApprover(final Employee normalAuthoriser) {
        getRecordActionService().recordFieldChange(this, "Normal Approver", getNormalApprover(), normalApprover);
        setNormalApprover(normalAuthoriser);
    }
    public void clearNormalApprover() {
        getRecordActionService().recordFieldChange(this, "Normal Approver", getNormalApprover(), "EMPTY");
        setNormalApprover(null);
    }
    public String validateNormalApprover(Employee newApprover) {
        return newApprover == this ? CANT_BE_APPROVER_FOR_OWN_CLAIMS: null;
    }
    public String disableNormalApprover() {
        return employeeIsCurrentUser() ? null: NOT_MODIFIABLE;
    }
    
    public static final String NOT_MODIFIABLE = "Not modifiable by current user";
    public static final String CANT_BE_APPROVER_FOR_OWN_CLAIMS = "Can't be the approver for your own claims";
// }}</programlisting>

        <para>The <literal moreinfo="none">NormalApprover</literal> property
        takes an object of type <literal moreinfo="none">Employee</literal>.
        Assuming that this field is not disabled, the user may specify an
        Employee object for this field. [[NAME]] will prevent the user
        from trying to associate the wrong type of object with this field.
        This is illustrated in the two screens below:</para>

        
          <mediaobject>
            <imageobject>
              <imagedata contentwidth="40%" fileref="images/employee-approver-views.png" format="PNG"/>
            </imageobject>
          </mediaobject>
        

        <para>In the left-hand screen (DND) we can see the user dropping an
        Employee object into the empty field, and the field is flashing green
        to indicate that this will succeed. If the user attempted to drop
        another type of object into the empty field, then the field would
        flash red, and the drop would not update the field. A successful drop
        will call the <literal moreinfo="none">set</literal> method, or, if a
        <literal moreinfo="none">modify&lt;propertyName&gt;</literal> method
        is provided (as it is here), it will call that instead. Note that on
        the DND viewer, if a field already contains an object, then this may
        be cleared by right-clicking on that object and selecting 'Clear
        Association'. This will set the property to <literal moreinfo="none">null</literal>. If there is a <literal moreinfo="none">clear&lt;propertyName&gt;</literal> field (as there is
        in this example) then that will be called rather than the <literal moreinfo="none">set</literal> method. Alternatively a new reference
        can be dropped on to the field's label, which combines both the
        clearing and the subsequent setting of the field.</para>

        <para>In the HTML viewer (right-hand screen) drag and drop is not
        possible. In a reference field such as this one, the user will be
        given a drop-down list of objects of the appropriate type (i.e.
        Employees here) that the user has recently viewed. If the required
        Employee object is not in that list then the user may go and find that
        object (e.g. from the Employees tab) and then return to the context -
        this time the newly viewed Employee will have been added to the list
        automatically. (Note: This is a generic capability provided by the
        HTML viewer. In other contexts, the programmer may want to specify an
        explicit list of objects to appear in a drop-down list. This would be
        achieved by means of a <literal moreinfo="none">choices&lt;propertyName&gt;</literal> method).</para>

        <para>The <literal moreinfo="none">validateNormalApprover</literal>
        method enforces any rules concerning the specific instances of
        <literal moreinfo="none">Employee</literal> that may be associated
        with this field. In this particular example, it prevents the user from
        specifying an Employee as their own approver. Note that this method
        returns a <literal moreinfo="none">String</literal>. If the specific
        Employee instance being passed into the method is acceptable, the
        method should return <literal moreinfo="none">null</literal>; if
        unacceptable then the method should return a <literal moreinfo="none">String</literal> message that will be made available
        to the user to advise them why the action will not succeed. (On the
        DND this appears at the bottom of the screen.)</para>

        <para>The <literal moreinfo="none">disableNormalApprover</literal>
        method prevents the user from modifying the field in certain
        circumstances. In this example the method enforces the rule that only
        the Employee themselves may change this field. Like the <literal moreinfo="none">validate</literal> method, it returns a <literal moreinfo="none">null</literal> if the user may modify the field
        (subject to the validate rules), or returns a <literal moreinfo="none">String</literal> message if they may not. (Note that
        this method, along with hide (seen earlier) allow for 'instance-based
        authorization'. Most applications can manage with 'class-based
        authorization' - in which the classes, properties and actions made
        available to a user are based on their roles. Class-based
        authorization in [[NAME]] is administered externally to the
        application and does not require any coding within the domain
        objects.)</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Title</title>

        <para>In the next screen we will look at the <literal moreinfo="none">title</literal> region of the Employee object.</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">// {{ Title
    public String title() {
        return getName();
    }
// }}</programlisting>

        <para>The <literal moreinfo="none">title</literal> method specifies
        the title for the object - which, on both the DND and HTML viewers
        appears next to the icon. The title is there to help the user identify
        objects. [[NAME]] also provides an easy mechanism to retrieve
        objects from the object store by their title. Other methods of
        finding/searching may require repository methods to be written. If no
        <literal moreinfo="none">title</literal> method is specified, [[NAME]]
        Objects will use the object's <literal moreinfo="none">toString</literal> method as a title. Titles are
        usually based on one or more of the persisted properties - in this
        case on the Name. When constructing a title from multiple elements,
        the [[NAME]] application library provides a helper object:
        <literal>TitleBuffer</literal>.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Actions</title>

        <para>The screen below shows the action menu for the Taxi object, as
        rendered by the two different user interfaces:</para>

        
          <mediaobject>
            <imageobject>
              <imagedata contentwidth="40%" fileref="images/taxi-menu.png" format="PNG"/>
            </imageobject>
          </mediaobject>
        

        <para>By default, any <literal moreinfo="none">public</literal>
        instance methods on an object, included inherited public methods, will
        be rendered as a user-action. The exceptions to this rule are:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Any methods that are recognised by [[NAME]] as having a
            specific intent. We've seen a number of these already, including
            <literal moreinfo="none">get</literal> and <literal moreinfo="none">set</literal> methods, <literal moreinfo="none">title</literal>, and the methods prefixed by
            <literal moreinfo="none">modify</literal>, <literal moreinfo="none">clear</literal>, <literal moreinfo="none">validate</literal>, <literal moreinfo="none">disable</literal> and so on. There is a full list
            of recognised methods included in the section <xref linkend="recognised-methods"/>.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Any methods that the programmer has specified should be
            hidden from the user, either statically with <literal moreinfo="none">@Hidden</literal>, or dynamically with a <literal moreinfo="none">hide&lt;methodName&gt;</literal> method.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para><literal moreinfo="none">private</literal>, <literal moreinfo="none">protected</literal>, and <literal moreinfo="none">static</literal> methods are ignored by [[NAME]]
        Objects.</para>

        <para>For example, the action 'Copy From' on the Taxi object, is
        derived from this method on the
        <literal>AbstractExpenseItem</literal> class (from which
        <literal>Taxi</literal> inherits):</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">    @MemberOrder(sequence="5")
    public void copyFrom(final ExpenseItem otherItem) {
        if (belongsToSameClaim(otherItem)) {
            if (dateIncurred == null) {
                modifyDateIncurred(otherItem.getDateIncurred());
            }
        } else if (getClass().isInstance(otherItem)) {
            copyAllSameClassFields(otherItem);
        }
    }</programlisting>

        <para>Again, we can see that the method has been marked up with
        <literal moreinfo="none">@MemberOrder</literal>, which will govern the
        relative location of this action on the action menu.</para>

        <para>Because the <literal moreinfo="none">copyFrom</literal> method
        takes a parameter, when the user invokes the corresponding menu action
        they will be presented with a dialog, wherein each of the parameters
        may be specified. This is shown below on the two user
        interfaces:</para>

        
          <mediaobject>
            <imageobject>
              <imagedata contentwidth="40%" fileref="images/taxi-copy-dialog.png" format="PNG"/>
            </imageobject>
          </mediaobject>
        

        <para>Editing a dialog is similar to editing an object: though there
        are differences in the way they are rendered (for example a dialog has
        an 'OK' button in both the DND and HTML user interfaces). Parameters
        that take value types (such as <literal>String</literal> or
        <literal>Date</literal>) are rendered as fields that the user can
        type into. Where a parameter is a domain object class or interface, as
        in this case with <literal>ExpenseItem</literal>, then the user
        must specify an object of that type. In the DND user interface, the
        user may drag and drop an object into the parameter field. In the HTML
        user interface, the user is automatically presented with a drop-down
        list of objects of that type that they have recently viewed. If the
        desired object doesn't appear, they may go and find the object (by
        navigating from another object, or using a find method on one of the
        start points) and then return to the dialog, where the
        recently-located object should now appear on the list.</para>

        <para>Adjacent to the <literal moreinfo="none">copyFrom</literal>
        method on <literal>AbstractExpenseItem</literal> we can also find
        the following two methods:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">    public String disableCopyFrom() {
        return disabledIfLocked();
    }

    public String validateCopyFrom(final ExpenseItem otherItem) {
        if (belongsToSameClaim(otherItem) || (getClass().equals(otherItem.getClass()))) {
            return null;
        }
        return COPY_WARN;
    }
    private final static String COPY_WARN = "Cannot copy";</programlisting>

        <para><literal moreinfo="none">disableCopyFrom</literal> and <literal moreinfo="none">validateCopyFrom</literal> are other examples of
        recognised methods (see <xref linkend="recognised-methods"/>). They
        work in a similar manner to the <literal moreinfo="none">disable&lt;propertyName&gt;</literal> and <literal moreinfo="none">validate&lt;propertyName&gt;</literal> methods that we
        have previously seen - in this case disabling the action under certain
        conditions, and validating the parameters of the action. For both the
        user-interfaces shown, disabling the action will result in it being
        greyed-out on the menu. If the entered set of parameters does not pass
        the validity test, this will be brought to the user's attention when
        they attempt to execute the action (e.g. by hitting the OK button),
        along with an explanatory message.</para>

        <para>By default, the user will be required to specify each of the
        parameters within the dialog. The programmer may, however, use the
        <literal moreinfo="none">@Optional </literal>annotation in-line (i.e.
        immediately before any parameter in the method signature) to specify
        that that parameter may be left empty.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Defining Services</title>

        <para>As stated previously all the application code consists either of
        domain objects or services, with the former typically representing the
        lions share of the code. Now we'll look at the services.</para>

        <para>Services perform two roles in a [[NAME]] application.
        First, they provide a place to put functionality that cannot be placed
        on an instance of a domain object, of which the two most obvious
        examples are:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Finding one or more domain objects where you don't have an
            associated object to navigate from e.g. finding a Customer object
            by their name or customer number.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Creating a new instance of a domain object class, where you
            don't have an existing object to create it from. Thus, although
            you might decide that it makes sense to create a new Order object
            by means of an action on Customer, you will probably want to be
            able to create a new Customer object without necessarily having
            any Order.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>To fulfill these requirements we could create two separate
        services, called, say, CustomerFinder and CustomerFactory. Or we could
        create a single service called, say, Customers, which has methods to
        cover both requirements. There's no hard-and-fast rule about how
        services should be partitioned.</para>

        <para>The second role that services perform within a [[NAME]]
        application is to bridge domains. The following are examples of what
        we mean by bridging domains:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Linking to functionality that already exists, or has to
            exist, outside of the [[NAME]] application, such as
            pre-existing services, or functionality within legacy
            systems.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Bridging between technical domains, such as between the
            object domain and the relational database domain, or the email
            domain.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>(Less commonly) Bridging between isolated modelling domains.
            The [[NAME]] philosophy is to aim, where possible, for a
            single coherent enterprise object model running within the same
            application space. Where this is not possible (e.g. for technical
            or for political reasons), then services may be used to
            communicate between the domains without requiring common object
            definitions and/or identities.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>In this section we'll look at how services are defined, and in
        the next section at how they are used.</para>

        <para>Services are implemented as Java classes, as are domain objects,
        but they are handled differently by the framework.</para>

        <para>It is good practice to define services as Java interfaces. That
        way it is possible for the implementation of the service to change
        over time, without affecting any of the objects that use the service.
        During development it is often useful to develop a simple 'mock'
        implementation of a service that can be used either for prototyping or
        testing purposes; this can then be replaced with a proper
        implementation as development progresses towards deployment. For
        example, within the Expenses Processing application, the following
        Java interface defines a service for sending an email:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">    package org.apache.isis.example.expenses.services;

    public interface EmailSender {

        void sendTextEmail(final String toEmailAddress, final String text);
    }</programlisting>

        <para>This service definition has just one method, but it could easily
        have more, such as methods that take a <literal moreinfo="none">List</literal> of recipient addresses, or that can
        accommodate file attachments. <literal moreinfo="none">JavaMailSender</literal> is an implementation of that
        service:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">public class JavaMailSender extends AbstractService implements EmailSender {

    private static final String SMTP_HOST_NAME = "localhost";
    private static final String SMTP_AUTH_USER = "expenses@donotreply.org";
    private static final String SMTP_AUTH_PWD = "";
    private static final boolean authenticate = false;

    private class SMTPAuthenticator extends javax.mail.Authenticator {
        public PasswordAuthentication getPasswordAuthentication() {
            final String username = SMTP_AUTH_USER;
            final String password = SMTP_AUTH_PWD;
            return new PasswordAuthentication(username, password);
        }
    }

    public void sendTextEmail(final String toEmailAddress, final String text) {
        try {
            final Properties properties = new Properties();
            properties.put("mail.smtp.host", SMTP_HOST_NAME);
            properties.put("mail.smtp.auth", authenticate ? "true" : "false");
            final Authenticator authenticator = authenticate ? new SMTPAuthenticator() : null;
            final Session session = Session.getDefaultInstance(properties, authenticator);
            final Message message = new MimeMessage(session);
            final InternetAddress fromAddress = new InternetAddress(SMTP_AUTH_USER);
            final InternetAddress toAddress = new InternetAddress(toEmailAddress);
            message.setFrom(fromAddress);
            message.setRecipient(Message.RecipientType.TO, toAddress);
            message.setSubject("Expenses notification");
            message.setContent(text, "text/plain");
            Transport.send(message);
        } catch (AddressException e) {
            throw new ApplicationException("Invalid email address", e);
        } catch (MessagingException e) {
            throw new ApplicationException("Problem sending email", e);
        }
    }
}</programlisting>

        <para>We can see that this service performs a technical bridging role:
        it bridges between the object domain and an external SMTP
        server.</para>

        <para>Since there could be multiple implementations of any one service
        within our code base, [[NAME]] needs to be informed of which
        services it is to reference when running an application. This is done
        within the properties files. For example, the <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">isis.properties</filename>
        file, which may be found within the <literal moreinfo="none">expenses.app.client\config</literal> directory,
        contains the property specification:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">isis.services.prefix=org.apache.isis.example.expenses
isis.services=services.JavaMailSender</programlisting>

        <para>This specifies that the class JavaMailSender is to be referenced
        as a service within the application. You will find a list of other
        services being referenced there also. Many of those services are
        'repositories', and though there is no technical difference between a
        repository and any other kind of service, repositories play such an
        important role in [[NAME]] applications, that they are worth
        exploring in more detail.</para>

        <section>
          <title>Repositories</title>

          <para>[[NAME]] handles the basic object lifecycle (create,
          read, update, delete) automatically - there is no need to define
          your own methods for saving or updating objects, or for retrieving
          an object that you have a reference to. These mechanisms work the
          same way irrespective of what technology you are using to persist
          the objects - such as via Hibernate, natively to a relational
          database, or via the 'XML Object Store'.</para>

          <para>[[NAME]] even provides some simple mechanisms for
          searching for persisted objects - that also operate the same way,
          irrespective of the object store. However, a business application
          will also need more complex search queries that, for reasons of
          efficiency, will need to be written specifically for the type of
          object store you are working with.</para>

          <para>Best practice in application design suggests that such queries
          should be implemented on 'Repository' classes, rather than within
          the domain classes directly. That way if you change the persistent
          object store, you can just create a new implementation of the
          affected Repositories, without having to change any domain classes.
          [[NAME]] supports this concept. Within the Expenses application
          you will find the following three repository definitions:</para>

          <programlisting format="linespecific">org.apache.isis.example.expenses.claims.ClaimRepository
org.apache.isis.example.expenses.employee.EmployeeRepository;
org.apache.isis.example.expenses.recordedAction.impl.RecordedActionRepository;</programlisting>

          <para>In each case the repository is defined as a Java interface,
          anticipating the possibility of different implementations. We'll
          look at the <literal>ClaimRepository</literal>
          definition:</para>

          <programlisting format="linespecific">public interface ClaimRepository {
    final static int MAX_CLAIMS = 20;
    final static int MAX_ITEMS = 10;

    List&lt;Claim&gt; findClaims(final Employee employee, final ClaimStatus status, final String description);

    List&lt;Claim&gt; findRecentClaims(final Employee employee);

    boolean descriptionIsUniqueForClaimant(final Employee employee, final String initialDescription);

    List&lt;ExpenseItem&gt; findExpenseItemsLike(final ExpenseItem item);

    List&lt;Claim&gt; findClaimsAwaitingApprovalBy(Employee approver);
    
    ClaimStatus findClaimStatus(String title);

    ExpenseItemStatus findExpenseItemStatus(String title);
}</programlisting>

          <para>This interface defines some seven method signatures for
          retrieving <literal>Claim</literal>s and
          <literal>ExpenseItem</literal>s. Note that there is no hard rule
          about the scope of a single Repository - we could have decided to
          separate this into a <literal>ClaimRepository</literal> and an
          <literal moreinfo="none">ExpenseItemRepository</literal> if that
          offered us some advantage.</para>

          <para>The example application contains two concrete implementations
          of <literal>ClaimRepository</literal>:</para>

          <programlisting format="linespecific">org.apache.isis.example.expenses.services.inmemory.ClaimRepositoryInMemory
org.apache.isis.example.expenses.services.hibernate.ClaimRepositoryHibernate</programlisting>

          <para>The first of these is intended for use with a standalone
          prototype - with a relatively small number of object instances, all
          held in memory. So the finder methods can be written 'naively' - to
          enumerate through all the objects in a class and find the match(es).
          The following is its implementation of the
          <literal>findClaimsAwaitingApprovalBy</literal> method:</para>

          <programlisting format="linespecific">    public List&lt;Claim&gt; findClaimsAwaitingApprovalBy( final Employee approver ) {
        return allMatches(
            Claim.class, 
            new Filter() {
                public boolean accept(final Object obj) {
                    Claim claim = (Claim) obj;
                    return claim.getStatus().isSubmitted() &amp;&amp; claim.getApprover() == approver;
                }
            });
    }</programlisting>

          <para>This delegates to an <literal>allMatches</literal>
          method, inherited from
          <literal>AbstractFactoryAndRepository</literal>, and use a
          <literal>Filter</literal> object (created in-line) to compare to
          each instance of <literal>Claim</literal> held in memory. Such
          methods are very simple to write and debug (because they can invoke
          methods on the objects being searched, such as
          <literal>isSubmitted</literal> here), but they would not
          operate efficiently for large numbers of objects.</para>

          <para><literal>ClaimRepositoryHibernate</literal> is written to
          work with the Hibernate Object Store and can work efficiently at
          large scale. Here is its the
          <literal>findClaimsAwaitingApprovalBy</literal> method:</para>

          <programlisting format="linespecific">public List&lt;Claim&gt; findClaimsAwaitingApprovalBy( final Employee approver ) {
    final Criteria criteria = hibernateHelper.createCriteria(Claim.class);
    criteria.
        add(Restrictions.eq("approver", approver)).
        createCriteria("status").
        add(Restrictions.eq("titleString", ClaimStatus.SUBMITTED));
    return hibernateHelper.findByCriteria(criteria, Claim.class);
}</programlisting>

          <para>This implementation uses a <literal>Criteria</literal>
          object, a class provided by the <ulink url="www.hibernate.org">Hibernate</ulink> framework.</para>

          <para>Both <literal>ClaimRepositoryInMemory</literal> and
          <literal>ClaimRepositoryHibernate</literal> inherit from
          <literal>ClaimRepositoryAbstract</literal>, which inherits from
          <literal>AbstractFactoryAndRepository</literal> and also
          implements the <literal>ClaimRepository</literal> interface.
          This pattern is not a requirement - the implementations do not need
          to inherit from any framework class, they can just implement the
          required Repository interface natively. However the advantage of
          this pattern is that some simple query methods can be written
          generically, as shown in these two examples:</para>

          <programlisting format="linespecific">public List&lt;ExpenseItem&gt; findExpenseItemsOfType(final Employee employee, final ExpenseType type) {
    final List&lt;Claim&gt; claims = findClaims(employee, null, null);
    final List&lt;ExpenseItem&gt; items = new ArrayList&lt;ExpenseItem&gt;();
    for (final Claim claim : claims) {
        ExpenseItem pattern = (ExpenseItem) newTransientInstance((Class) type.correspondingClass());
        pattern.setClaim(claim);
        List list = (List) uniqueMatch((Class) type.correspondingClass(), pattern, EXCLUDING_SUBCLASSES);
        items.addAll(list);
    }
    return items;
}

public ClaimStatus findClaimStatus(String title) {
    return uniqueMatch(ClaimStatus.class, title, EXCLUDING_SUBCLASSES);
}</programlisting>

          <para>These two query methods both delegate to
          <literal>uniqueMatch</literal>, inherited from
          <literal>AbstractFactoryAndRepository</literal>, but different,
          overloaded, versions of that method.
          <literal>findExpenseItemsOfType</literal> invokes
          <literal>uniqueMatch</literal> with a pattern - an instance of
          <literal>ExpenseItem</literal> that has been set up with the
          fields where a match is required.
          <literal>findClaimStatus</literal> invokes
          <literal>uniqueMatch</literal> with a
          <literal>String</literal> representing the title of the object
          required. The implementation of both of these forms of query is
          delegated to the object store, in a manner that is transparent to
          the application programmer. So, if the nature of the query can be
          represented in the form of a find by title, or a find by pattern,
          then it is advantageous to use these methods on
          <literal>AbstractFactoryAndRepository</literal>. Otherwise you
          can write specialised methods on the respective repository
          implementations.</para>

          <para>As with all services, we need to inform the framework of the
          existence and intent of these implementations, via the properties
          files. Within <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">isis.properties</filename> you will
          find:</para>

          <programlisting format="linespecific">isis.services=services.inmemory.ClaimRepositoryInMemory</programlisting>

          <para>and within <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">persistor_hibernate.properties</filename> you will
          find:</para>

          <programlisting format="linespecific">isis.services = services.hibernate.ClaimRepositoryHibernate</programlisting>

          <para><filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">persistor_hibernate.properties</filename> is only
          referenced if the application is run with the Hibernate Object
          Store, in which case the framework will recognise that
          <literal>ClaimRepositoryHibernate</literal> is intended to
          replace <literal>ClaimRepositoryInMemory</literal> as the
          implementation to use.</para>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>Factories</title>

          <para>A Factory is just the name we give to a kind of service that
          specialises in the creation of new objects, of one or more kinds. It
          is not necessary to use a Factory in order to create objects within
          [[NAME]]: we may invoke the methods
          <literal>newTransientInstance</literal> from within a method
          on a domain object or within any service.</para>

          <para>However, if there is a need to create a type of object from
          several different places in the application, and there are common
          steps involved, then it is good practice to delegate this to a
          Factory. Within [[NAME]] a Factory is just another service, it
          doesn't have any special status. For example, within the Expenses
          application, new <literal>Claim</literal>s and new
          <literal>ExpenseItem</literal>s are created via the
          <literal>ClaimFactory</literal>. However, new
          <literal>RecordedAction</literal>s are created in the
          <literal>RecordedActionService</literal>. Note that
          <literal>ClaimFactory</literal> is specified as a class rather
          than an interface, because we have no particular reason to
          anticipate different implementations of the factory.</para>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Using services</title>

        <para>Services are used within [[NAME]] in three ways:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Injected into domain objects</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Directly accessible to the user</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>To contribute actions to domain objects</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>We'll look at these three in turn.</para>

        <section>
          <title>Injecting Services into domain objects</title>

          <para>Objects may need access to services, such as repositories for
          finding related objects, or for calling functionality from outside
          the domain model. [[NAME]] uses the 'dependency injection'
          model. Each object merely needs to provide a <literal moreinfo="none">set</literal> method for each type of service that
          it requires. For example, within the Employee object there is a code
          region labelled <literal moreinfo="none">Injected
          Services</literal>:</para>

          <programlisting format="linespecific">// {{ Injected Services
    // {{ Injected: RecordActionService
    private RecordActionService recordActionService;

    protected RecordActionService getRecordActionService() {
        return this.recordActionService;
    }

    public void setRecordActionService(final RecordActionService recordActionService) {
        this.recordActionService = recordActionService;
    }
    // }}

    // {{ Injected: UserFinder
    private UserFinder userFinder;

    protected UserFinder getUserFinder() {
        return this.userFinder;
    }

    public void setUserFinder(final UserFinder userFinder) {
        this.userFinder = userFinder;
    }
    // }}
// }}</programlisting>

          <para>In this case, the Employee object has specified that it
          requires two services to be injected: a <literal moreinfo="none">RecordActionService</literal> and a <literal moreinfo="none">UserFinder</literal>. Whenever an instance of
          Employee is created, or retrieved from the object store, [[NAME]]
          Objects will inject the implementation that it knows about (as
          specified in properties) for each type of service required. Note
          that, unlike the other properties we have looked at, <literal moreinfo="none">get</literal> methods may be <literal moreinfo="none">protected</literal>, because the property is not
          displayed. (Strictly speaking a <literal moreinfo="none">get</literal> is often not needed here - as the
          injected service may be accessed via the variable - but it is
          considered to be good practice.)</para>

          <para>From within the object we can then call any of the methods
          defined for those types of service. For example, we can see that the
          <literal>hideEmailAddress</literal> method makes a call (via
          <literal>employeeIsCurrentUser</literal>) to the
          <literal>UserFinder</literal> service:</para>

          <programlisting format="linespecific">public boolean hideEmailAddress() {
    return !employeeIsCurrentUser();
}

private boolean employeeIsCurrentUser() {
    return getUserFinder().currentUserAsObject() == this;
}</programlisting>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>Making services directly accessible to the user</title>

          <para>Services may be made available directly to the user. On the
          DND user interface these appear as the large icons on the desktop;
          on the HTML user interface (that is, as styled by the default CSS)
          these appear as the tabs across the top of the screen. Which
          services are made available to a particular user are defined in
          'perspectives' within a user profile. Within the Fixture project the
          class <literal>ExplorationUserProfileFixture</literal> defines
          the perspectives for various defined prototype users:</para>

          <programlisting format="linespecific">public class ExplorationUserProfileFixture extends UserProfileFixture {

    @Override
    protected void installProfiles() {
        ...
        Profile svenProfile = newUserProfile();
        Perspective claimsPerspective = svenProfile.newPerspective("Claims");
        claimsPerspective.addToServices(Claims.class);
        claimsPerspective.addToServices(Employees.class);
        saveForUser("sven", svenProfile);
        ...

    }
}</programlisting>

          <para>The above example specifies that the user 'sven' is to be
          given a perspective called 'Claims', which gives him direct access
          to two services: <literal>ClaimStartPoints</literal> and
          <literal>EmployeeStartPoints</literal>. If we look at the second
          of those, we can see that it defines two actions:
          <literal>findEmployeeByName</literal> and
          <literal>me</literal>:</para>

          <programlisting format="linespecific">  @Named("Employees")
  public class EmployeeStartPoints extends AbstractService {
      // {{ Title &amp; ID

      // {{ Injected Services

      @MemberOrder(sequence = "2")
      public List&lt;Employee&gt; findEmployeeByName(@Named("Name (or start of Name)")
      final String name) {
          List&lt;Employee&gt; results = employeeRepository.findEmployeeByName(name);
          if (results.isEmpty()) {
              warnUser("No employees found matching name: " + name);
              return null;
          }
          return results;
      }

      @Executed(Executed.Where.LOCALLY)
      public Employee me() {
          Employee me = employeeRepository.me();
          if (me == null) {
              warnUser("No Employee representing current user");
          }
          return me;
      }
  }</programlisting>

          <para>Both of these methods delegate to methods on the
          <literal>EmployeeRepository</literal>, which has been injected
          (services may be injected into other services, just as into domain
          objects). Note that it is not necessary to define specific services
          to be provided directly to the user - we could provide the user with
          direct access to the Repositories, Factories or other services
          specified within the application. Creating dedicated user-oriented
          service definitions just helps us to separate the concerns. Calling
          them 'Start Points' is also just a convention.</para>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>Using services to contribute actions to domain
          objects</title>

          <para>The screens below show the action menu on the Claim object, as
          rendered by the two different user interfaces:</para>

          
            <mediaobject>
              <imageobject>
                <imagedata align="center" contentwidth="40%" fileref="images/claim-contributed-actions.png" format="PNG"/>
              </imageobject>
            </mediaobject>
          

          <para>This menu has a sub-menu, entitled 'Recorded Actions',
          containing, in this case, a single method 'All Recorded Actions'.
          Sub-menus in [[NAME]] are 'contributed' by services; the
          actions in the sub-menus are described as 'contributed actions'. In
          this case the actions are contributed the service
          <literal>RecordedActionContributedActions</literal>:</para>

          <programlisting format="linespecific">  @Named("Recorded Actions")
  public class RecordedActionContributedActions extends AbstractService {

      // {{ Injected Services
 
      public List&lt;RecordedAction&gt; allRecordedActions(RecordedActionContext context) {
          return recordedActionRepository.allRecordedActions(context);
      }
  }</programlisting>

          <para>The method <literal>allRecordedActions</literal> takes a
          <literal>RecordedActionContext</literal> as a parameter, and
          will return all the <literal>RecordedAction</literal>s
          associated with that object. Note that
          <literal>RecordedActionContext</literal> is an interface that
          defines no methods - it is purely a type definition:</para>

          <programlisting format="linespecific">public interface RecordedActionContext {
}</programlisting>

          <para>However, this interface is implemented by two classes:
          <literal>Employee</literal> and <literal>Claim</literal>.
          The net result of this is that the action 'All Recorded Actions'
          will be contributed to each instance of
          <literal>Employee</literal> and of <literal>Claim</literal>.
          By default, this would appear in a sub-menu named after the service
          on which the method was defined (i.e. 'Recorded Action Contributed
          Actions'), but in this case we have used the <literal moreinfo="none">@Named</literal> annotation to override this and
          render the service name, and hence the sub-menu name, simply as
          'Recorded Actions'.</para>

          <para>We can also see that this method delegates its execution to
          the <literal>RecordedActionRepository</literal>, which has been
          injected as a service. You are not required to follow this pattern,
          or this naming convention. In fact, if the
          <literal>allRecordedActions</literal> method on
          <literal>RecordedActionRepository</literal> was not
          <literal>@Hidden</literal>, then it would have been contributed
          automatically - without the need for defining
          <literal>RecordedActionContributedActions</literal>. We have
          defined the latter purely to help convey intent and manage our code
          base.</para>

          <para>The rule is that any method defined on any service that the
          user is authorised to access (see <xref linkend="authorization"/>)
          and is not hidden, will be contributed to any object of a type that
          features as any of the parameters to that method.</para>

          <para>This is a very powerful feature of [[NAME]], but it is
          one that takes a bit of getting used to. In some respects it is a
          little bit like Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP), in that it allows
          an object effectively to inherit capabilities from several different
          sources. However, this all takes place at run-time, not at compile
          time.</para>

          <para>In a more complex application, it might well be that a domain
          object might have several contributed sub-menus, each containing
          several methods. Designing an application this way allows us to keep
          the model well partitioned. In this very simple example, it has
          allowed us to keep the part of the model concerned with recording
          actions very separate from the other parts of the model.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Fixtures</title>

        <para>Fixtures are used to set up objects within the code based,
        principally for use within prototyping and or testing. [[NAME]]
        provides specific support for using fixtures. The following code shows
        a fixture class that sets up one claim:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">public class SvenClaim1NewStatus extends AbstractClaimFixture {
    
    public static Employee SVEN;
    public static Employee DICK;
    public static Claim SVEN_CLAIM_1;

    @Override
    public void install() {
        SVEN = EmployeeFixture.SVEN;
        DICK = EmployeeFixture.DICK;

        SVEN_CLAIM_1 =createNewClaim(SVEN, DICK, "28th Mar - Sales call, London", ProjectCodeFixture.CODE1, new Date(2007,4,3));
        Date mar28th = new Date(2007,3,28);
        addTaxi(SVEN_CLAIM_1, mar28th, null, 8.50, "Euston", "Mayfair", false);
        addMeal(SVEN_CLAIM_1, mar28th, "Lunch with client", 31.90);
        addTaxi(SVEN_CLAIM_1, mar28th, null, 11.00, "Mayfair", "City", false);
    } 
}</programlisting>

        <para>This inherits from <literal>AbstractClaimFixture</literal>,
        which provides the helper methods such as
        <literal>createNewClaim</literal>, and which inherits in turn
        from <literal>AbstractFixture</literal>, a class in the [[NAME]]
        Objects application library. However, there is no need to follow this
        pattern: a fixture may be any class that has an
        <literal>install</literal> method.</para>

        <para>Fixtures may be composite, as we can see in this example:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">public class SvenClaims_All extends AbstractClaimFixture {
    
    public SvenClaims_All() {
        addFixture(new SvenClaim1NewStatus());
        addFixture(new SvenClaim2Submitted());
        addFixture(new SvenClaim5New());
        addFixture(new SvenClaim3Returned());
        addFixture(new SvenClaim4Approved());
    }  
    
    public void install() {}
}</programlisting>

        <para>This fixture has had five other fixtures added to it. The
        <literal>install</literal> method is empty: [[NAME]] will
        automatically call <literal>install</literal> on each of the
        fixtures that has been added to this composite fixture. This pattern
        makes it easy to manage large fixtures, and multiple sets of
        (potentially overlapping) fixtures, both for prototyping and for
        testing.</para>

        <para>As with services, [[NAME]] needs to be instructed which
        fixtures it should use when running an application. This may be done
        in the properties files, for example:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">isis.fixtures.prefix=org.apache.isis.example.expenses.fixtures
isis.fixtures=ExplorationPerspectiveFixture, RefdataFixture, EmployeeFixture,  SvenClaims_All</programlisting>

        <para>Note that this also specifies the
        <literal>ExplorationPerspectiveFixture</literal>, which we looked
        at earlier.</para>

        <para>Fixtures may also be specified as a command line parameter (see
        <xref linkend="command-line-parameters"/>) when launching the
        application from the command line; composite fixtures are especially
        handy in this circumstance.</para>

        <para>Like all Java frameworks [[NAME]] is essentially a set of
        classes and other resources that you run your code with. There are a
        number of ways of developing with [[NAME]]: downloading a

        Maven to create and manage your [[NAME]] projects. Which you
        choose is a matter of preference and familiarity.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Prerequisites</title>

        <para>To develop or run [[NAME]] applications you need Java
        version 1.5 or above installed on your machine.</para>

        <para>To build and run the examples you will also need either <ulink url="http://ant.apache.org/">Ant</ulink> or <ulink url="http://maven.apache.org">Maven</ulink> installed, both available
        from Apache.</para>

        <para>To develop applications you will need a suitable development
        environment. If you have the choice, we recommend using <ulink url="www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</ulink>, because there are some specific
        plug-ins available for Eclipse to facilitate developing with [[NAME]]
        Objects. However, [[NAME]] may be used with any IDE, or even just
        the JDK.</para>

        the Ant release (suffixed with '-for-ant' ), the Maven release
        (suffixed with '-for-maven'), the full source release (suffixed with
        '-source' ) if you wish to build the framework yourself, or simply a

            Objects, the libs and examples. This source can be used, with the

            <para>To install all the components into your local repository,

      <title>Developing domain objects - a how-to guide</title>

      <para>This section defines a set of conventions for writing domain
      objects, that are together known as the '[[NAME]] (Java)
      Programming Model'.</para>

      <para>Following these conventions does not tie your domain objects to
      the [[NAME]] Framework or any other framework: the resulting domain
      objects may be run within any framework or platform that supports POJOs
      (Plain Old Java Objects). A few of the conventions do make use of
      Interfaces or Annotations that are necessarily defined somewhere - in
      this case they are in the [[NAME]] AppLib. However, the AppLib is
      not itself dependent upon the [[NAME]] Framework (and in theory
      another framework implementation could support the same applib).</para>

      <para>The conventions of the programming model are best described as
      'intentional' - they convey an intention as to how domain objects, their
      properties and behaviours, are to be made available to users. The
      specific way in which those intentions are interpreted or implemented
      will depend upon the framework, and/or the particular components or
      options selected within that framework.</para>

      <para>To pick a single example, marking up a domain class with the
      annotation <code>@Bounded</code> is an indication that the class is
      intended to have only a small number of instances and that the set does
      not change very often - such as the class <code>Country</code>. This is
      an indication to any interested framework that the whole set of
      instances might be offered to the user in a convenient form such as a
      drop-down list. The programming convention has <emphasis>not</emphasis>
      been defined as <code>@DropDownList</code> because the user interface
      might not support drop-down-lists - but it might provide a capability to
      select from an <code>@Bounded</code> class by typing the initial letters
      of the desired instance.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Object-level specifications</title>

        <para>The first set of conventions are concerned with the capabilities
        or behaviour of an object as a whole.</para>

        <section>
          <title condition="java">How to specify a title for an object</title>

          <para>A title is used to identify an object to the user in the user
          interface. For example, a Customer's title might be the
          organization's customer reference, or perhaps (more informally)
          their first and last names. By default, the framework will use the
          object's <literal moreinfo="none">toString()</literal> method as the
          title. However, if a <literal moreinfo="none">title()
          </literal>method (returning a <literal moreinfo="none">String</literal>) is present, then that is used
          instead, thus:</para>

          <para><programlisting format="linespecific">public String toString()</programlisting></para>

          <para>or</para>

          <para><programlisting format="linespecific">public String title()</programlisting></para>

          <para>The reason for providing the option to use a <literal moreinfo="none">title</literal> method is in case the programmer
          needs to make use of the <literal moreinfo="none">toString</literal>
          method for other purposes, such as for debugging.</para>

          <title condition=".net">How to specify the icon for an
          object</title>

          <para condition="1.5">By default, the framework will look for an
          image in the <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">images</filename> directory (which must be on the

          object of type Customer, it will look for <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">Customer.gif</filename> or
          <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">Customer.png</filename>.
          If it finds no such file, then it will work up the inheritance
          hierarchy to see if there is an icon matching the name of any of the
          super-classes, and use that instead. If no matching icon is found
          then the framework will look for an image called <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">default</filename> in the images
          directory, and if this has not been specified, then the framework
          will use its own default image for an icon.</para>

          <para>We strongly recommend that you adopt 'camel case' as the
          convention for icon file names: if you have a class called
          <literal> OrderLine</literal>, then call the icon
          <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">OrderLine.gif</filename>
          or <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">OrderLine.png</filename> (JPEG suffixes
          <filename moreinfo="none">OrderLine.jpg</filename> or
          <filename moreinfo="none">OrderLine.jpeg</filename> will also be recognized but
          generally GIF or PNG are to be preferred). Actually, the framework
          will also recognise <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">orderline.gif</filename>, but some operating systems
          and deployment environments are case sensitive, so it is good
          practice to adopt an unambiguous convention.</para>

          <para>The programmer may choose to specify, manually, which icon to
          use, by specifying an <literal moreinfo="none">iconName</literal>
          method:</para>

          <programlisting format="linespecific">    public String iconName() {
        return "Person";
    }</programlisting>

          <para>This makes it easy for more than one class to use the same
          icon, without having to duplicate the image file.</para>

          <para>The <code>iconName</code> method may also be used to specify
          an individual icon for each instance. For example, an instance of
          <literal>Product</literal> could use a photograph of the product
          as an icon, using:</para>

          <programlisting format="linespecific">    public String iconName() {
        return getProductName() + "-photograph";
    }</programlisting>

          <para>or to vary the icon according to the status of the
          object:<programlisting format="linespecific">    public String iconName() {
        return "Order-" + getStatus();
    }</programlisting></para>

        <section>
          <title>How to create or delete objects within your code</title>

          <para>When you create any domain object within your application
          code, it is important that the framework is made aware of the
          existence of this new object - in order that it may be persisted to
          the object store, and in order that any services that the new object
          needs are injected into it. Just specifying <literal moreinfo="none">new Customer()</literal>, for example, will create a
          Customer object, but that object will <emphasis>not</emphasis> be
          known to the framework. However, since we do not want to tie our
          domain objects to a particular framework, we use the idea of a
          'container' to intermediate. The application library provides an
          interface:</para>

          <para><literal moreinfo="none">org.apache.isis.applib.DomainObjectContainer</literal>
          which in turn defines the following methods for managing domain
          objects:</para>

          <para><literal moreinfo="none">&lt;T&gt; T
          newTransientInstance(final Class&lt;T&gt; ofClass)</literal> returns
          a new instance of the specified class, that is transient (unsaved).
          This may subsequently saved either by the user invoking the Save
          action (that will automatically be rendered on the object view) or
          programmatically by calling <literal moreinfo="none">void
          makePersistent(Object transientObject)</literal></para>

          <para><literal moreinfo="none">&lt;T&gt; T
          newPersistentInstance(final Class&lt;T&gt; ofClass)</literal>
          creates a new object already persisted.</para>

          <para><literal moreinfo="none">boolean
          isPersistent()</literal>checks whether an object has already been
          persisted. (Useful in controlling visibility or availability of
          properties or actions).</para>

          <para><literal moreinfo="none">void remove(Object object)</literal>
          deletes a persistent object from the object store.</para>

          <para>Any framework that recognises the [[NAME]] Programming
          Model will provide an implementation of
          <code>DomainObjectContainer</code> and will take responsibility to
          inject a reference to that Container into any domain object that
          needs it.</para>

          <para>A domain object specifies that it needs to have a reference to
          the Container injected into by including the following code:</para>

          <programlisting format="linespecific">    private DomainObjectContainer container;

    protected DomainObjectContainer getContainer() {
        return this.container;
    }
    public final void setContainer(final DomainObjectContainer container) {
        this.container = container;
    }</programlisting>

          <para>Creating or deleting objects is then done by invoking those
          methods on the Container. For example the following code would then
          create a new Customer object within another method:</para>

          <programlisting format="linespecific">    Customer newCust = (Customer) getContainer().newTransientInstance(Customer.class);
    newCust.setName("Charlie");
    getContainer().persist(newCust);</programlisting>

          <para>If you are able to make your domain object inherit from
          <literal moreinfo="none">org.apache.isis.applib.AbstractDomainObject</literal>
          then you have direct access to those methods, so the code would
          become:</para>

          <programlisting format="linespecific">    Customer newCust = (Customer) newTransientInstance(Customer.class);
    newCust.setName("Charlie");
    persist(newCust);</programlisting>

          <para>These methods are actually provided by the
          <literal>org.apache.isis.applib.AbstractContainedObject</literal>
          and so are also available on <literal moreinfo="none">org.apache.isis.applib.AbstractService</literal>
          (and, hence, on <literal moreinfo="none">org.apache.isis.applib.AbstractFactoryAndRepository</literal>)
          for creating objects within a service.</para>

          <warning>
            <para>It is possible to create a transient object within another
            transient object. When the framework persists any transient
            object, it will automatically persist any other transient object
            referenced by that object. However, if any of these transient
            objects are to be exposed to the user (while in their transient
            state), then you need to write your code very carefully -
            anticipating the fact that the user could elect to save any of the
            transient objects at any point - which could cause the graph of
            related objects to be persisted in an invalid state.</para>

            <para>The recommended approach is, if possible, to mark these
            supplementary classes as not persistable by the user (see <xref linkend="not-persistable"/>), or not to permit the user to create
            a new transient object that is a child of an existing transient
            object, but, rather, to require the user to save the parent object
            first.</para>

          <para>The following is a list of methods that correspond to various
          events in the life-cycle of a domain object. If a domain object
          implements any of these methods (they are all optional) then the
          framework will call that method whenever the corresponding event
          occurs. For example, <literal moreinfo="none"><literal>persisted</literal></literal> is
          called after an object has been persisted. One reason for
          implementing the <literal moreinfo="none"><literal>persisted</literal></literal> method
          might be to set up a reverse association that we do not want to be
          set up until the new object has been persisted.</para>

          <para><literal moreinfo="none">public void created() </literal>will
          be called by the framework at logical creation of the object</para>

          <para><literal moreinfo="none">public void loading()</literal> will

          loaded into memory</para>

          <para><literal moreinfo="none">public void persisting()
          </literal>will be called by the framework just before a transient

          <para><literal moreinfo="none">public void persisted() </literal>

        <title>Properties</title>

        <para>The following conventions are concerned with specifying the

        those properties.</para>

        <section>
          <title>How to add a property to an object</title>

          <para>Properties are specified using the JavaBean conventions,
          recognizing a standard accessor/mutator pair (<code>get</code> and
          <code>set</code>). The syntax is:</para>

          <para><programlisting format="linespecific">public &lt;property type&gt; get&lt;PropertyName&gt;() 

public void set&lt;PropertyName&gt;(&lt;property type&gt; param)</programlisting></para>

          <para>where <literal moreinfo="none">&lt;property type&gt;</literal>
          is a primitive, a value object or an entity object.</para>

          <para>Properties may reference either a value or another domain
          object. Values include Java primitives, and JDK classes with value
          semantics (<literal moreinfo="none">java.lang.Strings</literal> and
          <literal moreinfo="none">java.util.Dates</literal>). A property
          referencing another domain object is sometimes called an
          association.</para>

          <para>For example, the following example contains both a value
          (<literal moreinfo="none">String</literal>) property and a reference
          (<literal moreinfo="none">Organisation</literal>) property:</para>

          <programlisting format="linespecific">public class Customer {
    private String firstName;
    public String getFirstName() {
        return firstName;
    }
    public void setFirstName(String firstName) {
        this.firstName = firstName;
    }

    private Organisation organisation;
    public Organisation getOrganisation() {
        return organisation;
    }

          <section>
            <title>Disabling a property under certain conditions</title>

            <para>A <literal moreinfo="none">disable</literal> method can be
            used to disable a particular instance's member under certain
            conditions. The syntax is:</para>

            <para><literal moreinfo="none">public String
            disable&lt;PropertyName&gt;()</literal> A non-null return value
            indicates the reason why the property cannot be modified. The
            framework is responsible for providing this feedback to the user.
            For example:</para>

            <programlisting format="linespecific">public class OrderLine {
    public String getQuantity() { ... }
    public void setQuantity(int quantity) { ... }

    public String disableFirstName() { 
        if (this.hasBeenSubmitted()) {
            return "Cannot alter any quantity after Order has been submitted"; 
        }
        return null;
    }
}</programlisting>
          </section>

          <section>
            <title>Disabling a property for specific users or roles</title>

            <para>Generally it is not good practice to embed knowledge of
            roles and/or users into the domain classes. This is the
            responsibility of the framework or platform and should be
            specified and administered externally to the domain model.</para>

            <para>However, in rare circumstances it might be necessary or
            pragmatic to implement access control within the domain model
            using the inherited <literal>getUser()</literal>
            method:</para>

            <para>For example:</para>

            <programlisting format="linespecific">import org.apache.isis.applib.UserMemento;

public class Employee {
    public BigDecimal getSalary() { ... }
    public void setSalary(BigDecimal salary) { ... }

          <title>How to validate user input to a property</title>

          <para>A <literal moreinfo="none">validate</literal> method is used
          to check that a new value for a property is valid. If the proffered
          value is deemed to be invalid then the property will not be changed.
          A non-null return <code>String</code> indicates the reason why the
          member cannot be modified/action be invoked; the framework is
          responsible for providing this feedback to the user.</para>

          <para>The syntax is:</para>

          <para><programlisting format="linespecific">public String validate&lt;PropertyName&gt;(&lt;property type&gt; param)</programlisting></para>

          <title>How to specify a set of choices and or a default value for a
          property</title>

          <para>The simplest way to provide the user with a set of choices for
          a property (possibly rendered as a drop-down list, for example) is
          to ensure that the type used by the property is marked up as
          <code>@Bounded</code>. However, this is not always appropriate. For
          example you might wish to provide the user with the choice of all
          the Addresses known for that Customer, with the most recently-used
          address as the default.</para>

          <para>The syntax for specifying a default value is:</para>

          <para><programlisting format="linespecific">public &lt;property type&gt; default&lt;PropertyName&gt;()</programlisting></para>

          <para>And for specifying a list of choices is:</para>

          <para><programlisting format="linespecific">public &lt;array or collection of property type&gt; choices&lt;PropertyName&gt;()</programlisting></para>

          <para>The full code for our example above is:</para>

          <programlisting format="linespecific">public class Order {
    public Address getShippingAddress() { ... }

          <title>How to trigger other behaviour when a property is
          changed</title>

          <para>If you want to invoke functionality whenever a property is
          changed by the user, then you should create a <literal moreinfo="none">modify</literal> <literal moreinfo="none">&lt;propertyName&gt;</literal> and include the
          functionality within that. For example:</para>

          <programlisting format="linespecific">public int getAmount() {}
public void setAmount(int amount) {}

public void modifyAmount(int amount) {
     setAmount(amount);
     addToTotal(amount);
}</programlisting>

          <para>The reason for the <literal moreinfo="none">modifyAmount</literal> method is that it would not
          be a good idea to include the <literal moreinfo="none">addToTotal</literal> call within the <literal moreinfo="none">setAmount</literal> method , because that method may
          be called by the persistence mechanism when an object is retrieved
          from storage.</para>

          <para>You may optionally also specify a
          <code>clear&lt;PropertyName&gt;</code> which works the same way as
          modify <literal moreinfo="none">modify</literal> <literal moreinfo="none">&lt;propertyName&gt;</literal> but is called when
          the property is cleared by the user (i.e. the current value replaced
          by nothing).</para>

          <para>These methods may also be used for setting up bidirectional
          relationships (using the 'mutual registration pattern'). For
          example:</para>

          <programlisting format="linespecific">public class Employee {
    private Department department;
    public Department getDepartment() {
        return department;
    }
    public void setDepartment(Department department) { 
        this.department = department;
    }
    public void modifyDepartment(Department department) {
        setDepartment(department);
        department.addToStaff(this);
    }
    public void clearDepartment(Department department) {
        setDepartment(null);
        department.removeFromStaff(this);
    }

    ...

        <title>Actions</title>

        <para>An 'action' is a method that we expect the user to be able to
        invoke via the user interface, though it may also be invoked
        programmatically within the object model. The following conventions
        are used to determine when and how methods are made available to the
        user as actions.</para>

        <section>
          <title>How to add an action to an object</title>

          <para>By default, any <literal moreinfo="none">public</literal>
          instance method that you add to a class will be treated as a user
          action, unless it represents a property, collection, or another
          reserved method defined in this manual.</para>

          <para>If you have a method that you don't want to be made available
          as a user-action you should either make it <literal moreinfo="none">protected</literal> or <literal moreinfo="none">private</literal> or use the <literal moreinfo="none">@Hidden</literal> annotation. Note also that
          <literal moreinfo="none">static</literal> methods are ignored: such
          functionality should reside in a service, such as a Repository or
          Factory.</para>

          <para>We refer to all methods that are intended to be invoked by
          users as 'action methods'.</para>

          <para>The syntax is:</para>

          <para><programlisting format="linespecific">public void &lt;actionName&gt;([&lt;value or entity type&gt; param]...)</programlisting></para>

          <para>or</para>

          <para><programlisting format="linespecific">public &lt;return type&gt; &lt;actionName&gt;([&lt;value or entity type&gt; param]...)</programlisting></para>

          <para>When a method returns a reference the viewer will attempt to
          display that object. If the return value is <code>null</code> then
          nothing is displayed.</para>

        <section>
          <title>How to specify parameters for an action</title>

          <para>If an action method takes parameters, the viewing mechanism
          will automatically require the user to specify these parameters (for
          example, in the form of a dialog box) - and ensure that they are of
          the correct type.</para>

          <section>
            <title>Specifying parameter names and/or descriptions</title>

            <para>Unlike with properties, the framework cannot pick up the
            names of parameters that you use within the domain code. By
            default parameters will be labelled only with the type of the
            object required (e.g. 'String:' or 'Customer:) If you want a
            parameter to have a different name (such as 'First Name', 'Last
            Name') then that parameter should be marked up with an <literal moreinfo="none">@Named</literal> annotation - very often taking
            the same form as the parameter name used in the code. (This is one
            of the few forms of duplication that we cannot eliminate; the
            parameter name is not available in the class' bytecode and so
            cannot be inferred automatically. Alternatively though, you could
            create a user-defined value type, using
            <literal moreinfo="none">@Value</literal>).</para>

            <para>Similarly, any parameter may be given a short
            user-description using the <literal moreinfo="none">@DescribedAs</literal> annotation. The framework
            takes responsibility to make this available to the user.</para>
          </section>

          <section>
            <title>How to make a parameter optional</title>

            <para>By default, the framework assumes that when an action method
            is to be invoked, all the parameters are mandatory. You may
            over-ride this behaviour by marking up one or more of the
            paramaters with the <literal moreinfo="none">@Optional</literal>
            annotation.</para>
          </section>

          <section>
            <title>How to specify default values for parameters</title>

            <para>When an action is about to be invoked, then default values
            can be provided for any or all of its parameters.</para>

            <para>There are two different ways to specify parameters; either
            per parameter, or for all parameters. The per-parameter form is
            simpler and probably preferred; the syntax is:</para>

            <programlisting format="linespecific">public &lt;parameter type&gt; defaultN&lt;ActionName&gt;()</programlisting>

            <para>where N indicates the 0-based parameter number. For
            example:</para>

            <programlisting format="linespecific">public class Customer {
    public Order placeOrder(
                      Product product,
                      @Named("Quantity") 
                      int quantity) {
        ...
    }
    public Product default0PlaceOrder() {
        return productMostRecentlyOrderedBy(this.getCustomer());
    }
}</programlisting>

            <para>The syntax for specifying all the parameter default values
            in one go is:</para>

            <para><programlisting format="linespecific">public Object[] default&lt;ActionName&gt;([&lt;parameter type&gt; param]...)</programlisting></para>

            <para>returning an array (which must have one element per
            parameter in the action method signature) of corresponding default
            values. For example:</para>

            <programlisting format="linespecific">public class Customer {
    public Order placeOrder(
                      Product product,
                      @Named("Quantity") 
                      int quantity) {y
        ...
    }
    public Object[] defaultPlaceOrder(
                      Product product,
                      int quantity) {

            <para>The programmer may provide a set of choices for the value of
            any or all of the parameters of an action. These will be made
            available to the user - for example as a drop-down list.</para>

            <para>As for defaults, there are two different ways to specify
            parameters; either per parameter, or for all parameters. The
            per-parameter form is simpler and probably preferred; the syntax
            is:</para>

            <programlisting format="linespecific">public List&lt;parameter type&gt; choicesN&lt;ActionName&gt;()</programlisting>

            <para>where N indicates the 0-based parameter number. For

    public List&lt;Product&gt; choices0PlaceOrder() {
        return lastFiveProductsOrderedBy(this.getCustomer());
    }
}</programlisting>

            <para>The alternative mechanism is to supply all the parameter
            choices in one go:</para>

            <para><programlisting format="linespecific">public Object[] choices&lt;ActionName&gt;([&lt;parameter type&gt; param]...)</programlisting></para>

            <para>returning an array, which must have one element per
            parameter in the method signature. Each element of the array
            should itself either be an array or a list, containing the set of
            values representing the choices for that parameter, or <literal moreinfo="none">null</literal> if there are no choices to be
            specified for that parameter.</para>

            <para>For example:</para>

            <programlisting format="linespecific">public class Order {

            <para>There may be circumstances in which we do not want the user

            <para>A non-null return <code>String</code> indicates the reason

            <para>It is also possible to permanently disable an action using

        <section>
          <title>How to pass a message back to the user</title>

          <para>Sometimes, within an action it is necessary or desirable to
          pass a message to the user, for example to inform them of the
          results of their action ('5 payments have been issued') or that the
          action was not successful ('No Customer found with name John
          Smith'). <code>DomainObjectContainer</code> defines two methods for
          this purpose:</para>

          <para><programlisting format="linespecific">void informUser(String message)

void warnUser(String message)</programlisting></para>

          <para>These two methods provide different ways to send a message to
          the user, representing increasing levels of severity. How each of
          these messages is rendered visible to the user is determined by the
          framework.</para>

          <para>These two methods are also available on
          <literal>AbstractDomainObject </literal>as a shortcut.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Collections</title>

        <para>A collection is a list of references to several entity objects
        that have a common type.</para>

        <section>
          <title>How to add a collection to an object</title>

          <para>A collection is recognized via an accessor/mutator method pair
          (<code>get</code> and set) for any type of collection provided by
          the programming language. The syntax is:</para>

          <para><programlisting format="linespecific">public &lt;collection type&gt; get&lt;CollectionName&gt;()

private void set&lt;CollectionName&gt;(&lt;collection type&gt; param)</programlisting></para>

          <para>It is recommended that the collections be specified using
          generics (for example: <literal moreinfo="none">List&lt;Customer&gt;</literal> ). That way the
          framework will be able to display the collection based on that type
          definition. (Generics are also required by some persistence
          mechanisms). For example the viewer might display the collection as
          a table, with the columns defined by the visible properties of that
          type. The viewer will then automatically prevent the user from
          adding objects not of that type. If generics are not used then the
          type may be inferred from the <literal moreinfo="none">addTo</literal> / <literal moreinfo="none">removeFrom</literal> methods, if specified (see
          below).</para>

          <para>For example:</para>

          <programlisting format="linespecific">public class Employee { ... }

public class Department {
    private List&lt;Employee&gt; employees = new ArrayList&lt;Employee&gt;();
    public List &lt;Employee&gt; getEmployees() {
        return employees;
    }
    private void setEmployees(List&lt;Employee&gt; employees) { 
        this.employees = employees;
    }
    ...
}</programlisting>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>How to trigger other behaviour when an object is added or
          removed</title>

          <para>A collection may have a corresponding <literal moreinfo="none">addTo</literal> and/or <literal moreinfo="none">removeFrom</literal> method. This is equivalent to
          the <literal moreinfo="none">modify</literal> and <literal moreinfo="none">clear</literal> methods for properties. The syntax
          is:</para>

          <para><programlisting format="linespecific">public void addTo&lt;CollectionName&gt;(&lt;entity type&gt; param)

public void removeFrom&lt;CollectionName&gt;(&lt;entity type&gt; param)</programlisting></para>

          <para>where <literal moreinfo="none">&lt;entity type&gt;</literal>
          is the same type as the generic collection type. For example:</para>

          <programlisting format="linespecific">public class Employee { ... }

public class Department {
    private List&lt;Employee&gt; employees = new ArrayList&lt;Employee&gt;();
    public List &lt;Employee&gt; getEmployees() {
        return employees;
    }
    private void setEmployees(List&lt;Employee&gt; employees) { 
        this.employees = employees;
    }
    public void addToEmployees(Employee employee) {
        employees.add(employee);
    }
    public void removeFromEmployees(Employee employee) {
        employees.remove(employee);
    }

    ...
}</programlisting>

          <para>The addTo / removeFrom and modify / clear methods are
          particularly useful in setting up bidirectional relationships using
          the 'mutual registration pattern'; for a write-up of this pattern,

            <para><literal moreinfo="none">public String
            disable&lt;CollectionName&gt;()</literal> For example:</para>

            <programlisting format="linespecific">public class Department {

          valid. A non-null return <code>String</code> indicates the reason
          why the object cannot be added/removed, and the viewing mechanism
          will display this to the user. The syntax is:</para>

          <para><programlisting format="linespecific">public String validateAddTo&lt;CollectionName&gt;(&lt;property type&gt; param)

        <title>Repositories and Factories</title>

        <para>The [[NAME]] application library provides a class</para>

        <para><literal moreinfo="none">org.apache.isis.applib.AbstractFactoryAndRepository</literal></para>

        <para>that makes it easy to write a Repository and/or Factory to work
        entirely in memory. This is very useful during prototyping, as you can
        quickly get your system up and running without having to deal with a
        database. Refer to the JavaDoc documentation for that class for a full
        list of methods available. However, the following describes some of

        <para><literal moreinfo="none">&lt;T&gt; T newTransientInstance(final
        Class&lt;T&gt; ofClass)</literal> returns a new instance of the
        specified class, that is transient (unsaved). This may subsequently be
        saved either by the user invoking the Save action (that will
        automatically be rendered on the object view) or programmatically by
        calling . . .</para>

        <para><literal moreinfo="none">void makePersistent(Object
        transientObject)</literal></para>

        <para><literal moreinfo="none">&lt;T&gt; T newPersistentInstance(final
        Class&lt;T&gt; ofClass)</literal> creates a new object already
        persisted.</para>

        <para><literal moreinfo="none">void disposeInstance(Object
        persistentObject)</literal></para>

        <para><literal moreinfo="none">&lt;T&gt; List&lt;T&gt;
        allInstances(final Class&lt;T&gt; cls, final boolean
        includeSubclasses)</literal> these may be iterated through for a

      <section>
        <title>Value Types</title>

        <para>In addition to the built-in value types it is also possible to
        define user-defined value types. This is typically done using the
        <literal>@Value</literal> annotation.</para>

        <para>The <literal moreinfo="none">@Value</literal> annotation is used to provide an
        implementation of the <literal>ValueSemanticsProvider</literal>
        interface. In turn this provides objects that allow the framework to
        interact with the value, in particular for parsing (parsing strings
        into values and display values as strings), and for encoding/decoding
        (for serialization for client/server and used by some
        persistors).</para>

        <para>For more details, explore the built-in types within the applib,
        for example
        <literal>org.apache.isis.applib.value.Money</literal>.</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">@Value(semanticsProviderName = "org.apache.isis.metamodel.value.MoneyValueSemanticsProvider")
public class Money extends Magnitude {
    ...
}</programlisting>

        <para>where <literal>MoneyValueSemanticsProvider</literal> is the
        implementation of <literal>ValueSemanticsProvider</literal>
        described above.</para>

        <para>Using value types generally removes the need for using
        <literal moreinfo="none">@MustSatisfy</literal> annotation; the rules can instead move
        down into a <literal>validate</literal> method on the value type
        itself.</para>

        <para><remark>TODO: need to beef up this discussion. Also, note that
        it is possible to register value types using isis.properties
        rather than the @Value annotation; this is particularly useful for
        third-party value types.</remark></para>

      <section>
        <title>Resolve and ObjectChanged</title>

        <para>In previous versions of the framework it was necessary to call

        property or collection's getter, and
        <literal>objectChanged()</literal> within every property's
        setter and every collection's addTo or removeFrom.</para>

        <para>These methods still exist in
        <literal>AbstractDomainObject</literal>, but no longer need to be
        called explicitly. Instead [[NAME]] 4.0 uses bytecode enhancement
        (using either cglib or javassist) to automatically call these methods.
        This bytecode enhancement can be disabled in
        <filename moreinfo="none">isis.properties</filename> file; if it is then the
        methods must be called manually as they were in [[NAME]]

      <title>Building a [[NAME]] application with Ant</title>

      <para>Once an application is written it must, like all Java programs, be

      within the framework there are dependencies that need to be satisfied to
      allow this. [[NAME]] promote two ways of doing this, using Ant and
      Maven. This section looks at how to use Ant to build a [[NAME]]

        <title>Compilation</title>

        <para>To build a [[NAME]] application you need to have access to

        <title>Creating new applications using Maven archetypes</title>

        <para>Using Maven archetype plugin we can generate a new [[NAME]]
        application very quickly. These are multi-moduled projects with
        separate sections for the domain code, fixtures, web interfaces and so
        on.</para>

        <para>One option is to create the archetype from the commandline. Note
        that if you are using Eclipse and have installed the m2eclipse plugin
        then it provides a dialog to create the project from an archetype;
        this is discussed below.</para>

        <remark>TODO: update the listing below, it is out of date. The
        archetype to use is called
        'org.apache.isis:application-archetype'.</remark>

        <para>Be wary of using invalid names. The <emphasis>groupId</emphasis>
        should be alphanumeric with dots to separate the words. The

        <title>Using Eclipse for development</title>

        <para>There are two approaches for using Eclipse in
        development.</para>

        <para>The recommended approach is to use the Eclipse's Maven plug-in,
        m2eclipse, obtainable from <ulink url="???">http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/</ulink>. This then allows the
        Maven projects to be imported directly using File &gt; Import &gt;
        Maven Projects.</para>

        <para/>

        <remark>TODO: would be good to have some screenshots of using
        m2eclipse to import projects here.</remark>

        <para/>

        <para>In fact, you can use m2eclipse to create the project from the
        archetype in a single go:</para>

        <para/>

        <para><remark>TODO: would be good to have a screenshot of using
        m2eclipse to generate project using archetype here.</remark></para>

        <para/>

        <para>Alternatively you can use Maven's Eclipse plug-in to generate
        .project and .classpath files. These can then be imported into Eclipse
        using File &gt; Import &gt; Existing Projects. The remainder of this
        section discusses this alternative approach; to reiterate the
        m2eclipse approach is more straightforward and generally
        preferred.</para>

      <title>Running a [[NAME]] application as a prototype</title>

      <para>A [[NAME]] application is commonly developed in two stages.
      First it is developed as standalone prototype, running on a single
      machine, with no security, and with all the objects in memory. Then it
      is converted into a deployable application i.e. running on a server with
      multiple clients, with a persistence layer (most commonly in the form of
      the Hibernate Object Store) and with full authentication and
      authorization. (Note that these two phases do not have to be sequential,
      you might prefer to develop your system feature-by-feature right through
      to a deployable version.) In this section we show you how to run [[NAME]]
      Objects as prototype; in the next section we show you how to deploy the
      same domain object model as the real application.</para>

      <para>Running a [[NAME]] application generally requires some
      configuration files and images. Resources are typically loaded from the
      working directory, while specific resources can be loaded from the class
      path. Assuming that we will be running from the development directory
      the following structure is typical of a [[NAME]]
      application.</para>

      <literallayout>project/
    src/
    xat/
    config/
        isis.properties
        passwords
    images/
    build.xml
    :</literallayout>

      <section>
        <title>Configuration</title>

        <para>[[NAME]] loads in one or more properties files during
        startup. The properties files must contain at least a list of services
        that the application uses and commonly there is also a list of
        fixtures that are to be run at startup. In addition to the core
        properties there may be also other properties that are used by other
        components. The file <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">isis.properties</filename> is always loaded
        up, while other properties files relating to specific components are
        only loaded up if the component they relate to is to be is used. For
        example when using the DND viewer the system will also load in the
        file <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">viewer_dnd.properties</filename>, and when using the
        hibernate object store the file <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">persistor_hibernate.properties</filename> is loaded.
        While <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">isis.properies</filename> must exist for the
        framework to start up properly, all other properties files are
        optional.</para>

        <para>The example <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">isis.properties</filename> file below shows a
        number of service classes being listed along with a generic repository
        for accessing Location objects. The prefix is prepended to each class
        name before loading. The second set of properties lists the fixture
        classes to load and instantiate.</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">isis.services.prefix=org.apache.isis.example.ecs
isis.services=repository#Location,resources.CustomerRepository, \
  CustomerFactory, BookingFactory, resources.PaymentMethodFactory, \
  resources.PhoneNumberFactory, LocationFactory

isis.fixtures.prefix=org.apache.isis.example.ecs.fixtures
isis.fixtures=CitiesFixture, BookingsFixture, ContextFixture</programlisting>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Authentication</title>

        <para>By default the authentication mechanism is a username/password
        challenge with the details stored in a password file called <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">passwords</filename>. This file is a
        simple list of user names and their corresponding passwords separated
        by a colon. The file below shows two users with badly chosen
        passwords.</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">jbrown:pass
tsmith:pass</programlisting>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Images</title>

        <para>The drag and drop and web interfaces both display icons as part
        of the views for each object. Images for these icons, and for other
        uses, are sought in the <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">images</filename> directory. The web interface
        currently only works with GIF images, while the DnD interface will
        work with GIF, PNG and JPEG images. The following shows images for the
        main objects in the ECS example.</para>

        <literallayout>images
    Booking.gif
    City.gif
    CreditCard.gif
    Customer.gif
    Location.gif
    Telephone.gif
</literallayout>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Bootloader</title>

        <para>Running a [[NAME]] application is done via the [[NAME]]
        Objects boot loader, which is the class
        <literal>Isis</literal>. Without any arguments [[NAME]]
        Objects will be started in prototype mode with the Drag and Drop
        viewer. The example below shows the Ant target (from the build
        template file) that will start up [[NAME]] in exploration mode.
        The classpath is simply a list of all the library jars (as compiled by
        the <emphasis role="strong">path</emphasis> element) and the classes
        compiled by the <emphasis role="strong">compile</emphasis> target show
        previously.</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">&lt;property name="bootclass" value="org.apache.isis.runtime.Isis"/&gt;

&lt;path id="libs.external"&gt;

          that the server will listen using http using the encoding

        <title>Running as a WebApp</title>

        <para>[[NAME]] provides three different ways to run as a
        webapp:</para>

        <section>
          <title>Using isis.sh</title>

          <literallayout>$ isis.sh --type server --viewer html --persistor xml
2007-08-09 12:37:13.671::INFO:  Logging to STDERR via org.mortbay.log.StdErrLog

</literallayout>

          <para>This command runs the [[NAME]] with the HTML viewer,
          allowing multiple clients to access it via a browser. As for the
          standalone version the users need to access the URL
          http://<emphasis>server/logon.app</emphasis> to access the log on
          page.</para>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>Using WebServer bootstrap</title>

          <para>The next mechanism uses the
          <literal>org.apache.isis.webserver.WebServer</literal>
          bootstrap to run [[NAME]]. This loads up whatever is in the
          webapp project's <filename moreinfo="none">web.xml</filename> file.</para>

          <para><remark>TODO: we don't have a webserver.sh script to show this
          in action; we probably should.</remark></para>

          <para>Ordinarily the web.xml will be configured to run the same HTML
          viewer, so the end result will be the same. However, if necessary
          the remoting servlet can also be configured</para>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>Deploying as a WAR</title>

          <para>The final mechanism is to use Maven to package up the webapp
          project as a WAR file, packaging up whatever is in the web.xml file.
          As above, ordinarily the web.xml will be configured to run the same
          HTML viewer, so the end result will be the same. However, if
          necessary the remoting servlet can also be configured</para>

          <para>Packaging up is done using:</para>

          <literallayout>$ cd webapp
$ mvn clean package</literallayout>

          <para>This should result in a WAR file in
          <filename moreinfo="none">target</filename> directory. This can be deployed to an
          existing servlet containerd</para>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Setting up perspectives</title>

        <para>Perspectives allow the set of services available to a user (eg
        as icons in the DnD viewer) to be customized for that user. Since
        these services represent the "start points" for the user to interact
        with the domain model, they in a sense define an application on a
        per-user basis.</para>

        <para>The perspectives are stored in user-profiles, which are a
        persistence mechanism independent of the object store. (The intent is
        for user profiles to store additional information for use by viewers,
        for example allowing a user to reskin an application or change colors
        or fonts. As of NOF 4.0 the functionality provided is still limited,
        however).</para>

        <para>The key here is that if a user logs in and no perspective exists
        for that user then one will be created for them. The new perspective
        will be a copy of the 'template' perspective, or, if none was defined,
        a perspective containing all the known services. To create a template
        perspective add a perspective fixture that calls
        <literal>saveAsDefault()</literal>, rather than
        <literal>saveForUser()</literal> for a named user, as shown
        below.</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">public class PerspectivesFixture extends UserProfileFixture {
    @Override
    protected void installProfiles() {
        Profile profile = newUserProfile();
        Perspective perspective = profile.newPerspective("ECS");
        perspective.addToServices(LocationFactory.class);
        perspective.addToServices(CustomerRepository.class);
        perspective.addToServices(PaymentMethodFactory.class);
        
        saveAsDefault(profile);
    }
}
</programlisting>

        <para>With that set up, when a new user now logs in they will see
        three service icons on the screen for locations, customers and payment
        methods. On the drag and drop user interface the user can add and
        remove services from their perspective. To remove a service icon
        right-click on the grey border and select the close option. To add a
        service select the Services... option from the application menu
        (accessed by right-clicking on the application background) and drag
        the required service onto the desktop. Unfortunately there is no
        similar mechanism available on the HTML user interface so you will
        need to modify the created perspectives via the DND UI.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Adding authentication and authorization</title>

        <para><remark>TODO: this material seems to repeat a lot of what is in
        <xref linkend="managing_security"/>; should be merged and
        simplified.</remark></para>

        <para/>

        <para>Starting [[NAME]] requires a user name and password . (The
        exception is when running in exploration mode, which uses default
        values). The simplest way to specify the list of user names and
        passwords is in a passwords file.</para>

        <section>
          <title>Authentication using a passwords file</title>

          <para>Create a file called <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">password</filename>s, and place into the <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">config</filename> directory as the
          following example shows.</para>

          <literallayout>config/
   passwords
</literallayout>

          <para>The following example shows how user names (sven and dick) and
          corresponding passwords (passwd1 and passwd2) should be specified in
          the password file.</para>

          <programlisting format="linespecific">sven:passwd1
dick:passwd2</programlisting>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>Authorization using Allow and/or Disallow files</title>

          <para>Authorization allows access to actions and properties to be
          controlled by configuration. Authorization is entirely optional and
          is disabled by default - in which case every user is given access to
          all actions and properties. A prerequisite for authorization is for
          users to have roles. These should be added to the password file as
          follows.</para>

          <programlisting format="linespecific">sven:passwd1:ordinary_user
dick:passwd2:special_user|admin</programlisting>

          <para>Sven has the role 'ordinary_user', dick has the two roles
          'special_user' and 'admin'.</para>

          <para>[[NAME]] needs to be told which actions and properties
          are authorised for which roles. The simplest way to do this is in a
          file i.e. <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">allow</filename> in the config directory.</para>

          <literallayout>config/
   <emphasis role="strong">password</emphasis>
      <emphasis role="strong">allow</emphasis>
   </literallayout>

          <para>Each entry in the <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">allow</filename> file specifies either a class, or a
          particular action or property within a class, together with the
          roles that are allowed to access it. E.g.</para>

          <literallayout>example.dom.PhoneNumber#Number:ordinary_user|special_user
example.dom.Contact#Phones:ordinary_user|special_user
example.dom.Contact#FullName:ordinary_user|special_user
org.apache.isis.nof.core.service.SimpleRepository#FindByTitle(java.lang.String):ordinary_user|special_user
example.dom.PhoneNumber#Type:ordinary_user|special_user
example.dom.Contact#KnownAs:ordinary_user|special_user
org.apache.isis.nof.core.service.SimpleRepository#NewPersistentInstance():ordinary_user|special_user
example.dom.Contact#CreatePhone():special_user
org.apache.isis.nof.core.service.SimpleRepository#NewTransientInstance():ordinary_user|special_user
org.apache.isis.nof.core.service.SimpleRepository#AllInstances():ordinary_user|special_user
</literallayout>

          <para>The above file allows 'example.dom.Contact#CreatePhone()' only
          for users with role 'special_user' all other actions and properties
          are allowed for roles 'ordinary_user' and 'special_user'. A
          different, terser implementation of this would be to use separate
          <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">allow</filename> and
          <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">disallow</filename>
          files, or example, the <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">allow</filename> file:</para>

          <literallayout>example.dom.PhoneNumber:ordinary_user|special_user
example.dom.Contact:ordinary_user|special_user
org.apache.isis.nof.core.service.SimpleRepository:ordinary_user|special_user
</literallayout>

          <para>and the <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">disallow</filename> file:</para>

          <literallayout>example.dom.Contact#CreatePhone():ordinary_user</literallayout>

      <section>
        <title>Configuration</title>

        <para>No configuration is necessary for the simplest (file-based)
        authentication mechanism. For authorization the reflector needs to be
        decorated to look up the permissions every time the framework needs
        information about the visibility of fields and menus. To include the
        decorator add the following to a properties file.</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">isis.reflector.facet-decorators=file-security</programlisting>

        <para>If a <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">disallow</filename> file is to be used, this needs to
        be specified explicitly (the <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">allow</filename> file will be picked up
        automatically):</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">isis.security.blacklist.file=config/disallow</programlisting>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Adding support for internationalisation</title>

        <para>All the text that appears to the user comes from the domain
        object model. Any literal text used within the code may be
        externalised, and localised using the standard Java mechanism of
        resource bundles. However as all field and menu names are derived from
        the method names the framework provides a mechanism to adapt these
        names using resource bundles as well.</para>

        <section>
          <title>Localisation files</title>

          <para>Create a file for each required language, e.g., <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">i18n_en_GB.properties</filename>
          for English in Great Britain, and place them into the project such
          that they will be included in the class path. For the project
          structures we have already seen the files could be added to the
          <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">resources</filename>
          directory, as the following example shows.</para>

          <literallayout>resources/
   <emphasis role="strong">i18n_en_GB.properties
   i18n_de_DE.properties
   i18n_fr_FR.properties</emphasis>
   </literallayout>

          <para>The following example is part of one of those translation file
          and shows how property and action names and descriptions may be
          specified.</para>

          <programlisting format="linespecific">example.dom.Contact.property.Phone.name=Téléphone
example.dom.Contact.action.NewPhone.name=Nouveau téléphone
example.dom.Contact.property.FullName.description=Le nom complet du client</programlisting>

        </section>

        <section>
          <title>Configuration</title>

          <para>The reflector needs to be decorated with a facet decorator to
          look up the translated names every time the framework needs
          information about the fields and menus. To include the decorator add
          the following to a properties file.</para>

          <programlisting format="linespecific">isis.reflector.facet-decorators=resource-i18n</programlisting>

          <para>If the application is being accessed via the web (html)
          viewer, then the server will need to perform the localisation, so
          the above property should be included in one of
          isis.properties read by the server; if the application is
          being accessed by a client (e.g. the DND viewer) then the
          localisation will be performed within the client, and the property
          should be specified in one of the properties files read by the
          client e.g. <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">facet-decorator_i18n.properties</filename>.</para>

          <para>The locale will be picked up automatically from the machine on
          which the code is executing. You may override this by specifying the
          <link linkend="locale">locale</link> in a properties file.</para>

      <title>Managing security</title>

      <para>[[NAME]] supports authentication  and role-based
      authorization. Within the framework the user is represented by a
      <literal>Session</literal> object. From the session object you can
      get the name of the user and their roles.</para>

      <para>The session is used within the distribution mechanism and the
      security manager. The security manager uses the session to determine if
      a user can access or manipulate an object member. The distribution
      mechanism passes the session to the server so the server knows which
      user is accessing it.</para>

        <para>An <literal>Authoriser</literal> processes an

          <title>Authentication through a passwords file</title>

          <para>To explicitly use file-based authentication set the following

          <programlisting format="linespecific">isis.authentication=file</programlisting>

          <para>The location and name of the passwords file may be specified
          explicitly - if not it defaults to the <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">passwords</filename> file, assumed to be in the
          <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">config</filename>
          directory (or under WEB-INF if running as a web application).</para>

        <title id="authorization">Authorization</title>

        <para>As with authentication, authorization may be executed via a
        file, LDAP, or database. If no authorization mechanism is specified,
        all domain calls, methods and properties will be available to all
        users.</para>

        <section>
          <title>Authorization through 'allow' and 'disallow' files</title>

          <para>To enable authorization by file including the facet and
          specifying the authorization implementation in the settings</para>

          <programlisting format="linespecific">isis.reflector.facets.include=\
    org.apache.isis.runtime.authorization.standard.AuthorizationFacetFactoryImpl
isis.authorization=file</programlisting>

          <para>With file authorization the current user's role will be
          authorised against a white and (optionally) a black list for each
          method possibly available to them. The files are identified by
          properties, e.g.</para>

          <programlisting format="linespecific">isis.authorization.file.whitelist=allow
isis.authorization.file.blacklist=disallow  </programlisting>

          <para>The white list file is mandatory, if there is no property it
          defaults to 'allow' (picked up from the config directory or from
          WEB-INF if running as a webapp). The black list file is optional.
          The presence of the property indicates it is being used. If the
          white list file default is being used then 'disallow' is suggested
          as a setting for the black list.</para>

          <para>Each file contains a signature to match against and a list of
          roles. A match in the white list file permits the method and match
          in the black list forbids it. The black list overrides the white
          list. Matching occurs at three levels class, method (or property)
          and parameters. Property matches are to the bean property name e.g.
          'phone' for getPhone and setPhone.</para>

          <para>Formatted as follows:</para>

          <para>If only class is to be matched: &lt;fully qualified class&gt;
          :role1|role2|..</para>

          <para>Class and method: &lt;fully qualified
          class&gt;#&lt;method&gt;:role1|role2|..</para>

          <para>Class and property: &lt;fully qualified
          class&gt;#&lt;property&gt;:role1|role2|..</para>

          <para>Parameters where method takes no parameters: &lt;fully
          qualified class&gt;#&lt;method&gt;():role1|role2|...</para>

          <para>Parameters where method takes one parameter: &lt;fully
          qualified class&gt;#&lt;method&gt;(fully qualified parameter
          class):role1|role2|...</para>

          <para>Parameters where method takes two or more:</para>

          <para>&lt;fully qualified class&gt;#&lt;method&gt;(fully qualified
          parameter class1, fully qualified parameter class2,
          ...):role1|role2|...</para>

          <para>Each line in the file is a separate match.</para>

          <para>So, for example, in the white list file</para>

          <programlisting format="linespecific">com.isisgroup.expenses.services.hibernate.ClaimRepositoryHibernate:role1 </programlisting>

          <para>will permit all actions/properties on <literal moreinfo="none">com.isisgroup.expenses.services.hibernate.ClaimRepositoryHibernate</literal>

          <programlisting format="linespecific">com.isisgroup.expenses.services.hibernate.
    ClaimantRepositoryHibernate#findClaimantByName:role1|role2</programlisting>

          <para>will permit all overloaded methods named <literal moreinfo="none">findClaimantByName</literal> on <literal moreinfo="none">com.isisgroup.expenses.services.hibernate.ClaimantRepositoryHibernate</literal>
          for role1 and role2 and</para>

          <programlisting format="linespecific">com.isisgroup.expenses.services.hibernate.ClaimantRepositoryHibernate#findClaimantByIdentifier(java.lang.String):role3</programlisting>

          <para>will permit <literal moreinfo="none">findClaimantByIdentifier</literal> with parameter

          for role3. In each case an identical entry in the black list file
          will instead make the action or property unavailable. The
          combination of white and black list allows some economy in the
          settings. For example, if all but one method of a large class is to
          be allowed, that could be configured with one entry per method in
          the white list file or, better, a single entry for the class in the
          white list and a single entry for the unavailable method in the
          black list.</para>

          <programlisting format="linespecific">isis.reflector.facets.include=\

          <para>With LDAP authorization the current user's role will be
          authorised against an entry in the LDAP server for each method
          possibly available to them. The URL of the server is obtained from
          the same property as for authentication.</para>

          <para>The authorization entries should exist under a DN configured

          <programlisting format="linespecific">isis.authorization.ldap.application.dn= cn=expenses, dc=apps, dc=isis, dc=org </programlisting>

          <para>This will be checked anonymously.</para>

          <para>Entries to be matched against should exist under this dn.
          Expected configuration is a hierarchy of class, method and
          parameters. The cn of each entry is expected to be the fully
          qualified class name, method or parameter list ('()' for an empty
          parameter list). If an entry has a 'uniquemember' attribute equal to
          'role' then that entry and all sub-entries are authorised.</para>

          <para>For example</para>

          <para>DN:

          <para>In the same way as database authentication, database
          authorization is dependent upon hibernate. The authorization table
          should exist in the database configured in the hibernate.cfg.xml

          described as follows.</para>

          <programlisting format="linespecific">CREATE TABLE permissions (id INTEGER  NOT NULL, role INTEGER  NOT NULL,permission VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, flags INTEGER, PRIMARY KEY (id));</programlisting>

          <title>Separate visibility and usability authorization</title>

          <para>There is an optional capability to authorise the visibility
          and usability of fields independently. Thus a field may be visible
          to certain roles but not editable. In order to configure this
          against a authorization a flag must be added as follows.</para>

          <section>
            <title>File authorization</title>

            <para>Add a "-rw" suffix to any role in the allow or disallow
            files. "-rw" will match (and hence allow in the allow file,
            disallow in the disallow file) edit authorization requests.</para>
          </section>

          <section>
            <title>Database authorization</title>

          <section>
            <title>Ldap authorization</title>

            <para>Add a flags attribute to the entry with the role. If it's
            set to 'rw' editing will be allowed, any other value (typically
            'ro') will disallow editing.</para>

            <para>In each case absence of the flag will mean that visibility

          <para>When this is present and set, all methods will be authorised
          for all roles. However as each method is accessed through the user
          interface authorization will be configured for that method and the

      <title>Recognised Methods</title>

      <para>The Java 1.5 reflector allows the domain modeller to define
      behaviourally complete domain objects, provide maximum feedback to the
      user, and control any interaction that may take place (rather than place
      that code in each and every user interface and back-end). This sections
      lists the explicit methods that are recognised by the standard
      reflector. All methods must be <code>public</code> to be
      recognised.</para>

      <para>Methods that do not get matched with any of the listed rules are
      deemed to be action methods that we expect the user to invoke via the
      user interface. These are public methods, of the following format</para>

      <programlisting format="linespecific">public void &lt;actionName&gt;([&lt;property type&gt; param]...)
public &lt;type&gt; &lt;actionName&gt;([&lt;property type&gt; param]...)</programlisting>

      <para>that are not used for fields, titles, or for controlling other
      methods. Essentially they are the methods left over from generating all
      other aspects of the class.</para>

      <para>When such a method returns a reference the framework will attempt
      to display that object. If an action method returns <literal moreinfo="none">null</literal> then nothing will be displayed.</para>

        <para>Used in conjunction with a collection, the <literal moreinfo="none">addTo</literal> method is called by the framework when
        the user adds an element to the collection. By providing this method
        in conjunction with a non-generic collection it will be limited to a
        specific type (rather than being used to store references of type
        <literal>Object</literal>). This behaviour is similar to that of
        the <literal>modify</literal> method for properties.</para>

        <para>Used in conjunction with a property, the
        <literal>choices</literal> method provides the user with a set
        of options for setting a property. This method is called when the user
        interface makes the options available, hence its return value can be
        based on the current state of the object. Note - this does not limit
        the state of the field, see the <literal>validate</literal>

        <para>The <literal>choices</literal> method provides a set of
        options for the parameters of an action. This method is called when
        the user interface prompts for the parameters from the user, so the

        <para>The <literal moreinfo="none">set</literal> method is called when
        the property is changed, either by the user or the framework. As the
        framework calls the same method when recreating the object from
        persistent data it is important to avoid doing any work in the

        <para>Complements a get/set method for a value or reference
        property.</para>

        <para>This <literal>validate</literal> method is used to check
        the value/reference that is to be used to set a property. Using such a
        mechanism the programmer can guarantee that a field never becomes
        invalid. If a <literal>String</literal> object is returned the
        value/reference is consider to be invalid and the field will not be
        set. The string itself will then be made visible to the user to inform
        them why it is invalid. If the method returns <literal moreinfo="none">null</literal> then property will be set, that is, its

        <para>Complements a get method for a collection property.</para>

        <para>This <literal>validate</literal> method is used to check
        that the specified object can be added to or removed from a
        collection. Using such a mechanism the programmer can guarantee that
        the collection never becomes invalid. If a
        <literal>String</literal> object is returned then adding/removing
        the specified object is not valid and the collection will not be
        changed. The string itself will then be made visible to the user to
        inform them why changing the collection with the object would be
        invalid. If the method returns <literal moreinfo="none">null</literal>
        then the object will be added to/removed from the collection, that is,
        from the collection object directly if there is no
        <literal>addTo</literal>/<literal>removeFrom</literal>
        method, or via a call to the
        <literal>addTo</literal>/<literal>removeFrom</literal>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">public String validate&lt;actionName&gt;([&lt;parameter type&gt; param]...)</programlisting>

        <para>Complements an action method.</para>

        <para>This <literal>validate</literal> method is used to check
        that the actions parameters are all valid and that the action method
        can be safely invoked, that is, if it is invoked that it will not
        fail. If a <literal>String</literal> object is returned then the
        action should not be invoked. The string itself will then be made
        visible to the user to inform them why the method cannot be invoked.
        If the method returns <literal moreinfo="none">null</literal> then the
        action method will be invoked with the same set of parameters.</para>

        <bridgehead>Ensure object is in a valid state to be saved</bridgehead>

        <para>A validate() method may be added to provided validation at
        object level - prior to making an object persistent.</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">public String validate()</programlisting>

        <para>This is particularly useful for validating fields in relation to
        each other, as in the following example:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">public class Booking {
    private Date fromDate;
    public Date getFromDate() {...}
    public void setFromDate(Date d) {...}
    
    private Date toDate;
    public Date getToDate() {...}
    public void setToDate(Date d) {...}

    public String validate() {
        if (fromDate &gt; toDate) {
            return "From Date cannot be after To Date";
        }
        return null;
    }
    ...
}</programlisting>

        <para>This will prevent the user from saving a transient
        <code>Booking</code> where the From Date falls after the To Date. Note
        that in this example, the two date properties could also have their
        own individual validate methods - for example in order to test that
        each date was after today.</para>

        <warning>
          <para>At the time of writing, the <code>validate</code> method is
          called only when the object is first saved, not when it is
          subsequently updated. For validation of subsequent updates, it is
          necessary to build the validation logic into the individual property
          validation methods, though these could delegate to a common
          <code>validate</code> method.</para>

        <title>@ActionOrder</title>

        <para>Note: The recommended mechanism for specifying the order in
        which actions are listed to the user is <code>@MemberOrder</code> (see
        below). <code>@ActionOrder</code> provides an alternative mechanism,
        in which the order is specified in one place in the class, with the
        added advantage (currently) that you can easily specify groupings
        (which may be rendered by the viewer as sub-menus). However,
        <code>@ActionOrder</code> is more 'brittle' to change: if you change
        the name of an existing action you will need to ensure that the
        corresponding name within the <code>@ActionOrder</code> annotation is
        also changed.</para>

        <para>The syntax is: <literal moreinfo="none">@ActionOrder("&lt;comma
        separated list of action names&gt;")</literal> (the action names are
        not case sensitive).</para>

        <para>For example:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific"><emphasis role="strong">@ActionOrder("PlaceNewOrder, CheckCredit")</emphasis>
public class Customer {

    public Order placeNewOrder() {}

    public CreditRating checkCredit() {}

...
}</programlisting>

        <para>Actions can be grouped together by surrounding the group with
        brackets, and prefixing the group with name and colon. This
        information may be used by the viewing mechanism to render actions
        into sub-menus. For example:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific"><emphasis role="strong">@ActionOrder("(Account Management: PlaceOrder, CheckCredit), (Personal Details: ChangeOfAddress, AddEmail)")</emphasis>
public class Customer {

    public Order placeNewOrder() {}

    public CreditRating checkCredit() {}

    public void changeOfAddress() {}

    public void addEmail(String emailAddress) {}

    ...
}</programlisting>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>@Bounded</title>

        <para>For immutable objects where there is a bounded set of instances,
        the <literal moreinfo="none">@Bounded</literal> annotation can be
        used. For example:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific"><emphasis role="strong">@Bounded</emphasis>
public class County {
    // members and actions here
}</programlisting>

        <para>The number of instances is expected to be small enough that all
        instance can be held in memory. The viewer will use this information
        to render all the instances of this class in a drop-down list or
        equivalent. (Note: Although this is not enforced, <literal moreinfo="none">@Bounded</literal> is intended for use on <literal moreinfo="none">final</literal> classes. Its behaviour when used on
        interfaces, or classes with sub-classes is not specified).</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>@Debug</title>

        <para>The <literal>@Debug </literal>annotation marks an action
        method as available in debug mode only, and so will not normally be
        displayed by the user interface.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>@DescribedAs</title>

        <para>The <literal moreinfo="none">@DescribedAs</literal> annotation
        is used to provide a short description of something that features on
        the user interface. How this description is used will depend upon the
        viewing mechanism - but it may be thought of as being like a 'tool
        tip'. Descriptions may be provided for objects, members (properties,
        collections and actions), and for individual parameters within an
        action method. <literal moreinfo="none">@DescribedAs</literal>
        therefore works in a very similar manner to <literal moreinfo="none">@Named</literal>.</para>

        <bridgehead>Providing a description for an object</bridgehead>

        <para>To provide a description for an object, use the <literal moreinfo="none">@DescribedAs</literal> annotation immediately before
        the declaration of that object class. For example:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific"><emphasis role="strong">@DescribedAs("A Customer who may have originally become known to us via " +
             "the marketing system or who may have contacted us directly.")</emphasis>
public class ProspectiveSale {
   ...
}</programlisting>

        <bridgehead>Providing a description for a member</bridgehead>

        <para>Any member (property, collection or action) may provide a
        description. To specify this description, use the <literal moreinfo="none">@DescribedAs</literal> annotation immediately before
        the declaration of that member. For example:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">public class Customer {
    <emphasis role="strong">@DescribedAs("The name that the customer has indicated that they wish to be " +
                 "addressed as (e.g. Johnny rather than Jonathan)")</emphasis>
    public String getFirstName() { ... }
}</programlisting>

        <bridgehead>Providing a description for an action
        parameter</bridgehead>

        <para>To provide a description for an individual action parameter, use
        the <literal moreinfo="none">@DescribedAs</literal> annotation in-line
        i.e. immediately before the parameter declaration. For example:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">public class Customer {
    public Order placeOrder(
                      Product product,
                      @Named("Quantity")
                      <emphasis role="strong">@DescribedAs("The quantity of the product being ordered")</emphasis>
                      int quantity) {

        Order order = new Order();
        order.modifyCustomer(this);
        order.modifyProduct(product);
        order.setQuantity(quantity);        
        return order;
    }
    ...
}</programlisting>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>@Disabled</title>

        <para>The <literal moreinfo="none">@Disabled</literal> annotation
        means that the member cannot be used in any instance of the class.
        When applied to the property it means that the user may not modify the
        value of that property (though it may still be modified
        programmatically). When applied to an action method, it means that the
        user cannot invoke that method. For example:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">public class Customer {
    <emphasis role="strong">@Disabled</emphasis>
    public void assessCreditWorthiness() { ... }

    <emphasis role="strong">@Disabled</emphasis>
    public int getInitialCreditRating(){ ... }
    public void setInitialCreditRating(int initialCreditRating) { ... }
}</programlisting>

        <para>Note that if an action is marked as <literal moreinfo="none">@Disabled</literal>, it will be shown on the user
        interface but cannot ever be invoked. One possible reason to do this
        is during prototyping, to indicate an action that is still to be
        developed. If a method is intended for programmatic use, but not
        intended ever to be invoked directly by a user, then it should be
        marked as <literal moreinfo="none">@Hidden</literal> instead.</para>

        <para>This annotation can also take a single parameter indicating when
        it is to be hidden, for example the following code would disable the
        action until the object has been saved.</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">public class Customer {
    <emphasis role="strong">@Disabled</emphasis>(When.UNTIL_PERSISTED)
    public void assessCreditWorthiness() { ... }
}</programlisting>

        <para>The acceptable values for the parameter are:
        <code>When.ALWAYS</code>, <code>When.NEVER</code>,
        <code>When.ONCE_PERSISTED</code> and
        <code>When.UNTIL_PERSISTED</code>. By default the annotated property
        or action is always disabled i.e. it is implicitly
        <code>When.ALWAYS.</code></para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>@Executed</title>

        <para>The <literal>@Executed</literal> annotation overrides the
        default location where a method is executed.</para>

        <bridgehead>Forcing a method to be executed on the client</bridgehead>

        <para>The <literal>@Executed(Where.LOCALLY)</literal> annotation
        marks an action method so that it executes on the client, rather than
        being forwarded to the server for execution. This is useful for
        methods that invoke a service that must be run client-side, for
        example spawning off a separate process (such as a web browser or
        Acrobat Reader).</para>

        <bridgehead>Forcing a method to be executed on the server</bridgehead>

        <para>The <literal>@Executed(Where.REMOTELY)</literal> annotation
        marks an action method so that it executes on the server, even though
        it would normally be executed on the client (as methods for transient
        objects are). This is useful for methods that although based on
        transient objects need access to persistent objects.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>@Exploration</title>

        <para>The <literal>@Exploration</literal> annotation marks an
        action method as available in exploration mode only, and therefore not
        intended for use in the production system</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>@FieldOrder</title>

        <para>Note: The recommended mechanism for specifying the order in
        which fields are listed to the user is <code>@MemberOrder</code> (see
        below). <code>@FieldOrder</code> provides an alternative mechanism, in
        which the order is specified in one place in the class. However,
        <code>@FieldOrder</code> is more 'brittle' to change: if you change
        the name of an existing property you will need to ensure that the
        corresponding name within the <code>@FieldOrder</code> annotation is
        also changed.</para>

        <para>The syntax is: <literal moreinfo="none">@FieldOrder("&lt;comma
        separated list of field names&gt;") </literal>(the field names are not
        case sensitive.).</para>

        <para>For example:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific"><emphasis role="strong">@FieldOrder("Name, Address, DateOfBirth, RecentOrders")</emphasis>
public class Customer {

    public Date getDateOfBirth() {...}

    public List&lt;Order&gt; getRecentOrders() {...}

    public String getAddress() {...}

    public String getName() {...}

    ...
}</programlisting>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>@Hidden</title>

        <para>The <literal moreinfo="none">@Hidden</literal> annotation
        indicates that the member (property, collection or action) to which it
        is applied should never be visible to the user. For example:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">public class Customer {
    private int internalId;

    <emphasis role="strong">@Hidden</emphasis>
    public int getInternalId() {
        return internalId;
    }

    <emphasis role="strong">@Hidden</emphasis>
    public void updateStatus() { ... }
}</programlisting>

        <para>This annotation can also take a single parameter indicating when
        it is to be hidden, for example the following code would show the Id
        until the object has been saved, and then would hide it.</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">public class Customer {
    private int internalId;

    <emphasis role="strong">@Hidden</emphasis>(When.ONCE_PERSISTED)
    public int getInternalId() {
        return internalId;
    }
}</programlisting>

        <para>The acceptable values for the parameter are:
        <code>When.ALWAYS</code>, <code>When.NEVER</code>,
        <code>When.ONCE_PERSISTED</code> and
        <code>When.UNTIL_PERSISTED</code>. By default the annotated property
        or action is always hidden i.e. it is implicitly
        <code>When.ALWAYS.</code></para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>@Immutable</title>

        <para>The <literal moreinfo="none">@Immutable</literal> annotation may
        be applied to a class. The framework does not allow the state of such
        objects to be changed through the UI, and it should be considered a
        programmer error to do so programmatically. The ObjectStorePersistor,
        as used to run the in-memory and Hibernate object stores will actually
        fail if the programmer tries to change an object in a way that cause
        the persistor to try and save it. For example the following class
        would prevent the user from changing the object even when
        transient:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific"><emphasis role="strong">@Immutable</emphasis>
public class Country {
    ...
}</programlisting>

        <para>This annotation can also take a single parameter indicating when
        it is to become immutable, for example the following code would allow
        the user to create an email object and set it up, and then prevent any
        changes once it has been saved.</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific"><emphasis role="strong">@Immutable</emphasis>(When.ONCE_PERSISTED)
public class Email {
    ...
}</programlisting>

        <para>The acceptable values for the parameter are:
        <code>When.ALWAYS</code>, <code>When.NEVER</code>,
        <code>When.ONCE_PERSISTED</code> and
        <code>When.UNTIL_PERSISTED</code>. By default the annotated property
        or action is always immutable i.e. it is implicitly
        <code>When.ALWAYS.</code></para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title id="mask-annotation">@Mask</title>

        <para>The <literal moreinfo="none">@Mask </literal>annotation may be
        applied to any property, or to any parameter within an action method,
        that allows the user to type in text as input. The mask serves to
        validate, and potentially to normalise, the format of the input. The
        characters that can be used are based on Swing's MaskFormatter, and
        also Java's SimpleDateFormat. When applying a mask to a value
        property, the annotation should be applied to the 'getter'. For
        example:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">public class Email {
    private String telNo;

    <emphasis role="strong">@Mask("(NNN)NNN-NNNN")</emphasis>
    public String getTelephoneNumber() {...}

    public void setTelephoneNumber(String telNo) {...}
    ...
}</programlisting>

        <para>When applying a mask to a value parameter within an action
        method, the annotation should be applied 'in-line' before that
        parameter). For example:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">public void newContact(
     @Named("Contact Name")
     String contactName,
     @Named("Telephone Number")
     <emphasis role="strong">@Mask("(NNN)NNN-NNNN")</emphasis>
     String telNo) {}</programlisting>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>@MaxLength</title>

        <para>The <literal moreinfo="none">@MaxLength</literal> annotation
        indicates the maximum number of characters that the user may enter
        into a <literal moreinfo="none">String</literal> property, or a
        <literal moreinfo="none">String</literal> parameter in an action. (It
        is ignored if applied to a property or parameter of any other type.)
        For example:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">public class Customer {

    <emphasis role="strong">@MaxLength(30)</emphasis>
    public String getFirstName() { ... }
    public void setFirstName(String firstName) { ... }
    ...
}</programlisting>

        <para>If the model is being persisted on a relational database then
        <literal moreinfo="none">@MaxLength</literal> should be specified for
        all <literal moreinfo="none">String</literal> properties and action
        parameters.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>@MemberOrder</title>

        <para><code>@MemberOrder</code> is the recommended mechanism for
        specifying the order in which fields and/or actions are presented to
        the user. (<code>@ActionOrder</code> and <code>@FieldOrder</code>
        provide alternative mechanisms).</para>

        <para><code>@MemberOrder</code> is specified at the individual member
        level, on a 'relative' basis. The syntax is:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">@MemberOrder(sequence = "&lt;relative order&gt;")</programlisting>

        <para>where <code>&lt;relative order&gt;</code> may be any string. The
        actual sequence is determined by comparing all the values of the
        sequence specifier string, using the standard <code>String</code>
        comparator.</para>

        <para>The simplest convention is to use numbers - 1, 2, 3 - though it
        is a better idea to leave gaps in the numbers - 10, 20, 30 perhaps -
        such that a new member may be added without having to edit existing
        numbers. A useful alternative is to adopt the 'dot-decimal' notation -
        1, 1.1, 1.2, 2, 3, 5.1.1, 5.2.2, 5.2, 5.3 - which allows for an
        indefinite amount of future insertion. For example:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">Public Class Customer {
    @MemberOrder(sequence="2.1")
    Public String getAddress() {...}
    Public void setAddress(value as String) {...}

    @MemberOrder(sequence="1.1")
    Public String getFirstName() {...}
    Public void setFirstName(value as String) {...}

    @MemberOrder(sequence="1.2")
    Public String getLastName() {...}
    Public void setLastName(value as String) {...}

    @MemberOrder(sequence="3")
    Public Date getDateOfBirth() {...}
    Public void setDateOfBirth(value as Date) {...}
    ...
}   </programlisting>

        <para>If a member does not have a specified order then it will be
        placed after those that are specified. Two members may have the same
        sequence specifier, but in such a case the relative ordering of those
        members will be indeterminate.</para>

        <para>This approach is especially useful when dealing with inheritance
        hierarchies, as it allows sub-classes to specify where their
        additional members should be placed in relation to those inherited
        from the super-class.</para>

        <para>Note that certain styles of user interface will lay out an
        object's properties and its collections separately, in which case the
        relative member order of properties and collections will be evaluated
        separately. However, since other styles of user interface may
        interleave properties and collections, it is safer to assume the
        latter.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>@MultiLine</title>

        <para>The <literal moreinfo="none">@MultiLine</literal> annotation
        provides information about the carriage returns in a <literal moreinfo="none">String</literal> property or action parameter. The
        annotation indicates that:</para>

        <para>- the <code>String</code> property or parameter may contain
        carriage returns, and</para>

        <para>- (optionally) the typical number of such carriage returns,
        and</para>

        <para>- (optionally) that the text should be wrapped (the default is
        that text is not wrapped).</para>

        <warning>
          <para>Currently the <literal moreinfo="none">preventWrapping</literal> functionality is not fully
          implemented.</para>
        </warning>

        <para>This may be used by the viewing mechanism to render the property
        as a multi-line textbox (or text-editor when changes are permitted),
        with appropriate wrapping and/or scrollbars. The syntax is:</para>

        <para><literal moreinfo="none">@MultiLine([numberOfLines=&lt;typicalNumberOfCRs&gt;]
        [,preventWrapping=&lt;false|true&gt;])</literal></para>

        <para>For example:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">public class BugReport {
    <emphasis role="strong">@MultiLine(numberOfLines=10)</emphasis>
    public String getStepsToReproduce() { ... }
    public void setStepsToReproduce(String stepsToReproduce) { ... }
    ...
}</programlisting>

        <para>Here the <literal moreinfo="none">stepsToReproduce</literal> may
        be displayed in a text area of 10 rows, with no wrapping. A horizontal
        scrollbar may appear if the number of characters on any given row
        exceeds the width. Another example:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">public class Email {
    <emphasis role="strong">@MultiLine(numberOfLines=20, preventWrapping=false)</emphasis>
    public String getBody() { ... }
    public void setBody(String body) { ... }
    ...
}</programlisting>

        <para>Here the body should be displayed in a text area of 20 rows,
        with wrapping. If this attribute is combined with the <literal moreinfo="none">&lt;TypicalLength&gt;</literal>, then the expected
        width of the text area in the user interface will be determined by the
        value of the typical length divided by the number of specified lines.
        For example:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">public class Email {
    <emphasis role="strong">@MultiLine(numberOfLines=20, preventWrapping=false)</emphasis>
    @TypicalLength(800)
    public String getBody() { ... }
    public void setBody(String body) { ... }
    ...
}</programlisting>

        <para>Here the body will (likely be) displayed in a text area of 20
        rows, with 40 columns.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>@MustSatisfy</title>

        <para>The <literal moreinfo="none">@MustSatisfy</literal> annotation
        allows validation to be applied to properties using an (implementation
        of a)
        <literal>org.apache.isis.applib.spec.Specification</literal>
        object.</para>

        <para>For example:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">public class Customer {
    <emphasis role="strong">@MustSatisfy(StartWithCapitalLetterSpecification.class)</emphasis>
    public String getFirstName() { ... }

    ...
}</programlisting>

        <para>The <literal>Specification</literal> is consulted during
        validation, being passed the proposed value.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>@Named</title>

        <para>The <literal moreinfo="none">@Named</literal> annotation is used
        when you want to specify the way something is named on the user
        interface i.e. when you do not want to use the name generated
        automatically by the system. It can be applied to objects, members
        (properties, collections, and actions) and to parameters within an
        action method.</para>

        <para><warning>
            <para>Generally speaking it is better to rename the property,
            collection or action. The only common case where
            <literal moreinfo="none">@Named</literal> is common is to rename parameters for
            built-in value types. Even here though a custom value type can be
            defined using <literal>@Value</literal> so that the value type
            is used as the parameter name. @Named may also be used if the name
            needs punctuation or other symbols in the name presented to the
            user.</para>
          </warning></para>

        <bridgehead>Specifying the name of an object</bridgehead>

        <para>By default the name of an object is derived, reflectively from
        the class name. To specify a different name for an object, use the
        <literal moreinfo="none">@Named</literal> annotation in front of the
        class declaration. For example:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific"><emphasis role="strong">@Named("Customer")</emphasis>
public class CustomerImpl implements Customer{
   ...
}</programlisting>

        <para>See also: <literal moreinfo="none">@Plural</literal>.</para>

        <bridgehead>Specifying the name of a member</bridgehead>

        <para>By default, the name of a member (a property, collection or
        action) presented to the user is derived, reflectively, from the name
        of the member defined in the program code. To specify a different name
        use the <literal moreinfo="none">@Named </literal>annotation
        immediately before the member declaration. For example:</para>

        <bridgehead>Specifying the name for an action parameter</bridgehead>

        <para>The most common usage of <literal moreinfo="none">@Named
        </literal>will be to specify names for the parameters of an action:
        because, by default, the user interface will use the type of the
        parameter as the name. (This is because the parameter name declared in
        the code for the action method cannot be picked up reflectively.) To
        specify the name of a parameter, the <literal moreinfo="none">@Named</literal> annotation is applied 'in-line' (i.e.
        preceding the individual parameter declaration). For example:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">public class Customer {

    public Order placeOrder(
                      Product product,
                      <emphasis role="strong">@Named("Quantity")</emphasis>
                      int quantity) {

        Order order = new Order();
        order.modifyCustomer(this);
        order.modifyProduct(product);
        order.setQuantity(quantity);        
        return order;
    }
    ...
}</programlisting>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>@NotPersistable</title>

        <para>This annotation indicates that transient instances of this class
        may be created but may not be persisted. The framework will not
        provide the user with an option to 'save' the object, and attempting
        to persist such an object programmatically would be an error. For
        example:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific"><emphasis role="strong">@NotPersistable</emphasis>
public class InputForm {
    // members and actions here
}</programlisting>

        <para>This annotation can also take a single parameter indicating
        whether it is only the user that cannot persist the object, for
        example the following code would prevent the user from saving the
        object (via the viewer) but still allow the program to persist the
        object. By default the annotated object is effectively transient, e.g.
        it is implicitly
        <literal>By</literal>.<varname>USER_OR_PROGRAM</varname>.</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific"><emphasis role="strong">@NotPersistable</emphasis>(By.USER)
public class InputForm {
    ...
}</programlisting>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>@NotPersisted</title>

        <para>This indicates that the property is not to be persisted. Note
        that in many cases the same thing could be achieved by providing the
        property with a 'getter' but no 'setter'. For example:</para>

        <remark>Check that this is acceptable for Hibernate</remark>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">public class Order {

    private Order previousOrder;

    <emphasis role="strong">@NotPersisted</emphasis>
    public Order getPreviousOrder() {...}

    public void setPreviousOrder(Order previousOrder) {...}

    // rest of code
}</programlisting>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>@Optional</title>

        <para>By default, the system assumes that all properties of an object
        are required, and therefore will not let the user save a new object
        unless a value has been specified for each property. Similarly, by
        default, the system assumes that all parameters in an action are
        required and will not let the user execute that action unless values
        have been specified for each parameter. To indicate that either a
        property, or an action parameter, is optional, use the <literal moreinfo="none">@Optional</literal> annotation.</para>

        <bridgehead>Making a property optional</bridgehead>

        <para>To indicate that a property is optional (i.e. that the user may
        save the object without necessarily specifying a value for this
        property), use the @Optional annotation immediately before the
        declaration of that property. For example:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">public class Order {
    public Product getProduct() { ... }
    
    public java.util.Date getShipDate() { ... }
    public void setShipDate(Date java.util.shipDate) { ... }

    <emphasis role="strong">@Optional</emphasis>
    public String getComments() { ... }
    public void setComments(String comments) { ... }
}</programlisting>

        <para>Here the <literal moreinfo="none">product</literal> and <literal moreinfo="none">shipDate</literal> properties are both required, but
        the <literal moreinfo="none">comments</literal> property is
        optional.</para>

        <bridgehead>Making an action parameter optional</bridgehead>

        <para>To indicate that an action may be invoked without having to
        specify a value for a particular parameter, the
        <literal moreinfo="none">@Optional</literal> annotation should be used in-line i.e.
        immediately before the declaration of that parameter. For
        example:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">public class Customer {
    public Order placeOrder(
              Product product,
              @Named("Quantity") int quantity, 
              @Optional @Named("Special Instructions") String instr) {
        ....
    }
    ...
}</programlisting>

        <para>Note that the <literal moreinfo="none">@Optional</literal>annotation has no meaning for a
        primitive property (or parameter) such as <literal moreinfo="none">int</literal> - because primitives will always return
        a default value (e.g. zero). If optionality is required, then use the
        corresponding wrapper class (e.g. java.lang.Integer).</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>@Plural</title>

        <para>Where [[NAME]] displays a collection of several objects it
        may use the plural form of the object type in the title. By default
        the plural name will be created by adding an 's' to the end of the
        singular name (whether that is the class name or another name
        specified using <literal moreinfo="none">@Named</literal>). Where the
        single name ends in 'y' then the default plural name will end in 'ies'
        - for example a collection of <literal moreinfo="none">Country</literal> objects will be titled 'Countries'.
        Where these conventions do not work, the programmer may specify the
        plural form of the name using @Plural. For example:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific"><emphasis role="strong">@Plural("Children")</emphasis>
public class Child {
    // members and actions here
}</programlisting>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>@RegEx</title>

        <para>The <literal moreinfo="none">@RegEx</literal> annotation may be
        applied to any property, or to any parameter within an action method,
        that is a value type (i.e. that allows the user to type in text as
        input). It serves both to validate and potentially to normalise the
        format of the input. <literal moreinfo="none">@Regex</literal> is
        therefore similar in use to <literal moreinfo="none">@Mask</literal>
        but provides more flexibility. The syntax is:</para>

        <para><literal moreinfo="none">@RegEx(validation = &lt;regEx
        string&gt;, format = &lt;regEx string&gt;, caseSensitive =
        &lt;true|false&gt;)</literal></para>

        <para>The first parameter is required; the format defaults to 'no
        formatting'; caseSensitive defaults to false. When applying Regex to a
        value property, the annotation should be applied to the 'getter'. For
        example:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">    private String email;

<emphasis role="strong">    @RegEx(validation = "(\\w+\\.)*\\w+@(\\w+\\.)+[A-Za-z]+")</emphasis>
    public String getEmail() {}

    public void setEmail(String email) {}</programlisting>

        <para>When applying a RegEx expression to a value parameter within an
        action method, the annotation should precede that parameter:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">    public void newContact(
        @Named("Contact Name")
        String contactName,
        @Named("Email")
        <emphasis role="strong">@RegEx(validation = "(\\w+\\.)*\\w+@(\\w+\\.)+[A-Za-z]+")</emphasis>
        String email) {}</programlisting>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>@TypeOf</title>

        <para>The <literal moreinfo="none">@TypeOf</literal> annotation is
        used to specify the type of elements in a collection, when it is not
        possible to use generics - for example when invoking an external
        method that does not use generics.</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific"><emphasis role="strong">@TypeOf(Customer.class)</emphasis>
public List allNewCustomers() {
    return CustomerDatabase.allNewCustomers();
}</programlisting>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>@TypicalLength</title>

        <para>The <literal moreinfo="none">@TypicalLength</literal> annotation
        indicates the typical length of a <literal moreinfo="none">String</literal> property or <literal moreinfo="none">String</literal> parameter in an action. This may be
        used by the viewing mechanism to determine the space that should be
        given to that property or parameter in the appropriate view. For
        example:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">public class Customer {
    @MaxLength(30)
    <emphasis role="strong">@TypicalLength(20)</emphasis>
    public String getFirstName() { ... }
    public void setFirstName(String firstName) { ... }
}</programlisting>

        <para>If the typical length is the same as the <literal moreinfo="none">&lt;MaxLength&gt;</literal> then there is no need to
        specify <literal moreinfo="none">&lt;TypicalLength&gt;</literal> as
        well. If the value specified is zero or negative then it will be
        ignored.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>@Value</title>

        <para>The <literal moreinfo="none">@Value</literal> annotation
        indicates that a class should be treated as a value type rather than
        as a reference (or entity) type. It does this providing an
        implementation of a
        <literal>org.apache.isis.applib.adapters.ValueSemanticsProvider</literal>.</para>

        <para>For example:</para>

        <programlisting format="linespecific">@Value(semanticsProviderClass=ComplexNumberValueSemanticsProvider.class)
public class ComplexNumber {
    ...
}</programlisting>

        <para>The <literal>ValueSemanticsProvider</literal> allows the
        framework to interact with the value, parsing strings and displaying
        as text, and encoding/decoding (for serialization).</para>

      <para>This identity method is currently used only by perspectives, when

      uninitialised via its <literal>isInitialized</literal> method. For

      <para>A bootstrapper takes care of loading up the [[NAME]]
      framework and application, initialising it, and running it. When it
      starts up it reads in a list of components and attempts to load in each
      one. Any component that can be loaded is then available to be used and
      can then be specified on the command line if required. Requesting a
      component that cannot be loaded will result in an error. To resolve such
      an error simply ensure that the component's Jar file is available on the
      class path. All the components supplied with the framework are listed in
      the file <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">installer-registry.properties</filename> which is part
      of the <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">runtime-4.0.jar</filename> file.</para>

      <para>During start-up [[NAME]] loads in a number of configuration
      files. The main file, <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">isis.properties</filename>, is always loaded and
      must be present for the framework to start up. For each of the various
      types of persistor and viewer, there is a separate configuration file.
      For example, for the following command line parameters</para>

      <literallayout>-v dnd -r xml</literallayout>

      <para>specifies that the viewer is to be the drag and drop (<literal moreinfo="none">dnd</literal>) interface, and the persistor is to be the

      will look for configuration files named
      <filename moreinfo="none">viewer.properties</filename>, <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">viewer_dnd.properties</filename>,
      <filename moreinfo="none">persistor.xml</filename> and <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">persistor_xml.properties</filename> and will load them

          <para>The framework is started up in one of several different
          deployment modes, as listed below:</para>

          <para><emphasis>exploration</emphasis> - Exploration mode is for
          developers to explore and test their code. The framework always uses
          an in-memory persistor and runs the fixtures at startup to ensure a
          known state every time the system is started. The user is not
          prompted to log in, but is automatically logged in as user
          'exploration'. The logged in user can be changed on the fly using an
          option with the user interface; this simply changes the user and
          does not require an explicit login action. Also, exploration methods
          defined in the DOM are also available to the user to do things that
          a user would not normally be allowed to do. These are used expressly
          for testing the system. Please note it is an error to specify a
          persistor type in exploration mode.</para>

          <para><emphasis>prototype</emphasis> - Prototype mode is for
          demonstrating the system in realistic fashion. The user is always
          prompted to log in at start up, and can log out and log in again
          without losing the state of the objects. This allows a user to
          demonstrate exactly how a system would work.</para>

          <para><emphasis>single-user</emphasis> - Single user mode runs the
          system for a single user with object persistence.</para>

          <para><emphasis>client</emphasis> - Client mode provides multiple
          users access to a server. With this mode selected the
          <emphasis>connection</emphasis> option must also be
          specified.</para>

          <para><emphasis>server-exploration</emphasis> - Server mode, but all

      <para>The names of the images can be overriden by the reflector, which
      can pass back a name of an image that is found from the domain object.
      This provides a mechanism for objects to be shown with images that they
      themselves specify.</para>

      <para><emphasis>Extensions</emphasis> that are currently supported are

      <para><emphasis>ClassName</emphasis> is either the short form or the
      fully qualified name of the class, and case can be important depending
      on the platform.</para>

      <para>When loading images based on class, if no image is found for the
      current class using the above variations then the process is repeated

              <para>We provide the framework in a number of ways depending on
              how you want to work with it. The <emphasis>source</emphasis> is
              the most basic and requires the most work before the framwork
              can be used. This distribution allows you to regenerate the
              distributions, but does require Maven. The source distribution
              is simply an alternative to checking the code out from the
              Subversion repository. The <emphasis>for-maven</emphasis> and
              <emphasis>for-ant</emphasis> distributions provide all the
              required files to develop and run applications using the Maven
              and Ant build tools. The maven distribution is relatively small
              download as framework libraries are downloaded by Maven only
              when you actually build an application. An alternative to
              complete package is the
              <emphasis>libs-only-with-dependencies</emphasis>, which simply
              provides all the classes for the framework and dependent
              libraries in a single jar file that can be added straight to the

        <para>The configuration file (<filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">isis.properties</filename>) needs to specify
        what resources are used by the application and what fixtures to load.
        These details are common to all the modes that the NOF can be run in.
        Additional properties can be also specified for use in specific modes,
        such as database connection details when using the SQL object
        store.</para>

        <para>The configuration file <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">isis.properties</filename> is always picked
        up. In addition other properties files will be picked up, if present,
        based on the type, viewer, persistor and connection command line
        switches with the filename matching the option. E.g.</para>

        <para>-r (or --persistor) hibernate will cause
        <filename moreinfo="none">persistor.properties</filename> and <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">persistor_hibernate.properties</filename> to be
        used</para>

        <para>-t (or --type) client will cause <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">client.properties</filename> to be used</para>

        <para>-v (or --viewer) dnd will cause
        <filename moreinfo="none">viewer.properties</filename> and <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">viewer_dnd.properties</filename> to be used</para>

        <para>-x (or -- connector) xstream-sockets will cause
        <filename moreinfo="none">transport.properties</filename>,
        <filename moreinfo="none">transport_sockets.properties</filename>,
        <filename moreinfo="none">protocol.properties</filename> and
        <filename moreinfo="none">protocol_xstream.properties</filename> to be loaded; because
        of the way that connector is implemented it will also load
        <literal>persistor.properties</literal> and <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">persistor_xstream-sockets.properties</filename>
        too.</para>

        <para>In addition a particular file can be selected with the -c
