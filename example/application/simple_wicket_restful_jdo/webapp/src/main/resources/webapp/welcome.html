<p class="intro">
    <a href="http://isis.apache.org">Apache Isis</a>&trade; is a framework to let you rapidly develop 
    domain-driven apps in Java.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This app has been generated using Isis' 
    <a href="http://isis.apache.org/getting-started/simple-archetype.html">simple</a> archetype, 
    which configures Isis' most commonly used components as part of a very simple and purposefully minimal application.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The app itself consists of a single domain class, <a href="https://github.com/apache/isis/blob/master/example/application/simple%5Fwicket_restful_jdo/dom/src/main/java/dom/simple/SimpleObject.java"  target="_blank">SimpleObject</a>, 
    along with an equally simple (factory/repository) domain service, <a href="https://github.com/apache/isis/blob/master/example/application/simple%5Fwicket_restful_jdo/dom/src/main/java/dom/simple/SimpleObjects.java"  target="_blank">SimpleObjects</a>.
    <br/>
