# The values correspond to the named components in the installer-registry.properties file
# in the org.apache.isis.runtimes.dflt:runtime JAR (in the org.apache.isis.runtimes.dflt.runtime package)
#
# Although all configuration could reside in isis.properties, the recommendation is
# to split out into component specific files:
# 
#    xxx_yyy.properties files
#
# where
#    * xxx is the component type, and
#    * yyy is the component name.
#
# For example, persistor_sql.properties holds configuration information specific to the
#
#
# If the components are changed, also remember to edit pom.xml (further comments can be 
# found in the persistor_xxx.properties files)

#
# configure the persistor (object store) to use
#
# * in-memory   requires no additional configuration, but stores object in-memory.
#               Only suitable for prototyping
# * datanucleus uses JDO DataNucleus to persist objects to relational database.
#               for objectstore-specific properties, see persistor_datanucleus.properties   
# * fileserver  uses a simple FileServer to persist objects as JSON documents.  It requires the fileserver component to be running
#               for objectstore-specific properties, see persistor_fileserver.properties 
# * mongodb     uses MongoDB to be persist objects as JSON documents.  It requires MongoDB to be installed and running
#               for objectstore-specific properties, see persistor_fileserver.properties  
# * sql         uses an RDBMS to persist objects as table rows.  
#               for objectstore-specific properties, see persistor_sql.properties
# * xml         uses the XML ObjectStore to be persist objects to a set of XML files.  Only suitable for prototyping.
#               for objectstore-specific properties, see persistor_xml.properties 
#
# NOTE:
# * if using non-naive implementations of services, edit isis.services (below) and 
# * if necessary, update the pom.xml to reference appropriate objstore-xxx module
# * for sql and datanucleus objectstores, update the pom.xml to reference appropriate JDBC driver

# Specify the domain services.
# 
# These are the most important configuration properties in the system, as they define
# the set of the classes for Isis to instantiate as domain service singletons.
# From these domain service instances the rest of the metamodel is discovered, while the 
# end-user gains access to other domain objects by invoking the actions of the domain services.
#
# The implementations depend on the configured (see isis.persistor above) 
#


# if using the in-memory, XML, SQL, fileserver or mongo object stores:
#isis.services.prefix = dom
#isis.services = todo.ToDoItems


# if using the DataNucleus object store

#
# Specify the (optional) test fixtures
#
# Fixtures are used to seed the object store with an initial set of data.  For the 
# in-memory object store, the fixtures are installed on every run.  For other
# object stores, they are used only when the object store is first initialized.
