${symbol_pound} default is for wicket tags to be stripped in production (Isis SERVER mode == Wicket deployment mode), 
${symbol_pound} not stripped otherwise (Isis' PROTOTYPE mode == Wicket's DEVELOPMENT mode)

${symbol_pound}
${symbol_pound} if user attempts to access a protected URL before signing in, then as a convenience the viewer will continue
${symbol_pound} through to that destination after successful login.  If you consider this to be a security risk then this flag
${symbol_pound} disables that behaviour.
