${symbol_pound}
${symbol_pound} configuration file for the Wicket viewer
${symbol_pound}

${symbol_pound}
${symbol_pound} The maximum length of titles to display in standalone or parented tables.
${symbol_pound} Titles longer than this length will be truncated with trailing ellipses (...)
${symbol_pound}
${symbol_pound} For example, if set to 12, the title
${symbol_pound} "Buy milk on 15-Feb-13" will be truncated to "Buy milk ..."
${symbol_pound}
${symbol_pound} If set to 0, then only the icon will be shown.
${symbol_pound}
isis.viewer.wicket.maxTitleLengthInStandaloneTables=0
isis.viewer.wicket.maxTitleLengthInParentedTables=0


${symbol_pound}
${symbol_pound} in Firefox and more recent versions of Chrome 54+, cannot copy out of disabled fields; instead we use the
${symbol_pound} readonly attribute (https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-html5-20141028/forms.html${symbol_pound}the-readonly-attribute)
${symbol_pound} This behaviour is enabled by default but can be disabled using this flag
${symbol_pound}
${symbol_pound}isis.viewer.wicket.replaceDisabledTagWithReadonlyTag=true


${symbol_pound}
${symbol_pound} Whether to disable buttons after it has been clicked (for both form submit and no-arg actions), to prevent users
${symbol_pound} causing an error if they do a double click.
${symbol_pound} Also, whether to show an indicator alongside the button.
${symbol_pound}
${symbol_pound} This behaviour is enabled by default, but can be disabled using this flag.
${symbol_pound}
${symbol_pound}isis.viewer.wicket.preventDoubleClickForFormSubmit=true
${symbol_pound}isis.viewer.wicket.preventDoubleClickForNoArgAction=true
${symbol_pound}isis.viewer.wicket.useIndicatorForFormSubmit=true
${symbol_pound}isis.viewer.wicket.useIndicatorForNoArgAction=true


${symbol_pound}isis.viewer.wicket.datePicker.minDate=1900-01-01T00:00:00.000Z
${symbol_pound}isis.viewer.wicket.datePicker.maxDate=2100-01-01T00:00:00.000Z

${symbol_pound}isis.viewer.wicket.datePattern=dd-MM-yyyy
${symbol_pound}isis.viewer.wicket.dateTimePattern=dd-MM-yyyy HH:mm

${symbol_pound}isis.viewer.wicket.datePattern=dd/MM/yy
${symbol_pound}isis.viewer.wicket.dateTimePattern=dd/MM/yy HH:mm


${symbol_pound}
${symbol_pound} whether to strip wicket tags from markup (default is true, as they may break some CSS rules)
${symbol_pound}
${symbol_pound}isis.viewer.wicket.stripWicketTags=false


${symbol_pound}
${symbol_pound} action prompt='dialog' style ('sidebar' or 'modal', default is 'sidebar')
${symbol_pound}
${symbol_pound}isis.viewer.wicket.dialogMode=modal


${symbol_pound}
${symbol_pound} whether to suppress the 'rememberMe' checkbox on the login page (default is false)
${symbol_pound}
${symbol_pound}isis.viewer.wicket.rememberMe.suppress=false


${symbol_pound}
${symbol_pound} Encryption key is used to encrypt the rememberMe user/password.  It should be set to a unique and private value.
${symbol_pound} If a hard-coded and publicly known value is used, then it would be possible for rememberMe user/password to be
${symbol_pound} intercepted and decrypted, compromising access.
${symbol_pound}
${symbol_pound} If no value is set then (for safety) a random UUID will be used as the encryption key.  The net effect of this
${symbol_pound} default is that 'rememberMe' will work, but only until the webapp is restarted (after which the end-user will
${symbol_pound} have to log in again).
${symbol_pound}
${symbol_pound}isis.viewer.wicket.rememberMe.encryptionKey=myEncryptionKey


${symbol_pound}
${symbol_pound} if user attempts to access a protected URL before signing in, then as a convenience the viewer will continue
${symbol_pound} through to that destination after successful login.  If you consider this to be a security risk then this flag
${symbol_pound} disables that behaviour (default is false).
${symbol_pound}
${symbol_pound}isis.viewer.wicket.clearOriginalDestination=true


${symbol_pound}
${symbol_pound} whether to show the Wicket debug bar and any other development utilities
${symbol_pound} (default depends on whether running in prototype mode or not; this property overrides that)
${symbol_pound}
${symbol_pound}isis.viewer.wicket.developmentUtilities.enable=true
isis.viewer.wicket.developmentUtilities.enable=true



${symbol_pound}
${symbol_pound} whether to show bookmarks (defaults to true)
${symbol_pound}
${symbol_pound}isis.viewer.wicket.bookmarkedPages.showChooser=true



${symbol_pound}
${symbol_pound} the maximum number of pages to list in bookmark (default is 15)
${symbol_pound}
${symbol_pound}isis.viewer.wicket.bookmarkedPages.maxSize=15


${symbol_pound}
${symbol_pound} whether to show breadcrumbs (defaults to true)
${symbol_pound}
${symbol_pound}isis.viewer.wicket.breadcrumbs.showChooser=true





${symbol_pound}
${symbol_pound} whether to show the bootstrap theme chooser (defaults false)
${symbol_pound}
${symbol_pound}isis.viewer.wicket.themes.showChooser=false
isis.viewer.wicket.themes.showChooser=true


${symbol_pound}
${symbol_pound} comma-separated list of themes to choose from (default is to show all themes from bootswatch.com).
${symbol_pound}
${symbol_pound}isis.viewer.wicket.themes.enabled=bootstrap-theme,Cosmo,Flatly,Darkly,Sandstone,United

${symbol_pound} ISIS-1520 Temporarily disable the broken Amelia theme and list all other themes
isis.viewer.wicket.themes.enabled=bootstrap-theme, Cerulean, Cosmo, Cyborg, Darkly, Flatly, Journal, Lumen, Paper, Readable, Sandstone, Simplex, Slate, Spacelab, Superhero, United, Yeti

${symbol_pound}
${symbol_pound} whether to automatically select dependent choice when the choice it depends upon changes.
${symbol_pound}
${symbol_pound}isis.viewer.wicket.disableDependentChoiceAutoSelection=false


${symbol_pound}
${symbol_pound} enable liveReload.  For example, use with gradle -t -b liveReload.gradle --offline &
${symbol_pound}
${symbol_pound}isis.viewer.wicket.liveReloadUrl=http://localhost:35729/livereload.js?snipver=1



${symbol_pound}
${symbol_pound} cookie key holding the (encrypted) 'rememberMe' user/password.
${symbol_pound} If not specified then the cookie key 'isisWicketRememberMe' will be used; there is generally no need to change this.
${symbol_pound}
${symbol_pound}isis.viewer.wicket.rememberMe.cookieKey=isisWicketRememberMe


${symbol_pound}
${symbol_pound} specifies whether an INLINE or DIALOG prompt should be used for property edits and for action invocations (of actions
${symbol_pound} associated with a property).  This is a fallback where not specified on a case-by-case using @PropertyLayout or
${symbol_pound} @ActionLayout (or equivalents in the Xxx.layout.xml file).
${symbol_pound}
${symbol_pound} If not specified then the default is an inline prompt.
${symbol_pound}
${symbol_pound}isis.viewer.wicket.promptStyle=INLINE


${symbol_pound}
${symbol_pound} If set then reverts to pre-1.15.0 behaviour of redirecting to a new page on any action invocation or property edit.
${symbol_pound} If left to its default then the page will be updated if the same object is rendered, making for a smoother user
${symbol_pound} experience.
${symbol_pound}
${symbol_pound}isis.viewer.wicket.redirectEvenIfSameObject=false
