${symbol_pound} specify system components.
${symbol_pound}
${symbol_pound} The values correspond to the named components in the installer-registry.properties file
${symbol_pound} in the org.apache.isis.runtimes.dflt:runtime JAR (in the org.apache.isis.runtimes.dflt.runtime package)
${symbol_pound}
${symbol_pound} Although all configuration could reside in isis.properties, the recommendation is
${symbol_pound} to split out into component specific files:
${symbol_pound} 
${symbol_pound}    xxx_yyy.properties files
${symbol_pound}
${symbol_pound} where
${symbol_pound}    * xxx is the component type, and
${symbol_pound}    * yyy is the component name.
${symbol_pound}
${symbol_pound} For example, persistor_sql.properties holds configuration information specific to the
${symbol_pound}
${symbol_pound}
${symbol_pound} If the components are changed, also remember to edit pom.xml (further comments can be 
${symbol_pound} found in the persistor_xxx.properties files)

${symbol_pound}
${symbol_pound} configure authentication mechanism to use (to logon to the system)
${symbol_pound} note:
${symbol_pound} - authentication is disabled if running in exploration mode
${symbol_pound} - the Scimpi viewer allows access to anonymous users
${symbol_pound} 
 
${symbol_pound} default is file in SERVER mode, none in SERVER_EXPLORATION.  Derived from wicket mode 
${symbol_pound}isis.authentication=bypass

${symbol_pound}
${symbol_pound} configure authorization mechanism to use
${symbol_pound}
${symbol_pound} The authorization mechanism define each users' permissions to view/edit object properties 
${symbol_pound} or collections, and to view/invoke object actions
${symbol_pound}
${symbol_pound} configuring this component automatically refines the metamodel (installing a facet factory
${symbol_pound} which vetoes access as required)

${symbol_pound}
${symbol_pound} configure the user profile store to use.
${symbol_pound} 
${symbol_pound} the user profile store is supported by some viewers (though not the Wicket or 
${symbol_pound} Restful viewers) as a way to store user-specific settings  (eg colours, themes etc)
