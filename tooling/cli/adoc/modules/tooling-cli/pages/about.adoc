Command Line Interface for the _Apache Isis Tooling_ ecosystem, to generate documentation from program sources (`.java` files, `pom.xml`, etc).



== Prerequisites

From the root of the git repo, build the tooling using Java 11:

[source,java]
----
mvn install -D module-tooling -Dskip.essential
----

This will generate the command line CLI as an executable jar in its target directory (`tooling/cli/target`).


== Available Commands

Use the help command to see a list of available commands:

[source]
.calling for help
----
java -jar tooling/cli/target/isis-tooling-cli.jar --help
----

which (currently) generates the following:

[source]
----
Usage: cli [-hV] [-o=<outputPath>] [-p=<projectRootPath>] [COMMAND]
CLI for the Apache Isis Tooling Ecosystem
  -h, --help      Show this help message and exit.
  -o, --output=<outputPath>
                  path to the output file (default: NONE = write to std.out)
  -p, --project=<projectRootPath>
                  path to the (multi-module) project root (default: current dir)
  -V, --version   Print version information and exit.
Commands:
  overview  Writes a System Overview document (AsciiDoc) to given output.
  index     Writes a Global Index (AsciiDoc) to given output.
----

By default, the current directory is used as the target to perform commands in.


=== Configuration File

The `isis-tooling.yml` configuration file (found in the root of the repo) provides default options for each command, as well as global defaults applicable to all commands:

[source,yml]
.isis-tooling.yml
----
global: # <.>
  option ...
  option ...
command:
  overview: # <.>
    ...
  index:    # <.>
    ...
----

<.> configuration applicable to all commands
<.> configuration for the "overview" command
<.> configuration for the "index" command

TIP: This configuration file is mapped onto the `CLIConfig` bean.
Inspect its https://github.com/apache/isis/blob/master/tooling/cli/src/main/java/org/apache/isis/tooling/cli/CliConfig.java#L31[source code] for more detailed information.


== Commands

There is currently only one subcommand, namely "projdoc".

=== projdoc

Generates the _System Overview_ and the _Document Global Index_ (adoc) files.

The `projdoc` command is usually invoked as follows:

[source]
.Example Usage
----
java -jar tooling/cli/target/isis-tooling-cli.jar \
    -p . \
    projdoc \
    -o antora/components/system/modules/generated
----

where :

* `-p` indicates the location of the multi-project root `pom.xml`
+
in other words, the root of the git repo.

* `projdoc` is CLI sub-command
+
selecting the _Project Doc Generator_ functionality

* `-o` the output target root for generated _adoc_


Any class found with magic `{@index}` in its _java-doc_ section at type level, will be included with the _Document Global Index_.
Adoc files may refer to the _Document Global Index_ via `xref` or `include` statements using paths like eg. `system:generated:index/applib/Xxx.adoc`.


==== Configuration

The `projdoc` command can be configured using the `projectDoc` entry in `isis-tooling.yml` file.

[source,yml]
.isis-tooling.yml
----
projectDoc:
  description: "These tables summarize all Maven artifacts ..."           # <.>
  licenseHeader: "Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) ..."   # <.>
  outputRootFolder:                                                       # <.>
  documentPagesPath: "pages"                                              # <.>
  documentGlobalIndexPath: "pages/index"                                  # <.>
  documentGlobalIndexXrefPageIdFormat: "system:generated:index/%s.adoc"   # <.>
  systemOverviewFilename: "system-overview.adoc"                          # <.>
  fixOrphanedAdocIncludeStatements: true                                  # <.>
  namespacePartsSkipCount: 3                                              # <.>
  artifactGroups:                                                         # <.>
    Base: org.apache.isis
    Commons: org.apache.isis.commons.*
    Core: org.apache.isis.core.*
    App: org.apache.isis.app.*
    ...
----

<.> _System Overview_ head line
<.> license header to include with each generated _adoc_ file
<.> the output target root for generated _adoc_; corresponds to command line option `-o` (if empty the current dir is used)
<.> sub-folder name for _adoc_ pages
<.> sub-folder name for the _Document Global Index_
<.> format for include statements via which other _adoc_ files may refer to _the Document Global Index_
<.> name of the _System Overview_ (adoc) file
<.> whether to activate the `OrphanedIncludeStatementFixer`
<.> how many namespace parts in a _fqn_ one wants to skip when generating the _Document Global Index_, eg. in `org.apache.isis.applib.Xxx` if we skip 3 namespace parts we'll end up with `applib.Xxx`
<.> logical grouping of artifacts for the system overview, if not specified the natural Maven project hierarchy is reflected as is

The CLI also has an experimental `OrphanedIncludeStatementFixer` that checks orphaned index references in all _adoc_ files and tries to fix them.

==== Limitations

There are currently a couple of limitations:

* the _Document Global Index_ can only contain classes unique by their simple name, otherwise the `OrphanedIncludeStatementFixer` would not be able to reason about how to fix orphaned references.

* the `OrphanedIncludeStatementFixer` also can fix up references to classes that have been moved, but it cannot fix up orphans where the class has been renamed.
