The starter app parent POM is provided as a convenience to act as the `<parent>` for Apache Isis applications.
It builds upon a similar POM provided by the Spring Boot framework, which ensures a consistent set of dependencies, as well as configuring various build plugins.

== Usage

To use it, just add:

[source,xml]
.pom.xml
----
<parent>
    <groupId>org.apache.isis.app</groupId>
    <artifactId>isis-app-starter-parent</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.0</version>                            <!--1-->
</parent>
----
<1> update as required for new versions of the framework.

You'll see that it is used by both the xref:docs:starters:helloworld.adoc[HelloWorld] and xref:docs:starters:simpleapp.adoc[SimpleApp] starter apps.

== Relationship to other POMs

The diagram below (link:{attachmentsdir}/parent-pom.pptx[PPT]) below shows how the parent POM relates to other POMs:

As the diagram shows, the parent POM inherits two Spring Boot parent POMs: directly from `org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-parent`, and transitively inherits from `org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-dependencies`.

* `spring-boot-starter-parent` configures various `<build>/<plugins>` and `<resources>`, while
* `spring-boot-dependencies` the second defines numerous `xxx.version` properties for various third party applications (validated as being compatible with each other by the Spring Boot team), and sets up corresponding `<dependencyManagement>/<dependencies>`.

The parent POM also import (using `scope=import, type=pom`) each of the "bill of material" POMs provided by Apache Isis framework:

* `org.apache.isis.core:isis` -
+
The two core modules most commonly referenced by domain applications are `o.a.i.core:isis-applib` and `o.a.i.core:isis-schema`.

* `o.a.i.testing:isis-testing`
+
For the `isis-testing-xxx` modules (fixture scripts, unit test support, integ test support etc)

* `o.a.i.extensions:isis-extensions`

* `o.a.i.subdomains:isis-subdomains`

* `o.a.i.mappings:isis-mappings`

* `o.a.i.valuetypes:isis-valuetypes`

* `o.a.i.incubator:isis-incubator`

* `o.a.i.legacy:isis-legacy`

These all set up `<dependencyManagement>/<dependencies>` entries for all of the modules, meaning that there's only one place to update the version to Apache Isis (the reference to the parent POM).
