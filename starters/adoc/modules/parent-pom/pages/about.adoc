The starter app parent POM is provided as a convenience to act as the `<parent>` for Apache Causeway applications.
It builds upon a similar POM provided by the Spring Boot framework, which ensures a consistent set of dependencies, as well as configuring various build plugins.

== Usage

To use it, just add:

[source,xml,subs="attributes+"]
.pom.xml
----
<parent>
    <groupId>org.apache.causeway.app</groupId>
    <artifactId>causeway-app-starter-parent</artifactId>
    <version>{page-causewayreleaseversion}</version>                    <!--.-->
</parent>
----
<.> update as required for new versions of the framework.

You'll see that it is used by both the xref:docs:starters:helloworld.adoc[HelloWorld] and xref:docs:starters:simpleapp.adoc[SimpleApp] starter apps.

== Relationship to other POMs

The diagram below shows how the starter POM (on the right hand side) relates to other POMs:

image::pom-hierarchy.drawio.png[]


As the diagram shows, the parent POM inherits two Spring Boot parent POMs: directly from `org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-parent`, and transitively inherits from `org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-dependencies`.

* `spring-boot-starter-parent` configures various `<build>/<plugins>` and `<resources>`, while
* `spring-boot-dependencies` the second defines numerous `xxx.version` properties for various third party applications (validated as being compatible with each other by the Spring Boot team), and sets up corresponding `<dependencyManagement>/<dependencies>`.

The parent POM also import (using `scope=import, type=pom`) each of the "bill of material" POMs provided by Apache Causeway framework:

* `org.apache.causeway.core:causeway` -
+
The two core modules most commonly referenced by domain applications are `o.a.c.core:causeway-applib` and `o.a.c.core:causeway-schema`.

* `o.a.c.testing:causeway-testing`
+
For the `causeway-testing-xxx` modules (fixture scripts, unit test support, integ test support etc)

* `o.a.c.extensions:causeway-extensions`

* `o.a.c.subdomains:causeway-subdomains`

* `o.a.c.valuetypes:causeway-valuetypes`

* `o.a.c.incubator:causeway-incubator`

* `o.a.c.legacy:causeway-legacy`

These all set up `<dependencyManagement>/<dependencies>` entries for all of the modules, meaning that there's only one place to update the version to Apache Causeway (the reference to the parent POM).


[#surefire-configuration]
== Surefire Configuration

:asterisk: *

The parent pom configures the Maven surefire plugin to execute multiple times, based on test class name.
These must match

* *`{asterisk}Test{asterisk}.java`* (unit tests)
+
Test classes named "{asterisk}Testing.java", "{asterisk}IntegTest{asterisk}.java" and "{asterisk}Abstract{asterisk}.java" are all excluded.

* *`{asterisk}IntegTest{asterisk}.java`* (integration tests)
+
Test classes named "{asterisk}Abstract{asterisk}.java" are excluded.

* *`{asterisk}Spec{asterisk}.java`* (Cucumber BDD specs)
+
Test classes named "{asterisk}Test.java", "{asterisk}Testing.java", "{asterisk}IntegTest{asterisk}.java" and "{asterisk}Abstract{asterisk}.java" are all excluded.
