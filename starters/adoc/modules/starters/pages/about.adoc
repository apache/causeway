To get started with a new application, download one of the two starter apps.


== HelloWorld

The helloworld app is a very minimal app, intended just as a starting point to learn what the framework is all about.

The source code is in this link:https://github.com/apache/causeway-app-helloworld[git repo] which you can either fork, or just download as a zip:

* to use JPA as the ORM, use:
+
include::helloworld-script-jpa.adoc[]

* use JDO as the ORM, use:
+
include::helloworld-script-jdo.adoc[]


TIP: A much more complete explanation of the structure of the app (and how to use it) can be found *xref:docs:starters:helloworld.adoc[here]*.


== Simple App

This app has the same functionality as _HelloWorld_, but is structured so it can be used as a starting point for developing your own applications.
It also includes some xref:testing:integtestsupport:about.adoc[integration tests], xref:testing:fixtures:about.adoc[fixtures], and xref:testing:specsupport:about.adoc[BDD (Cucumber)] specs.

The source code can be found in this link:https://github.com/apache/causeway-app-simpleapp[git repo] which you can either fork, or just download as a zip:

* to use JPA for the ORM, use:
+
include::simpleapp-script-jpa.adoc[]

* to use JDO as the ORM, use:
+
include::simpleapp-script-jdo.adoc[]



TIP: A much more complete explanation of the structure of the app (and how to use it) can be found *xref:docs:starters:simpleapp.adoc[here]*.


== Updating to Newer Versions

For both apps you can bump to newer versions of the framework just by updating the `<version>` of the xref:docs:parent-pom:about.adoc[Parent POM]:

[source,xml,subs="attributes+"]
