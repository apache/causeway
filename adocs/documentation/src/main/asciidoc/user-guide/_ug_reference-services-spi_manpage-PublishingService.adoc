The `PublishingService` is intended for coarse-grained publish/subscribe for system-to-system interactions, from Isis to some other system.  Here the only events published are those that action invocations and of changed objects.  A typical use case is to publish onto a pub/sub bus such as link:http://activemq.apache.org/[ActiveMQ] with link:http://camel.apache.org[Camel] to keep other systems up to date.



== SPI

The SPI defined by the service is:

[source,java]
----
public interface PublishingService {
    public void publish(
        EventMetadata metadata,                                 // <1>
        EventPayload payload);                                  // <2>
    @Deprecated
    @Programmatic
    void setEventSerializer(EventSerializer eventSerializer);   // <3>
}
----
<1> standard metadata about the event, such as the user, the xref:_ug_reference-classes_mixins_manpage-HasTransactionId[`transactionId`], date/time etc
<2> for published actions, an `EventPayloadForActionInvocation` (or subclass thereof); for published objects, an `EventPayloadForObjectChanged` (or subclass thereof)
<3> injects in the xref:_ug_reference-services-spi_manpage-EventSerializer[`EventSerializer`] service.  This is deprecated because not every implementation is required to use an `EventSerializer` so its inclusion within the SPI of `PublishingService` was in retrospect a mistake.


Typically implementations will use the injected `EventSerializer` to convert the metadata and payload into a form to be published:

[source,java]
----
public interface EventSerializer {
    public Object serialize(EventMetadata metadata, EventPayload payload);
}
----

The serialized form returned by `EventSerializer` must be in a form that the `PublishingService` implementation is able to handle. Strings are a good lowest common denominator, but (if custom implementations of both `EventSerializer` and `PublishingService` were in use) then it might also be some other type, for example an `org.w3c.dom.Document` or an `org.json.JSONObject` might be returned instead.



== Implementation

The (non-ASF) http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-publishing[Isis addons' publishing] module provides an implementation (`org.isisaddons.module.publishing.dom.org.apache.isis.applib.services.publish`) that persists each event as a `PublishedEvent` entity.  This holds the serialized form of the event metadata and payload as translated into a string by the injected `EventSerializer`.  The module also provides its own implementation of `EventSerializer`, namely `RestfulObjectsSpecEventSerializer`, which represents the event payload using the representation defined by the link:http://restfulobjects.org[Restful Objects spec] of (transient) objects, grafting on the metadata as additional JSON nodes.

The `PublishedEvent` entity also has a `state` field taking the values either "QUEUED" or "PROCESSED".  The intention here is that an event bus can poll this table to grab pending events and dispatch them to downstream systems.  When ``PublishedEvent``s are persisted initially they always take the value "QUEUED".




== Usage

To indicate that an action invocation should be published, annotate it with the xref:_ug_reference-annotations_manpage-Action_publishing[`@Action#publishing()`] annotation.

To indicate that a changed object should be published is to annotate it with the xref:_ug_reference-annotations_manpage-DomainObject_publishing[`@DomainObject#publishing()`] annotation.


It is also possible to "fine-tune" the `EventPayload` using the `#publishingFactory()` attribute (for both annotations).  By default the `EventPayload` that is serialized identifies the object(s) being interacted with or changed, and in the case of the action invocation provides details of the action arguments and result (if any) of that action.  However, the payload does not (by default) include any information about the new state of these objects. It is therefore the responsibility of the subscriber to call back to Isis to determine any information that has not been published.

Although the representations (if using the Restful Object serializer and Restful Objects viewer) does include hrefs for the objects, this nevertheless requires an additional network call to obtain this information).

In some circumstances, then, it may make more sense to eagerly "push" information about the change to the subscriber by including that state within the payload.

To accomplish this, an implementation of a "`PayloadFactory`" must be specified in the annotation.

For actions, we implement the `PublishingPayloadFactoryForAction` (in `o.a.i.applib.annotation`):

[source,java]
----
public interface PublishingPayloadFactoryForAction {
    @Programmatic
    public EventPayload payloadFor(
            Identifier actionIdentifier,
            Object target,
            List<Object> arguments,
            Object result);
}
}
----
The `EventPayloadForActionInvocation` abstract class (in the Isis applib) should be used as the base class for the object instance returned from `payLoadFor(...)`.

For objects, the interface to implement is `PublishingPayloadFactoryForObject`:

[source,java]
----
public interface PublishingPayloadFactoryForObject {

    @Programmatic
    public EventPayload payloadFor(
        Object changedObject,
        PublishingChangeKind publishingChangeKind);     // <1>
}
----
<1> an enum taking the values `CREATE`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`

Similarly, the `EventPayloadForObjectChanged` abstract class should be used as the base class for the object returned from `payLoadFor(...)`.

For example, the following will eagerly include a `ToDoItem`'s `description` property whenever it is changed:

[source,java]
----
@DomainObject(publishingPayloadFactory=ToDoItemPayloadFactory.class)
public class ToDoItem {
    ...
}
----

where `ToDoItemPayloadFactory` is defined as:

[source,java]
----
public class ToDoItemChangedPayloadFactory implements PublishingPayloadFactoryForObject {
    public static class ToDoItemPayload
        extends EventPayloadForObjectChanged<ToDoItem> {
      public ToDoItemPayload(ToDoItem changed) { super(changed); }
      public String getDescription() { return getChanged().getDescription(); }
    }
    @Override
    public EventPayload payloadFor(Object changedObject, PublishingChangeKind kind) {
        return new ToDoItemPayload((ToDoItem) changedObject);
    }
}
----




== Registering the Services

Assuming that the `configuration-and-annotation` services installer is configured:

[source,ini]
----
isis.services-installer=configuration-and-annotation
----

then adding the (non-ASF) http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-publishing[Isis addons' publishing] module to the classpath will automatically register the `PublishingService` implementation (and also the module's `RestfulObjectsSpecEventSerializer` implementation).




== Related Services

The `PublishingService` is intended for coarse-grained publish/subscribe for system-to-system interactions, from Isis to some other system. Here the only events published are those that action invocations (for actions annotated with xref:_ug_reference-annotations_manpage-Action_publishing[`@Action#publishing()`]) and of changed objects (for objects annotated with xref:_ug_reference-annotations_manpage-DomainObject_publishing[`@DomainObject#publishing()`].

The xref:_ug_reference-services-api_manpage-EventBusService[`EventBusService`] meanwhile is intended for fine-grained publish/subscribe for object-to-object interactions within an Isis domain object model. The event propagation is strictly in-memory, and there are no restrictions on the object acting as the event (it need not be serializable, for example).

All three of these services collaborate implicitly by way of the xref:_ug_reference-classes_mixins_manpage-HasTransactionId[`HasTransactionId`] interface.
