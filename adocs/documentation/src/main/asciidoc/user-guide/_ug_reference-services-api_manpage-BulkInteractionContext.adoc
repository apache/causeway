Title: Bulk Interaction

The `Bulk.InteractionContext` domain service is a link:../../more-advanced-topics/how-to-09-020-How-to-write-a-typical-domain-service.html[request-scoped] service intended to support the implementation of link:../recognized-annotations/Bulk.html[@Bulk] actions. That is, when a bulk action is invoked over a collection of objects, each object instance "knows where it is" in the collection. In essence, the `Bulk.InteractionContext` service acts a little like an iterator.

=== API

The API defined by the service is:

[source]
----
@RequestScoped
public static class InteractionContext {

    public static enum InvokedAs { BULK, REGULAR }

    public InvokedAs getInvokedAs() { ... }

    public List<Object> getDomainObjects() { ... }
    public int getSize() { ... }
    public int getIndex() { ... }
    public boolean isFirst() { ... }
    public boolean isLast() { ... }
}
----

where:

* `getInvokedAs()` tells the domain object whether this particular action invocation is being performed as a
 bulk action (against each domain object in a list of domain objects) or merely as a regular action (against
 a single domain object).
* `getDomainObjects())` returns the list of domain objects which are being acted upon
* `getIndex()` is the 0-based index to the object being acted upon.

=== Usage

For bulk actions that are void or that return null, Isis will return to the list once executed. But for bulk
actions that are non-void, Isis will render the returned object/value from the last object invoked (and simply
discards the object/value of all actions except the last).

One idiom is for the domain objects to also use the link:./scratchpad.html[Scratchpad] service to share information,
for example to aggregate values. The `Bulk.InteractionContext#isLast()` method can then be used to determine if
all the information has been gathered, and then do something with it (eg derive variance across a range of values,
render a graph etc).

More prosaically, the `Bulk.InteractionContext` can be used to ensure that the bulk action behaves appropriately
depending on whether it is called in bulk mode or regular mode. Here's a snippet of code from the bulk action in
the Isis addon example https://github.com/isisaddons/isis-app-todoapp/[todoapp] (not ASF):

[source]
----
@Bulk
public ToDoItem completed() {
    setComplete(true);
    ...

    // if invoked as a regular action, return this object;
    // otherwise (if invoked as bulk), return null (so go back to the list)
    return bulkInteractionContext.getInvokedAs() == InvokedAs.REGULAR? this: null;
}
----

=== Registering the Service

The `Bulk.InteractionContext` class is automatically registered (it is annotated with `@DomainService`) so no further configuration is required.

=== Unit testing support

The `Bulk.InteractionContext` class also has a couple of static factory
methods intended to support unit testing:

[source]
----
public static InteractionContext regularAction(Object domainObject) {
    return new InteractionContext(InvokedAs.REGULAR, Collections.singletonList(domainObject));
}

public static InteractionContext bulkAction(Object... domainObjects) {
    return bulkAction(Arrays.asList(domainObjects));
}

public static InteractionContext bulkAction(List<Object> domainObjects) {
    return new InteractionContext(InvokedAs.BULK, domainObjects);
}
