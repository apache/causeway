IMPORTANT: WIP ... this section

The `@Hidden` annotation indicates that the member (property, collection or action) to which it is applied should never be visible to the user. It can also be applied to service types (it has no effect if applied to entities or values).

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {
    @Hidden
    public int getInternalId() { ... }

    @Hidden
    public void updateStatus() { ... }
    ...
}
----

Or, applied to a service:

[source,java]
----
@Hidden
public class EmailService {
    public void sendEmail(...) { ... }
    ...
}
----

This annotation can also take a parameters indicating where and when it
is to be hidden. For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {
    @Hidden(when=When.ONCE_PERSISTED)
    public int getInternalId() { ... }
    ...
}
----

would show the `Id` until the object has been saved, and then would hide
it. And:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {
    @Hidden(where=Where.ALL_TABLES)
    public int getDateOfBirth() { ... }
    ...
}
----

would suppress the `dateOfBirth` property of a Customer from all tables.

The acceptable values for the `where` parameter are:

* `Where.ANYWHERE` +
+
The member should be hidden everywhere.

* `Where.OBJECT_FORMS` +
+
The member should be hidden when displayed within an object form.
For most viewers, this applies to property and collection members,
not actions.

* `Where.PARENTED_TABLES` +
+
The member should be hidden when displayed as a column of a table
within a parent object's collection. For most (all?) viewers, this
will have meaning only if applied to a property member.

* `Where.STANDALONE_TABLES` +
+
The member should be hidden when displayed as a column of a table
showing a standalone list of objects, for example as returned by a
repository query. For most (all?) viewers, this will have meaning
only if applied to a property member.

* `Where.ALL_TABLES` +
+
The member should be /hidden when displayed as a column of a table,
either an object's * collection or a standalone list. This combines
`PARENTED_TABLES` and `STANDALONE_TABLES`.

* `Where.NOWHERE` +
+
Acts as an override if a member would normally be hidden as a result
of some other convention. For example, if a property is annotated
with `@Title` <!--(see ?)-->, then normally this should be hidden from all
tables. Additionally annotating with `@Hidden(where=Where.NOWHERE)`
overrides this.

The acceptable values for the `when` parameter are:

* `When.ALWAYS` +
+
The member should be hidden at all times.

* `When.NEVER` +
+
The member should never be hidden (unless disabled through some
other mechanism, for example an imperative disableXxx() supporting
method)..

* `When.ONCE_PERSISTED` +
+
The member should be visible for transient objects, but hidden for
persisted objects.

* `When.UNTIL_PERSISTED` +
+
The member should be hidden for transient objects, but visible for
persisted objects.

By default the annotated property or action is always hidden (ie
defaults to `Where.ANYWHERE`, `When.ALWAYS`).
