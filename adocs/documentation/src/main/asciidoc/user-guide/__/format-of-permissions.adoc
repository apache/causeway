Title: Format of Permissions

Shiro converts permission strings (as found in `WEB-INF/shiro.ini`) internally into `Permission` instances.

The default implementation converts these strings to `WildcardPermission` instances, which allows permissions to be organized hierarchical and with wildcarding. 

Shiro also allows the conversion to be mapped to alternative `Permission` instances; Isis provides its own `IsisPermission` which provides an extended and more flexible syntax.

== Using the Shiro Default Permission Syntax

The default syntax for permissions is:

[source]
----
packageName:ClassName:memberName:r,w
----

where:

* `memberName` is the property, collection or action name.
* `r` indicates that the member is visible
* `w` indicates that the member is usable (editable or invokable)

Because these are wildcards, a '*' can be used at any level. Additionally, missing levels assume wildcards.

Thus:

[source]
----
com.mycompany.myapp:Customer:firstName:r,w   # view or edit customer's firstName
com.mycompany.myapp:Customer:lastName:r      # view customer's lastName only
com.mycompany.myapp:Customer:placeOrder:*    # view and invoke placeOrder action
com.mycompany.myapp:Customer:placeOrder      # ditto
com.mycompany.myapp:Customer:*:r             # view all customer class members
com.mycompany.myapp:*:*:r                    # view-only access for all classes in myapp package
com.mycompany.myapp:*:*:*                    # view/edit for all classes in myapp package
com.mycompany.myapp:*:*                      # ditto
com.mycompany.myapp:*                        # ditto
com.mycompany.myapp                          # ditto
*                                            # view/edit access to everything
----

== Using the Enhanced Isis Permission Syntax

Isis defines its own extended syntax for permissions, following the format:

[source]
----
([!]?)([^/]+)[/](.+)
----

where:

* the optional `!` prefix indicates this permission is a vetoing permission
* the optional `xxx/` prefix is a permission group that scopes any vetoing permissions
* the remainder of the string is the permission (possibly wildcarded, with :rw as optional suffix)

For example:

[source]
----
user_role   = !reg/org.estatio.api,\
              !reg/org.estatio.webapp.services.admin,\
              reg/* ; \
api_role    = org.estatio.api ;\
admin_role = adm/*
----

sets up:
* the user role with access to all permissions except those in `org.estatio.api` and `org.estatio.webapp.services.admin`
* the api_role with access to all permissions in `org.estatio.api`
* the admin_role with access to everything.

The permission group concept is required to scope the applicability of any veto permission. This is probably best explained by an example. Suppose that a user has both `admin_role` and `user_role`; we would want the `admin_role` to trump the vetos of the `user_role`, in other words to give the user access to everything. Because of the permission groups, the two `!reg/...` vetos in user_role only veto out selected permissions granted by the `reg/*` permissions, but they do not veto the permissions granted by a different scope, namely `adm/*`. The net effect is what we would want: that a user with both `admin_role` and `user_role` would have access to everything, irrespective of those two veto permissions of the `user_role`.

To tell Shiro to use the Isis permission format, add the following to `shiro.ini`:

[source]
----
permissionResolver = org.apache.isis.security.shiro.authorization.IsisPermissionResolver
xxxRealm.permissionResolver = $permissionResolver
----

where `xxxRealm` is the realm to be configured.
