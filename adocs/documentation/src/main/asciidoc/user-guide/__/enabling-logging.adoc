Title: Enabling Logging

Sometimes you just need to see what is going on. There are various ways in which logging can be enabled, here are some ideas.

=== In Apache Isis

Modify `WEB-INF/logging.properties` (a log4j config file)

=== In DataNucleus

As per the http://www.datanucleus.org/products/accessplatform/logging.html[DN logging page]

=== In the JDBC Driver

Configure log4jdbc JDBC rather than the vanilla driver (see `WEB-INF/persistor_datanucleus.properties`) and configure log4j logging (see `WEB-INF/logging.properties`).

There are examples of both in the link:../../../intro/getting-started/simpleapp-archetype.html[simpleapp archetype].

=== In the Database

==== HSQLDB Logging

Add `;sqllog=3` to the end of the JDBC URL.

==== PostgreSQL Logging

In `postgresql\9.2\data\postgresql.conf`:

Will then log to `postgresql\9.2\data\pg_log` directory.

Note that you must restart the service for this to be picked up.

==== MS SQL Server Logging

Use the excellent SQL Profiler tool.
