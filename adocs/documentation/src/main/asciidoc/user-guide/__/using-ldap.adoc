Title: Using Shiro with an LDAP Server

Isis ships with an implementation of http://shiro.apache.org[Apache Shiro]'s `Realm` class that allows user authentication and authorization to be performed against an LDAP server.

The configuration required in the `WEB-INF/shiro.ini` file is:

[source]
----
contextFactory = org.apache.isis.security.shiro.IsisLdapContextFactory
contextFactory.url = ldap://localhost:10389
contextFactory.authenticationMechanism = CRAM-MD5
contextFactory.systemAuthenticationMechanism = simple
contextFactory.systemUsername = uid=admin,ou=system
contextFactory.systemPassword = secret

ldapRealm = org.apache.isis.security.shiro.IsisLdapRealm
ldapRealm.contextFactory = $contextFactory

ldapRealm.searchBase = ou=groups,o=mojo
ldapRealm.groupObjectClass = groupOfUniqueNames
ldapRealm.uniqueMemberAttribute = uniqueMember
ldapRealm.uniqueMemberAttributeValueTemplate = uid={0}

# optional mapping from physical groups to logical application roles
ldapRealm.rolesByGroup = \
    LDN_USERS: user_role,\
    NYK_USERS: user_role,\
    HKG_USERS: user_role,\
    GLOBAL_ADMIN: admin_role,\
    DEMOS: self-install_role

ldapRealm.permissionsByRole=\
   user_role = *:ToDoItemsJdo:*:*,\
               *:ToDoItem:*:*; \
   self-install_role = *:ToDoItemsFixturesService:install:* ; \
   admin_role = *

securityManager.realms = $ldapRealm
----

where:

* user accounts are searched under `ou=system`
* users have, at minimum, a `uid` attribute and a password
* SASL (CRAM-MD5) authentication is used for this authentication
* the users credentials are used to verify their user/password
* groups are searched under `ou=groups,o=mojo` (where `mojo` is the company name)
* each group has an LDAP objectClass of `groupOfUniqueNames`
* each group has a vector attribute of `uniqueMember`
* each value of `uniqueMember` is in the form `uid=xxx`, with `xxx` being the uid of the user
* the group membership is looked up using the specified system user
* groups looked up from LDAP can be mapped to logical roles
* if no group-to-role mapping is provided, then the group names are used as role names with no translation

The above configuration has been tested against http://directory.apache.org/apacheds/[ApacheDS], v1.5.7. This can be administered using http://directory.apache.org/studio/[Apache Directory Studio], v1.5.3.

=== Using a shared role/perms path

As an alternative to injecting the `permissionsByRole` property, the role/permission mapping can alternatively be specified by injecting a resource path:

[source]
----
ldapRealm.resourcePath=classpath:webapp/myroles.ini
----

where `myroles.ini` is in `src/main/resources/webapp`, and takes the form:

[source]
----
 [roles]
 user_role = *:ToDoItemsJdo:*:*,\
             *:ToDoItem:*:*
 self-install_role = *:ToDoItemsFixturesService:install:*
 admin_role = *
----

This separation of the role/mapping can be useful if Shiro is configured to support multiple realms (eg an LdapRealm based one and also an TextRealm)

=== Active DS LDAP Configuration

The screenshot below shows the ApacheDS using Apache Directory Studio. The setup here was initially base on http://krams915.blogspot.co.uk/2011/01/ldap-apache-directory-studio-basic.html[this tutorial]. However, user accounts have been moved to a separate node.

==== Configure Mojo partition and nodes under Root

Create a partition in order to hold the mojo node (holding the groups)

Create the `ou=groups,o=mojo` hierarchy

Configure SASL authentication. This means that the checking of user/password is done implicitly by virtue of Isis connecting to LDAP using these credentials.

In order for SASL to work, it seems to be necessary to put users under `o=system`. (This is why the setup is slightly different than the tutorial mentioned above).

Configure the users into the groups.

== Shiro Realm Mappings

When configuring role based permission mapping, there can only be one of these entries per realm:

[source]
----
realm.groupToRolesMappings = ...
----

and

[source]
----
realm.roleToPermissionsMappings = ...
----

This forces you to put everything on one line for each of the above.

This is, unfortunately, a Shiro "feature". The only solution to this is to use '&#39; to separate the mappings onto separate lines in the file so that it is at least maintainable. 

Use this technique for both group to roles mapping and role to permission mapping. If you use the '&#39; after the "," that separates the key:value pairs it is more readable.

If you repeat the entries above then it's "last one wins".

*Note* you can't use a [roles] section because that triggers Shiro to use the simple "INI" realm and not your defined realm (in most cases you are going to use an LDAP realm in an enterprise environment and the "simple" realm in Shiro isn't much use beyond prototyping work).
