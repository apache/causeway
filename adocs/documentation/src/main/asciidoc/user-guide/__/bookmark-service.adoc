Title: Bookmark Service

The `BookmarkService` provides the ability to obtain a serializable `org.apache.isis.applib.bookmarks.Bookmark` for any (persisted) domain object, and to lookup domain objects given a `Bookmark`.

This is a good way of storing a reference to an arbitrary object (a polymorphic relationship). The downside is that there is no way for the objectstore (eg JDO objectstore) to enforce any kind of referental integrity.

== API

The API defined by `BookmarkService` is:

[source]
----
public interface BookmarkService {

    @NotInServiceMenu
    Object lookup(BookmarkHolder bookmarkHolder);

    @Programmatic
    Object lookup(Bookmark bookmark);

    @Programmatic
    <T> T lookup(Bookmark bookmark, Class<T> requiredType);

    @Programmatic
    Bookmark bookmarkFor(Object domainObject);

    @Programmatic
    Bookmark bookmarkFor(Class<?> cls, String identifier);
}
----

If a domain class implements the `org.apache.isis.applib.bookmarks.BookmarkHolder` interface then the `BookmarkService` will appear as a contributed action. Otherwise the service is hidden from view, intended to be injected into domain objects as a supporting domain service.

== Usage within the framework

Bookmarks are used by the link:./background-service.html[BackgroundCommandService], which uses a bookmark to capture the target object on which an action will be invoked subsequently.

Bookmarks are also used by the link:./publishing-service.html[PublishingService] and the link:./auditing-service.html[AuditingService].

== Implementations

The core framework provides a default implementation of this API:

* `org.apache.isis.core.metamodel.services.bookmarks.BookmarkServiceDefault`

== Register the Service

The `BookmarkServiceDefault` is automatically registered with the framework (it is annotated with `@DomainService`) so there is no need to explicitly register the service.
