Apache Isis&trade; software is a framework for rapidly developing domain-driven apps in Java.
Write your business logic in entities, domain services and repositories, and the framework dynamically generates a representation of that domain model as a webapp or RESTful API.
Use for prototyping or production.




== Getting Started

If you just want to get going quickly, we suggest using our xref:guides/ugfun/ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_getting-started_simpleapp-archetype[Maven archetype].



== Formal Releases

If you want to build Apache Isis from formally released source tarballs, you can download from here:

Core:

* https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/isis/isis-core/isis-1.14.0-source-release.zip[isis-1.14.0] (https://www.apache.org/dist/isis/isis-core/isis-1.14.0-source-release.zip.asc[asc], https://www.apache.org/dist/isis/isis-core/isis-1.14.0-source-release.zip.md5[md5])


Archetype:

* https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/isis/archetype/simpleapp-archetype/simpleapp-archetype-1.14.0-source-release.zip[simpleapp-archetype-1.14.0] (https://www.apache.org/dist/isis/archetype/simpleapp-archetype/simpleapp-archetype-1.14.0-source-release.zip.asc[asc], https://www.apache.org/dist/isis/archetype/simpleapp-archetype/simpleapp-archetype-1.14.0-source-release.zip.md5[md5])



== Verifying Releases

It is essential that you verify the integrity of any downloaded files using the PGP or MD5 signatures.
For more information on signing artifacts and why we do it, check out the http://www.apache.org/dev/release-signing.html[Release Signing FAQ].

The PGP signatures can be verified using PGP or GPG. First download the http://www.apache.org/dist/isis/KEYS[KEYS] as well as the asc signature file for the artifact.
Make sure you get these files from the http://www.apache.org/dist/isis/[main distribution directory], rather than from a mirror.

Then verify the signatures using a command such as:

[source,bash]
----
pgpk -a KEYS
pgpv isis-1.14.0-source-release.zip.asc isis-1.14.0-source-release.zip
----

or

[source,bash]
----
pgp -ka KEYS
pgp isis-1.14.0-source-release.zip.asc isis-1.14.0-source-release.zip
----

or

[source,bash]
----
gpg –import KEYS
gpg -verify isis-1.14.0-source-release.zip.asc isis-1.14.0-source-release.zip
----



Alternatively, you can verify the MD5 signature on the files.
A Unix/Linux program called `md5` or `md5sum` is included in most distributions.
It is also available as part of http://www.gnu.org/software/textutils/textutils.html[GNU Textutils].
Windows users can get binary md5 programs from these (and likely other) places:

* http://www.md5summer.org/[http://www.md5summer.org/]
* http://www.fourmilab.ch/md5/[http://www.fourmilab.ch/md5/]
* http://www.pc-tools.net/win32/md5sums/[http://www.pc-tools.net/win32/md5sums/]

== Source Code

You can also download the Apache Isis source code using:

[source,bash]
----
git clone git://git.apache.org/isis.git
----

or

[source,bash]
----
git clone http://git.apache.org/isis.git
----


The code is also mirrored on http://github.com/apache/isis[github], where you can browse it or fork it.
If you're interested in contributing back to Apache Isis, see xref:guides/dg/dg.adoc#[here].



=== Committers

Committers should use the read/write repo:

[source,bash]
----
https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/isis.git
----


You can browse the repo https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/isis/repo?p=isis.git;a=summary[here].




== Isis add-ons & Incode Catalog

There are also a number of (open source, but not ASF) supporting modules and extensions for you to use:

* the link:http://www.isisaddons.org/[Isis Add-ons] provide technical extensions, such as security, commands, auditing and feature toggles

* the link:http://catalog.incode.org[Incode Catalog] provides business modules, such as documents, notes and communications.

Each module is in a separate github repo, with a demo app to illustrate the module's functionality.
