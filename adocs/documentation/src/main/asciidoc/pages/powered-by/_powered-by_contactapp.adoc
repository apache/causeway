The _Contact App_ is a contact management application (like xref:powered-by.adoc#_powered-by_estatio[Estatio]) developed for and deployed at link:http://eurocommercial.com[Eurocommercial].

This app originated out of our users' need to quickly look up different employees of Eurocommercial's.
At the same time the app managers would need to be able to easily edit or add to the existing contact information.
We decided to create different Contact Groups consisting of multiple Contacts, each with their role within the group.

== Apache Isis with Ionic

Because of the requirements of the app - quick and portable access - we decided to create a mobile app for it
using the link:http://ionicframework.com/[Ionic Framework]. For the backend we decided to use link:http://isis.apache.org[Apache Isis]
since this allowed us to rapidly develop the required backend application and surface a REST API to which the
mobile application could connect. We found that it worked together quite well, and with part of the team
behind http://github.com/estatio/estatio[Estatio] we were able to create an app that is clear to use and manage.

As our first Apache Isis app making use of mobile technologies it opens the doors for more to follow.
Ionic has proven easy to learn and build apps with, and has a helpful community.  Meanwhile we've used
Apache Isis' support for xref:../../guides/ugfun/ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_programming-model_view-models_jaxb[JAXB view models]
and in particular the http://isis.apache.org/guides/ugvro/ugvro.html#__ugvro_simplified-representations_apache-isis-profile[simplified REST representations] introduced in v1.12.0.  The result is code that is easy to follow and enhance.

We expect that the scope of _Contact App_ will expand and new features added, these will (almost certainly) remain open source.
Meanwhile we're now set up nicely to build further mobile apps using this technology stack.
