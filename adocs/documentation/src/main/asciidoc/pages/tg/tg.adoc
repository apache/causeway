== Tutorials

This page contains a couple of tutorials for you to follow.

* the xref:tg.adoc#_tg_tutorials_pet-clinic["petclinic"] tutorial takes you step-by-step through building a simple application of just three classes.  There are example solutions in the github repo in case you get lost.

* an xref:tg.adoc#_tg_tutorials_pet-clinic-extended[extended version] of the "petclinic" tutorial, (with the text hosted on github repo).

* the xref:tg.adoc#_tg_tutorials_stop-scaffolding-start-coding["stop scaffolding, start coding"] tutorial is taken from a conference workshop.  It has less hand-holding, but lists out the steps for you to follow.  It's a good cookbook to follow when you're readng to take things further.

Have fun!
