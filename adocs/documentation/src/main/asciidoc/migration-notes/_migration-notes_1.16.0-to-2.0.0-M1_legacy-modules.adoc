Deprecated types have been moved into new "legacy" modules.
 For example, applib types have been moved into `org.apache.isis.core:isis-core-applib-legacy` module.
Generally speaking these types remain in the same package; in some cases they have been renamed.

[WARNING]
====
These modules will be removed for the final release of 2.0.0.

== applib-legacy

Deprecated types have been moved into a new `org.apache.isis.core:isis-core-applib-legacy` module.

The most significant type that has been deprecated is the `DomainObjectContainer` type, but there are several others also.

No replacement.

No replacement.

|`ExceptionRecognizer +
AbstractLegacy`
|Copy of the 1.16.x version of `ExceptionRecognizerAbstract`, with the original dependency on guava.
Refactor to use the new `ExceptionRecognizerAbstract` (which uses Java 8 predicates etc. instead)


|`ExceptionRecognizer +
ForTypeLegacy`
|Copy of the 1.16.x version of  `ExceptionRecognizerForType`, but with the original dependency on guava.
Replace with the new `ExceptionRecognizerForType` which uses Java 8 predicates etc.

|`o.a.i.applib. +
services.memento`
|`MementoService`
|No replacement.
Originally provided as a utility to view models that implemented `ViewModel` interface (as opposed to the newer approaches of annotating with `@ViewModel` or as a JAXB DTO class.

Note that the framework-provided implementation, `MementoServiceDefault`, has been moved out to the corresponding `runtime-legacy` module.

|`o.a.i.applib. +
services.repository`
|`RepositoryServiceLegacy`
|Copy of the 1.16.x version of `RepositoryService`, with the original dependency on guava.
Refactor to use the new `RepositoryService` (which uses Java 8 predicates etc. instead).

Note that the framework-provided implementation, `RepositoryServiceLegacyInternalDefault`, has been moved out to the corresponding `metamodel-legacy` module.

|`o.a.i.applib. +
services.urlencoding`
|`UrlEncodingService +
UsingBaseEncoding +
WithSupportForLargeUrlsAbstract`
|The `UrlEncodingServiceWithCompression` (provided as the default implementation by the core framework) can be used in most cases.


|`o.a.i.applib. +
util`
|`ObjectContractsLegacy`
|Copy of the 1.16.x version of `ObjectContracts`, which heavily uses reflection.
Use `ObjectContracts` instead.
This provides a new API that does not require reflection and instead encourages a different coding style, but does also still support the old API.

|Use JDK8 `LocalDate`, `LocalDateTime` or Joda `DateTime` or `LocalDate` or `LocalDateTime`


|`Time`

|`Timestamp`
|Use `java.sql.Timestamp` or JDK8 `DateTime` or Joda `DateTime` instead

== unittestupport-legacy

TODO

== transition-1-2

TODO


== metamodel-legacy

Contains facet factories (which build up the metamodel) for these types moved from applib to applib-legacy:

* `Encodeable` and `Parseable` interfaces
* `Date`, `DateTime`, `Time` and `Timestamp` value types

It provides contains an implementation of `ProgrammingModelPlugin` interface which is used to register these facet factories in a pluggable fashion.

Similarly, it also provides implementations of the `ValuePropertyPlugin` interface which aggregate the set of value types, used for the swagger UI support.


Finally, it also contains these framework-provided service implementations:

* `DomainObjectContainerDefault` (for `DomainObjectContainer`)

* `RepositoryServiceLegacyInternalDefault` (for `RepositoryServiceLegacy`)
