Existing projects written against v1.9.0 should run against v1.10.0 with only a few minor changes.
If you *do* encounter any difficulties then let us know via the link:https://isis.apache.org/versions/1.10.0/support.html#[users mailing list], so we can support you and document issues here.


== Remove references to `isis-viewer-wicket` parent pom.

In earlier releases the Wicket viewer defined its own parent `pom.xml` for dependency management and its dependencies
and to declare the various submodules that make up the viewer.  This `pom.xml` has now been incorporated into the
parent `pom.xml` for the Core framework.

Therefore, in the parent `pom.xml` of your own domain applications, remove:

[source,xml]
----
<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
        ...
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.apache.isis.viewer</groupId>
            <artifactId>isis-viewer-wicket</artifactId>
            <version>${isis.version}</version>
            <type>pom</type>
            <scope>import</scope>
        </dependency>
        ...
    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
----




== `allowLateRegistration`

One possible issue is that (as per link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ISIS-830[ISIS-830]) the link:https://isis.apache.org/versions/1.10.0/guides/rgsvc/rgsvc.html#_rgsvc_core-domain-api_EventBusService[`EventBusService`] is now initialized as one of the first domain
services; this is to ensure that any object lifecycle events caused by domain services initializing themselves can be
posted on the event bus for subscribers.  The typical case for such lifecycle events to occur is from domain services
that seed reference data; one such example can be found in the (non-ASF) link:http://platform.incode.org[Incode Platform^]'s security module.

In previous releases, the ordering of initialization for the `EventBusService` was undefined (but would typically be towards the
"end" of the list of services.  What this meant in practice is that it generally didn't matter whether (domain service)
subscribers were initialized before or after seed services.

Now, though, because the `EventBusService` is initialized early on, it proactively checks that all subscribers have
been registered before any event posts occur (so that no events get missed).  If any subscriber attempts to register
after at least one event has been posted, then the service will fail fast and the framework will not start.  The error looks something like:

[source,log]
----

seed-users-and-roles-fixture-script/isis-applib-fixture-results-role-and-permissions

  at

----


To ensure that subscriber domain services are initialized before "seed" domain services, the link:https://isis.apache.org/versions/1.10.0/guides/rgant/rgant.html#_rgant-DomainServiceLayout_menuOrder[`@DomainServiceLayout#menuOrder()`] attribute can be used.
Normally this attribute is just used to order UI-visible services on the menu bars, but it also is used
internally to sequence the internal list of services being initialized.

Alternatively, you can disable this checking within the `EventBusService` using:

[source,ini]
----
isis.services.eventbus.allowLateRegistration=true
----

If you do that, be aware that not all subscribers may not receive some events generated by other domain services.

For more details, see the link:https://isis.apache.org/versions/1.10.0/guides/rgsvc/rgsvc.html#_rgsvc_core-domain-api_EventBusService[`EventBusService`] man page.



== Simplify domain events

The domain event superclasses now provide no-arg versions; the framework will use new (non-API) setters to initialize.

This means that domain events can be substantially simplified, eg from this:

[source,java]
----
public class ToDoItem {
    public static class CompletedEvent extends ActionDomainEvent<ToDoItem> {
        private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
        public CompletedEvent(
                final ToDoItem source,
                final Identifier identifier,
                final Object... arguments) {
            super("completed", source, identifier, arguments);
        }
    }
    @Action(domainEvent=CompletedEvent.class)
    public ToDoItem completed() { ... }
}
----

to just this:

[source,java]
----
public class ToDoItem {
    public static class CompletedEvent extends ActionDomainEvent<ToDoItem> { }  // <1>
    @Action(domainEvent=CompletedEvent.class)
    public ToDoItem completed() { ... }
}
----



== isis-maven-plugin

The way that the Isis Maven plugin is configured has changed slightly; check out its link:https://isis.apache.org/versions/1.10.0/guides/rgmvn/rgmvn.html#[documentation] for full details.
