This section (appendix) describes the prerequisites for the xref:../cgcom/cgcom.adoc#_cgcom_release-process[release process].



== Configure toolchains plugin

Apache Isis releases are built using Java 7, enforced using the maven toolchains plugin.
Ensure that Java 7 is installed and the toolchains plugin is configured, as described in the xref:../dg/dg.adoc#__dg_building-isis_configure-maven-toolchains-plugin[contributors' guide].



== Public/private key

The most important configuration you require is to set up public/private key pair.
This is used by the `maven-release-plugin` to sign the code artifacts.
See the page on xref:../cgcom/cgcom.adoc#_cgcom_key-generation[key generation] for more details.

In order to prepare the release, you'll (need to) have a `~/.gnupg` directory with the relevant files (`gpg.conf`, `pubring.gpg`, `secring.gpg` etc), and have `gpg` on your operating system PATH.


[NOTE]
====
If on Windows, the equivalent directory is `c:\users\xxx\appdata\roaming\gnupg`.
For `gpg`, use either http://cygwin.com[cygwin.com] or http://www.gpg4win.org[gpg4win.org].

Note also that the mSysGit version of `gpg.exe` (as provided by GitHub's bash client) is not compatible with that provided by cygwin; move it to one side and check that `gpg.exe` being used is that from gpg4win.

If you use Atlassian's SourceTree, this also bundles a version of `gpg.exe` that is not compatible (in `C:\Users\xxx\AppData\Local\Atlassian\SourceTree\git_local\usr\bin`); again, move it to one side and instead use the one provided by gpg4win.
====



== Maven `settings.xml`

During the release process the `maven-deploy-plugin` uploads the generated artifacts to a staging repo on the http://repository.apache.org[Apache repository manager]. This requires your Apache LDAP credentials to be specified in your `~/.m2/settings.xml` file:

[source,xml]
----
<settings>
  <servers>
    <server>
      <id>apache.releases.https</id>
      <username>xxxxxxx</username>
      <password>yyyyyyy</password>
    </server>
    ...
  </servers>
  ...
</settings>
----

where `xxxxxxx` and `yyyyyyy` are your Apache LDAP username and password.
For more information, see these http://www.apache.org/dev/publishing-maven-artifacts.html#dev-env[ASF docs].


[NOTE]
====
It is also possible to configure to use `.ssh` secure keys, and thereby avoid hardcoding your Apache LDAP password into your `.m2/settings.xml` file.
A description of how to do this can be found, for example, http://bval.apache.org/release-setup.html[here].
====


Also, set up keyphrase for `gpg`; this avoids being prompted during release:

[source,xml]
----
<profiles>
  <profile>
    <id>gpg</id>
    <properties>
      <gpg.executable>gpg2</gpg.executable>
      <gpg.passphrase>this is not really my passphrase</gpg.passphrase>
    </properties>
  </profile>
  ...
</profiles>

<activeProfiles>
  <activeProfile>gpg</activeProfile>
  ...
</activeProfiles>
----
