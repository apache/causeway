If a patch is received on a JIRA ticket, then it should be reviewed and applied. The commands are slightly different for diff files vs patch files.




== Diff files

If a diff file has been provided, then it can easily be applied using eGit's wizards (Eclipse's Git integration)…

NOTE: FIXME - this stuff needs fleshing out ...




== Patch files

If a patch file has been provided, then it can be applied using command line tools.

=== Inspect the patch

First, take a look at what changes are in the patch. You can do this easily with `git apply`

[source,bash]
----
git apply --stat ISIS-xxx.patch
----

Note that this command does not apply the patch, but only shows you the stats about what itâ€™ll do. After peeking into the patch file with your favorite editor, you can see what the actual changes are.

Next, you're interested in how troublesome the patch is going to be. Git allows you to test the patch before you actually apply it.

[source,bash]
----
git apply --check ISIS-xxx.patch
----

If you don't get any errors, the patch has no conflicts. Otherwise you may see what trouble youâ€™ll run into.


=== Apply a (clean) patch

To apply a clean patch (adding the items and commit/signoff in a single step), use `git am`:

[source,bash]
----
git am --signoff < ISIS-xxx.patch
----

This preserves the original author's commit message.

However, this can fail if the patch file does not contain the original committers email address. In this case you will need to abort the `am` session:

[source,bash]
----
git am abort
----

and continue on by applying a non-clean patch, as described next.



=== Apply a (non-clean) patch

If the patch does not apply cleanly, then the original authors commit message cannot be preserved. This sequence in this case is:

[source,bash]
----
git apply ISIS-xxx.patch
----

Fix up any issues. The add and commit as usual

[source,bash]
----
git add .
git commit -am "<original authors' commit message>" --signoff
----

The `--signoff` simply adds a line to the commit message indicating you have signed off the commit.
