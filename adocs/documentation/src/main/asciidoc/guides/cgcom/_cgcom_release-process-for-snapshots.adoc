Snapshot releases allows the current `-SNAPSHOT` version of the `core` modules  of the framework to be released to the Maven snapshot repository maintained by Apache Software Foundation.

[NOTE]
====
Unless otherwise stated, you should assume that the steps described here are performed in the base directory of the module being released.
====


== Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you've defined the snapshots repo in your local `~/.m2/settings.xml` file:

[source,xml]
----
<settings>
  <servers>
    <!-- To publish a snapshot of some part of Maven -->
    <server>
      <id>apache.snapshots.https</id>
      <username>xxxxxxx</username>
      <password>yyyyyyy</password>
    </server>
    ...
  </servers>
  ...
</settings>
----

where `xxxxxxx` and `yyyyyyy` are your Apache LDAP username and password. For more information, see these http://www.apache.org/dev/publishing-maven-artifacts.html#dev-env[ASF docs].

{note
It is also possible to configure to use `.ssh` secure keys, and thereby avoid hardcoding your Apache LDAP password into your `.m2/settings.xml` file. A description of how to do this can be found, for example, http://bval.apache.org/release-setup.html[here].
}



== Sanity Check

Before deploying the snapshot, perform a quick sanity check.

First, delete all Isis artifacts from your local Maven repo:

[source,bash]
----
rm -rf ~/.m2/repository/org/apache/isis
----

Next, check that the framework builds ok:

[source,bash]
----
cd core
mvn clean install -o
----

Confirm that the versions of the Isis artifacts now cached in your local repository are correct (both those pulled down from Maven central repo, as well as those of the component built locally).



== Deploy

Deploy the framework using:

[source,bsah]
----
cd core
mvn -D deploy=snapshot deploy
----

This will deploy all the modules that make up a release.

[TIP]
====
Expect this to take about 10 minutes, give or take.
====

To confirm that they are present, browse to Apache's https://repository.apache.org[Nexus repository manager] and search for "isis".
