The intent of an "interim" release is to allow a developer team to release their application based on a `-SNAPSHOT` version of the framework.
Since `-SNAPSHOT` changes on a day-to-day basis, the idea is to tag a particular revision and to release this, thereby providing stability/traceability for the application being developed.

Whereas xref:../cgcom/cgcom.adoc#\_cgcom_cutting-a-release.adoc[formal release]s and xref:../cgcom/cgcom.adoc#\_cgcom_release-process-for-snapshots.adoc[snapshot release]s are public (released through the Maven repository maintained by Apache Software Foundation), interim releases are non-public and rely on infrastructure provided by a developer team.
The tagged release resides __not__ in the xref:../../downloads.adoc#\__downloads_source_code[official Apache Isis git repository], but instead in a fork/clone maintained by the developer team.

[NOTE]
====
The procedure developed here was put together for the team working on the xref:../../pages/powered-by/powered-by.adoc#_powered-by_estatio[Estatio app], which maintains its own link:https://github.com/incodehq/isis[fork on github] and uses link:https://www.cloudbees.com/[CloudBees] as a Jenkins build server/private Maven repo.
====


== Prerequisites

Create a remote fork/clone of the Apache Isis repository (eg using link:http://github.com[github] or link:http://bitbucket.org[bitbucket] or similar), and ensure that your local fork specifies this remote.

Also, set up a CI server against your fork/clone, to build against any branches called `origin/interim/*`.
To build it should use the command:

[source,bash]
----
mvn clean install -Dskip.app -Dskip.arch
----

that is, skipping the example simpleapp and archetype; only `core` framework is built

The CI server should then also publish the resultant artifacts to a local Maven repository.
For example, Jenkins provides post-build plugins to perform such a task.



== Sanity Check

Ensure that the framework builds ok using the same command that your CI server is set up to execute (see section above).



== Release

Deploy the framework using:

[source,bsah]
----
sh interim-release.sh xxx yyyyy
----

where `xxx` is the most recent release of Isis (to act as the base), and `yyyyy` is the name of the remote.

For example,

[source,bash]
----
sh interim-release.sh 1.13.0 incodehq
----

This will result in a new branch and tagged being pushed to the remote, with an appropriate version (details below).

As noted in the prereqs (above), the CI server configured should then detect the new branch (or tag, if you prefer), build the framework (skipping application and architecture, as in the prerequisites) and then publish the resultant artifacts to a private Maven repo.



=== Implementation details

The script itself:

* removes any local branches called `interim/*`
* creates a new branch called `interim/YYYYmmDD-HHMM`
** eg `interim/1.13.0.20160909-0758`
* updates the version of the pom.xml to the baseline plus the date
** eg `<version>1.13.0.20160909-0758</version>`
* commits the changes and tags the new commit
** eg `isis-1.13.0.20160909-0758`
* removes any remote branches called `interim/*`
* pushes both the branch and the tag to the remote.
