The release process consists of:

* the release manager cutting the release (documented xref:cg.adoc#_cg_committers_cutting-a-release[here])
* members of the Apache Isis PMC voting on the release (documented xref:cg.adoc#_cg_committers_verifying-releases[here])
* the release manager performing post-release tasks (documented below for if vote was successful, else xref:cg.adoc#_cg_committers_post-release-unsuccessful[here if unsuccessful]).

For a vote to succeed, there must be +3 votes from PMC members, and the vote must have been open at least 72 hours.  If there are not +3 votes after this time then it is perfectly permissible to keep the vote open longer.

This section describes the steps to perform if the vote has been successful.




== Inform dev ML

Post the results to the `dev@isis.a.o` mailing list:

[source,bash]
----
[RESULT] [VOTE] Apache Isis Core release 1.9.0
----

using the body (alter last line as appropriate):

[source,bash]
----
The vote has completed with the following result :

  +1 (binding): <i>list of names</i>
  +1 (non binding): <i>list of names</i>

  -1 (binding): <i>list of names</i>
  -1 (non binding): <i>list of names</i>

The vote is SUCCESSFUL.
----



== Update tags

Replace the `-RCn` tag with another without the qualifier.

You can do this using the `scripts/promoterctag.sh` script; for example:

[source,bash]
----
sh scripts/promoterctag isis-1.9.0 RC1
sh scripts/promoterctag simpleapp-archetype-1.9.0 RC1
----


Then, continue onto the next section for the steps to promote and announce the release.




== Release to Maven Central

From the Nexus pages, select the staging repository and select 'release' from the top menu.


image::{_imagesdir}release-process/nexus-release-1.png[width="600px",link="{_imagesdir}release-process/nexus-release-1.png"]

This moves the release artifacts into an Apache releases repository; from there they will be automatically moved to the Maven repository.




== Release Source Zip

As described in link:the http://www.apache.org/dev/release-publishing.html#distribution_dist[Apache documentation], each Apache TLP has a `release/TLP-name` directory in the distribution Subversion repository at link:https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist[https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist]. Once a release vote passes, the release manager should `svn add` the artifacts (plus signature and hash files) into this location. The release is then automatically pushed to http://www.apache.org/dist/[http://www.apache.org/dist/] by `svnpubsub`. Only the most recent release of each supported release line should be contained here, old versions should be deleted.

Each project is responsible for the structure of its directory. The directory structure of Apache Isis reflects the directory structure in our git source code repo:

[source]
----
isis/
  core/
  example/
    archetype/
      simpleapp/
----

If necessary, checkout this directory structure:

[source,bash]
----
svn co https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/isis isis-dist
----

Next, add the new release into the appropriate directory, and delete any previous release. You can use link:upd_sh[the upd.sh script] to help; this downloads the artefacts from the Nexus release repository, adds the artefacts to subsversion and deletes the previous version.

At the end, commit the changes:

[source]
----
svn commit -m "publishing isis source releases to dist.apache.org"
----




== Update JIRA

=== Generate Release Notes

From the root directory, generate the release notes for the current release, in Asciidoc format; eg:

[source,bash]
----
sh scripts/jira-release-notes.sh ISIS 1.9.0 > /tmp/1
----


=== Close tickets

Close all JIRA tickets for the release, or moved to future releases if not yet addressed. Any tickets that were partially implemented should be closed, and new tickets created for the functionality on the ticket not yet implemented.



=== Mark the version as released

In JIRA, go to the administration section for the Apache Isis project and update the versions as released.


=== Create new JIRA

Create a new JIRA ticket as a catch-all for the _next_ release.




== Update website

Update the Apache Isis (asciidoc) website:

* Paste in the JIRA-generated release notes generated above, adding to top of `adocs/documentation/src/main/asciidoc/release-notes.adoc`.  Also add a summary line for the release.

* Search for any `-SNAPSHOT` suffices, and remove

* Update the link:../download.html[download page] with a link to the source release zip file (under https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/isis[https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/isis])

* update the link:../doap_isis.rdf[DOAP RDF] file (which provides a machine-parseable description of the project) should also be updated with details of the new release. Validate using the http://www.w3.org/RDF/Validator/[W3C RDF Validator] service. +
+
For more information on DOAP files, see these http://projects.apache.org/doap.html[Apache policy docs].

* Update the https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/isis/repo?p=isis.git;a=blob_plain;f=STATUS;hb=HEAD[STATUS] file (in root of Apache Isis' source) should be updated with details of the new release.


Don't forget to commit the `.adoc` changes and publish to the isis-site repo.





== Announce the release

Announce the release to link:mailto:users@isis.apache.org[users mailing list].

For example, for a release of Apache Isis Core, use the following subject:

[source,bash]
----
[ANN] Apache Isis version 1.9.0 Released
----

And use the following body (summarizing the main points as required):

[source]
----
The Apache Isis team is pleased to announce the release of:
* Apache Isis Core version 1.9.0
* SimpleApp Archetype 1.9.0

New features in this release include:
- ...

Full release notes are available on the Apache Isis website at [1].

Note that:
* ...

You can access this release directly from the Maven central repo [2],
or download the release and build it from source [3].

Enjoy!

----




== Blog post

Finally, https://blogs.apache.org/roller-ui/login.rol[log onto] the http://blogs.apache.org/isis/[Apache blog] and create a new post. Copy-n-paste the above mailing list announcement should suffice.





== Merge in release branch

Because we release from a branch, the changes made in the branch (changes to `pom.xml` made by the `maven-release-plugin`, or any manual edits) should be merged back from the release branch back into the `master` branch:

[source,bash]
----
git checkout master                   # update master with latest
git pull
git merge isis-1.9.0                  # merge branch onto master
git branch -d isis-1.9.0              # branch no longer needed
git push origin --delete isis-1.9.0   # remote branch no longer needed
----





== Tidy up code

With the release complete, now is a good time to bump versions of dependencies (so that there is a full release cycle to identify any possible issues).

You will probably want to create a new JIRA ticket for these updates (or if minor then use the "catch-all" JIRA ticket raised earlier for the next release).


=== Update parent of Core

Check (via link:http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22org.apache%22%20a%3A%22apache%22[search.maven.org]) whether there is a newer version of the Apache parent `org.apache:apache`.

If there is, update the `&lt;version&gt;` in the `&lt;parent&gt;` element in the parent POM to match the newer version:

[source,xml]
----
<parent>
    <groupId>org.apache</groupId>
    <artifactId>apache</artifactId>
    <version>NN</version>
    <relativePath />
</parent>
----

where `NN` is the updated version number.



=== Update plugin versions

The `maven-versions-plugin` should be used to determine if there are newer versions of any of the plugins used to build Apache Isis. Since this goes off to the internet, it may take a minute or two to run:

[source,bash]
----
mvn versions:display-plugin-updates > /tmp/foo
grep "\->" /tmp/foo | /bin/sort -u
----

Review the generated output and make updates as you see fit. (However, if updating, please check by searching for known issues with newer versions).



=== Update dependency versions

The `maven-versions-plugin` should be used to determine if there are newer versions of any of Isis' dependencies. Since this goes off to the internet, it may take a minute or two to run:

[source,bash]
----
mvn versions:display-dependency-updates > /tmp/foo
grep "\->" /tmp/foo | /bin/sort -u
----

Update any of the dependencies that are out-of-date. That said, do note that some dependencies may show up with a new dependency, when in fact the dependency is for an old, badly named version. Also, there may be new dependencies that you do not wish to move to, eg release candidates or milestones.

For example, here is a report showing both of these cases:

[source,bash]
----
[INFO]   asm:asm ..................................... 3.3.1 -> 20041228.180559
[INFO]   commons-httpclient:commons-httpclient .......... 3.1 -> 3.1-jbossorg-1
[INFO]   commons-logging:commons-logging ......... 1.1.1 -> 99.0-does-not-exist
[INFO]   dom4j:dom4j ................................. 1.6.1 -> 20040902.021138
[INFO]   org.datanucleus:datanucleus-api-jdo ................ 3.1.2 -> 3.2.0-m1
[INFO]   org.datanucleus:datanucleus-core ................... 3.1.2 -> 3.2.0-m1
[INFO]   org.datanucleus:datanucleus-jodatime ............... 3.1.1 -> 3.2.0-m1
[INFO]   org.datanucleus:datanucleus-rdbms .................. 3.1.2 -> 3.2.0-m1
[INFO]   org.easymock:easymock ................................... 2.5.2 -> 3.1
[INFO]   org.jboss.resteasy:resteasy-jaxrs ............. 2.3.1.GA -> 3.0-beta-1
----

For these artifacts you will need to search http://search.maven.org[Maven central repo] directly yourself to confirm there are no newer dependencies not shown in this list.



=== Code cleanup / formatting

While we're at it, this is also a good time to make source code has been cleaned up and formatted according to the Apache Isis and ASF conventions. Use link:resources/Apache-code-style-formatting.xml[this] Eclipse template and link:resources/isis.importorder[this] import order.



=== Push changes

Finally, push the changes up to origin:

[source,bash]
----
git fetch    # check no new commits on origin/master
git push
----


== Update Isis Addons

Once the Apache Isis release is available, all of the (non-ASF) link:http://isisaddons.org[Isis Addons] should also be released.

For each add-on:

* update its dependency on Apache Isis to reference the newly released version
** all the addons define their dependency in the `<isis.version>` property, so search for this string across all `pom.xml` files
* use the `release.sh` script (that each provides) to release.

You can use this https://gist.github.com/danhaywood/3129b688be3628322c01[gist] to invoke `release.sh` across all (or selected) addons.
