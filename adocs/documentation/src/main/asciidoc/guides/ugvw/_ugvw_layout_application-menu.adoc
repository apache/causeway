The actions of domain services are made available as an application menu bar. By default each domain service
corresponds to a single menu on this menu bar, with its actions as the drop-down menu items. This is rarely exactly
what is required, however. The `@MemberOrder` and `@DomainServiceLayout` annotations can be used to rearrange the
placement of menu items.

The screenshots below are taken from http://github.com/estatio/estatio[Estatio], an open source estate management
application built using Apache Isis.

== @DomainServiceLayout

Menus for domain services can be placed either on a primary, secondary or tertiary menu bar.

image::{_imagesdir}application-menu/layout-menus.png[width="800px",link="{_imagesdir}application-menu/layout-menus.png"]

Within a single top-level menu (eg "Fixed Assets") there can be actions from multiple services. The Wicket viewer
automatically adds a divider between each:

image::{_imagesdir}application-menu/dividers.png[width="400px",link="{_imagesdir}application-menu/dividers.png"]

In the example above the top-level menu combines the actions from the `Properties`, `Units` and `FixedAssetRegistrations`
services. The `Properties` service is annotated:

[source,java]
----
@DomainServiceLayout(
        named="Fixed Assets",
        menuBar = DomainServiceLayout.MenuBar.PRIMARY,
        menuOrder = "10.1"
)
public class Properties ... { ... }
----

while the `Units` service is annotated:

[source,java]
----
@DomainServiceLayout(
        named="Fixed Assets",
        menuBar = DomainServiceLayout.MenuBar.PRIMARY,
        menuOrder = "10.2"
)
public class Units ... { ... }
----

and similarly `FixedAssetRegistrations` is annotated:

[source,java]
----
@DomainServiceLayout(
        named="Fixed Assets",
        menuBar = DomainServiceLayout.MenuBar.PRIMARY,
        menuOrder = "10.3"
)
public class FixedAssetRegistrations ... { ... }
----

Note that in all three cases the value of the `named` attribute and the `menuBar` attribute is the same: "Fixed Assets"
and PRIMARY. This means that all will appear on a "Fixed Assets" menu in the primary menu bar.

Meanwhile the value of `menuOrder` attribute is significant for two reasons:

* for these three services on the same ("Fixed Assets") top-level menu, it determines the relative order of their sections (`Properties` first, then `Units`, then `FixedAssetRegistrations`)
* it determines the placement of the top-level menu itself ("Fixed Assets") with respect to other top-level menus on the menu bar.

To illustrate this latter point, the next top-level menu on the menu bar, "Parties", is placed after "Fixed Assets"
 because the `menuOrder` of the first of its domain services, namely the `Parties` service, is higher than that for
 "Fixed Assets":

[source,java]
----
@DomainServiceLayout(
        named="Parties",
        menuBar = DomainServiceLayout.MenuBar.PRIMARY,
        menuOrder = "20.1"
)
public class Parties ... { ... }
----

Note that only the `menuOrder` of the _first_ domain service is significant in placing the menus along the menu bar;
thereafter the purpose of the `menuOrder` is to order the menu services sections on the menu itself.

== Ordering menu actions

For a given service, the actions within a section on a menu is determined by the `@MemberOrder` annotation. Thus, for
the `Units` domain service, its actions are annotated:

[source,java]
----
public class Units extends EstatioDomainService<Unit> {

    @MemberOrder(sequence = "1")
    public Unit newUnit( ... ) { ... }

    @MemberOrder(sequence = "2")
    public List<Unit> findUnits( ... ) { ... }

    @ActionLayout( prototype = true )
    @MemberOrder(sequence = "99")
    public List<Unit> allUnits() { ... }
    ...
}
----

Note that the last is also a prototype action (meaning it is only displayed in SERVER_PROTOTYPE (=Wicket Development) mode).
In the UI it is rendered in italics.

(It is possible to override this place of a given action by specifying `@MemberOrder(name=&quot;...&quot;)` where the name is
that of a top-level menu. Prior to 1.8.0 this was the only way of doing things, as of 1.8.0 its use
is not recommended).

== Tertiary menubar

The tertiary menu bar consists of a single unnamed menu, rendered underneath the user's login, top right. This is
intended primarily for actions pertaining to the user themselves, eg their account, profile or settings:

image::{_imagesdir}application-menu/tertiary.png[width="300px",link="{_imagesdir}application-menu/tertiary.png"]

Domain services' actions can be associated with the tertiary menu using the same `@DomainServiceLayout` annotation. For
example, the `updateEpochDate(...)` and `listAllSettings(...)` actions come from the following service:

[source,java]
----
@DomainServiceLayout(
        menuBar = DomainServiceLayout.MenuBar.TERTIARY,
        menuOrder = "10.1"
)
public class EstatioAdministrationService ... {

    @MemberOrder(sequence = "1")
    public void updateEpochDate( ... ) { ... }

    @MemberOrder(sequence = "2")
    public List<ApplicationSetting> listAllSettings() { ... }
    ...
}
----

Because the number of items on the tertiary menu is expected to be small and most will pertain to the current user, the
viewer does _not_ place dividers between actions from different services on the tertiary menu.


== Isis Add-on modules

Some of the (non-ASF) link:http://www.isisaddons.org[Isis Addons] modules also provide services whose actions appear in top-level menus.

The http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-security[security]'s module places its domain service menus in three
top-level menus:

* its `ApplicationUsers`, `ApplicationRoles`, `ApplicationPermission`, `ApplicationFeatureViewModels` and
 `ApplicationTenancies` domain services are all grouped together in a single "Security" top-level menu, on the
 SECONDARY menu bar

* its `SecurityModuleAppFixturesService` domain service, which allows the security modules' fixture scripts to be run,
 is placed on a "Prototyping" top-level menu, also on the SECONDARY menu bar

* its `MeService` domain service, which provides the `me()` action, is placed on the TERTIARY menu bar.

Meanwhile the http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-devutils[devutils] module places its actions - to download layouts and
so forth - on a "Prototyping" top-level menu, on the SECONDARY menu bar.

Currently there is no facility to alter the placement of these services. However, their UI can be suppressed
using security or using a xref:../ugbtb/ugbtb.adoc#_ugbtb_hints-and-tips_vetoing-visibility[vetoing subscriber].
