Demo App: Highlighting Current
As a by-the-by, the demo app has one further "trick up its sleeve".
If you run the app you'll notice that the currently selected `DemoObject` is highlighted in the left-hand table of the `HomePageViewModel`.

This is accomplished by having the view model collaborate with a subscribing domain service that configures a CSS class.

We start by ensuring that the `DemoObject` emits an event for its CSS class:

[source,java]
.DemoObject.java
----
@DomainObjectLayout(
...
cssClassUiEvent = DemoObject.CssClassUiEvent.class
)
public class DemoObject ... {

public static class CssClassUiEvent
extends org.apache.isis.applib.events.ui.CssClassUiEvent<DemoObject> {}
...
}
----

Next, we define the domain service to act as the subscriber:

[source,java]
.HomePageViewModel.java
----
public class HomePageViewModel ... {
    @DomainService(nature = NatureOfService.DOMAIN)
    public static class CssHighlighter extends AbstractSubscriber {
        @org.axonframework.eventhandling.EventHandler       // if using axon
        @com.google.common.eventbus.Subscribe               // if using guava
        public void on(DemoObject.CssClassUiEvent ev) {
            if(getContext() == null) { return; }
            if(ev.getSource() == getContext().getSelected()) {      // <1>
                ev.setCssClass("selected");
            }
        }
        private HomePageViewModel getContext() {                    // <2>
            return (HomePageViewModel) scratchpad.get("context");
        }
        void setContext(final HomePageViewModel homePageViewModel) {
            scratchpad.put("context", homePageViewModel);
        }
        @Inject
        Scratchpad scratchpad;                                      // <3>
    }
}
----
<1> If the domain object is the currently selected then set the CSS class
<2> Provide methods to set and get the current `HomePageViewModel` (acting as the context)
<3> Store the context using the `Scratchpad` domain service (request-scoped so thread-safe).

The `HomePageViewModel` is responsible for setting itself as the context for the domain service:

[source,java]
.HomePageViewModel.java
----
public class HomePageViewModel ... {
    ...
    public TranslatableString title() {
        cssHighlighter.setContext(this);        // <1>
        ...
    }
    ...
    @javax.inject.Inject
    CssHighlighter cssHighlighter;
}
----
<1> set the context on the domain service

Finally we just need some CSS, in the `application.css` file:

[source,css]
.application.css
----
.selected {
    font-style: italic; font-weight: bolder;
}
----
