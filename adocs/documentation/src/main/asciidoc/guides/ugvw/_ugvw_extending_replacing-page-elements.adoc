Replacing elements of the page is the most powerful general-purpose way to customize the look-n-feel of the viewer.
Examples in the (non-ASF) link:http://platform.incode.org[Incode Platform^] include the gmap3, fullcalendar2, excel, pdfjs and wickedcharts components.

The pages generated by Apache Isis' Wicket viewer are built up of numerous elements, from fine-grained widgets for property/parameter fields, to much larger components that take responsibility for rendering an entire entity, or a collection of entities.
Under the covers these are all implementations of the the Apache Wicket `Component` API.
The larger components delegate to the smaller, of course.




== How the viewer selects components

Components are created using Apache Isis' `ComponentFactory` interface, which are registered in turn through the `ComponentFactoryRegistrar` interface.
Every component is categorizes by type (the `ComponentType` enum), and Apache Isis uses this to determine which `ComponentFactory` to use.
For example, the `ComponentType.BOOKMARKED_PAGES` is used to locate the `ComponentFactory` that will build the bookmarked pages panel.

Each factory is also handed a model (an implementation of `org.apache.wicket.IModel`) appropriate to its `ComponentType`; this holds the data to be rendered.
For example, `ComponentType.BOOKMARKED_PAGES` is given a `BookmarkedPagesModel`, while `ComponentType.SCALAR_NAME_AND_VALUE` factories are provided a model of type of type `ScalarModel` .

In some cases there are several factories for a given `ComponentType`; this is most notably the case for `ComponentType.SCALAR_NAME_AND_VALUE`.
After doing a first pass selection of candidate factories by `ComponentType`, each factory is then asked if it `appliesTo(Model)`.
This is an opportunity for the factory to check the model itself to see if the data within it is of the appropriate type.

Thus, the `BooleanPanelFactory` checks that the `ScalarModel` holds a boolean, while the `JodaLocalDatePanelFactory` checks to see if it holds `org.joda.time.LocalDate`.

There will typically be only one `ComponentFactory` capable of rendering a particular `ComponentType`/`ScalarModel` combination; at any rate, the framework stops as soon as one is found.

[NOTE]
====
There is one refinement to the above algorithm where multiple component factories might be used to render an object; this is discussed in xref:../ugvw/ugvw.adoc#__ugvw_extending_replacing-page-elements_collections[Additional Views of Collections], below.

== How to replace a component

This design (the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain-of-responsibility_pattern[chain of responsibility] design pattern) makes it quite straightforward to change the rendering of any element of the page.
For example, you might switch out Apache Isis' sliding bookmark panel and replace it with one that presents the bookmarks in some different fashion.

First, you need to write a `ComponentFactory` and corresponding `Component`.
The recommended approach is to start with the source of the `Component` you want to switch out.
For example:

[source,java]
----
public class MyBookmarkedPagesPanelFactory extends ComponentFactoryAbstract {
    public MyBookmarkedPagesPanelFactory() {
        super(ComponentType.BOOKMARKED_PAGES);
    }
    @Override
    public ApplicationAdvice appliesTo(final IModel<?> model) {
        return appliesIf(model instanceof BookmarkedPagesModel);
    }
    @Override
    public Component createComponent(final String id, final IModel<?> model) {
        final BookmarkedPagesModel bookmarkedPagesModel = (BookmarkedPagesModel) model;
        return new MyBookmarkedPagesPanel(id, bookmarkedPagesModel);
    }
}
----

and

[source,java]
----
public class MyBookmarkedPagesPanel
    extends PanelAbstract<BookmarkedPagesModel> {
   ...
}
----

Here `PanelAbstract` ultimately inherits from `org.apache.wicket.Component`.
Your new `Component` uses the information in the provided model (eg `BookmarkedPagesModel`) to know what to render.

Next, you will require a custom implementation of the `ComponentFactoryRegistrar` that registers your custom `ComponentFactory` as a replacement:

[source,java]
----
@Singleton
public class MyComponentFactoryRegistrar extends ComponentFactoryRegistrarDefault {
    @Override
    public void addComponentFactories(ComponentFactoryList componentFactories) {
        super.addComponentFactories(componentFactories);
        componentFactories.add(new MyBookmarkedPagesPanelFactory());
    }
}
----

This will result in the new component being used instead of (that is, discovered prior to) Isis' default implementation.

[WARNING]
====
Previously we suggested using "replace" rather than "add"; however this has unclear semantics for some component types; see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ISIS-996[ISIS-996].
====


Finally (as for other customizations), you need to adjust the Guice bindings in your custom subclass of `IsisWicketApplication`:

[source,java]
----
public class MyAppApplication extends IsisWicketApplication {
    @Override
    protected Module newIsisWicketModule() {
        final Module isisDefaults = super.newIsisWicketModule();
        final Module myAppOverrides = new AbstractModule() {
            @Override
            protected void configure() {
                ...
                bind(ComponentFactoryRegistrar.class)
                    .to(MyComponentFactoryRegistrar.class);
                ...
            }
        };

        return Modules.override(isisDefaults).with(myAppOverrides);
    }
}
----

== Additional Views of Collections

As explained above, in most cases Apache Isis' Wicket viewer will search for the first `ComponentFactory` that can render an element, and use it.
In the case of (either standalone or parented) collections, though, Apache Isis will show all available views.

For example, out-of-the-box Apache Isis provides a table view, a summary view (totals/sums/averages of any data), and a collapsed view.
These are selected by clicking on the toolbar by each collection.

Additional views though could render the objects in the collection as a variety of ways.
Indeed, some third-party implementations in the (non-ASF) link:http://platform.incode.org[Incode Platform^] already exist, including:

* excel component - collection as a downloadable excel spreadsheet
* gmap3 component - render any objects with a location on a map
* pdf.js component - render Blob containined PDF as a scrollable image
* wicked charts component - barchart of any data
* full calendar - render any objects with date properties on a calendar

Registering these custom views is just a matter of adding the appropriate Maven module to the classpath.
Apache Isis uses the JDK `ServiceLoader` API to automatically discover and register the `ComponentFactory` of each such component.

If you want to write your own alternative component and auto-register, then include a file `META-INF/services/org.apache.isis.viewer.wicket.ui.ComponentFactory` whose contents is the fully-qualified class name of the custom `ComponentFactory` that you have written.

Wicket itself has lots of components available at its http://wicketstuff.org[wicketstuff.org] companion website; you might find some of these useful for your own customizations.






== Custom object view (eg dashboard)

One further use case in particular is worth highlighting; the rendering of an entire entity.
Normally entities this is done using `EntityCombinedPanelFactory`, this being the first `ComponentFactory` for the `ComponentType.ENTITY` that is registered in Apache Isis default `ComponentFactoryRegistrarDefault`.

You could, though, register your own `ComponentFactory` for entities that is targeted at a particular class of entity - some sort of object representing a dashboard, for example.
It can use the `EntityModel` provided to it to determine the class of the entity, checking if it is of the appropriate type.
Your custom factory should also be registered before the `EntityCombinedPanelFactory` so that it is checked prior to the default `EntityCombinedPanelFactory`:

[source,java]
----
@Singleton
public class MyComponentFactoryRegistrar extends ComponentFactoryRegistrarDefault {
    @Override
    public void addComponentFactories(ComponentFactoryList componentFactories) {
        componentFactories.add(new DashboardEntityFactory());
        ...
        super.addComponentFactories(componentFactories);
        ...
    }
}
----
