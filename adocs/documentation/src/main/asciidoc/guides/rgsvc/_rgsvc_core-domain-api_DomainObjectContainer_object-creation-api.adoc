The object creation APIs are used to instantiate new domain objects or view models.

[source,java]
----
public interface DomainObjectContainer {

    <T> T newTransientInstance(final Class<T> ofType);                              // <1>
    <T> T newViewModelInstance(final Class<T> ofType, final String memento);        // <2>
    <T> T mixin();                                                                  // <3>
    ...
}
----
<1> create a new non-persisted domain entity.  Any services will be automatically injected into the service.
<2> create a new view model, with the specified memento (as per xref:../rgcms/rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_super_AbstractViewModel[ViewModel#viewModelMemento()].  In general it is easier to just annotate with xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-ViewModel[`@ViewModel`] and let Apache Isis manage the memento automatically.
<3> programmatically instantiate a mixin, as annotated with
xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-Mixin[`@Mixin`] or xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainObject_nature[`@DomainObject#nature()`].

For example:

[source,java]
----
Customer cust = container.newTransientInstance(Customer.class);
cust.setFirstName("Freddie");
cust.setLastName("Mercury");
container.persist(cust);
----

As an alternative to using `newTransientInstance(...)` or `mixin(...)`, you could also simply `new()` up the object.
Doing this will not inject any domain services, but they can be injected manually using xref:rg .adoc#_rgsvc_core-domain-api_DomainObjectContainer_services-api[#injectServicesInto(...)`].

[NOTE]
====
Calling `new(...)` also this circumvents Apache Isis' xref:../rgcms/rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_methods_reserved_created[`created()`]
callback, and in addition any default values for properties (either explicitly set by
xref:../rgcms/rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_methods_prefixes_default[`default...()`] or defaulted implicitly according to Apache Isis'
own conventions) will not be called either.  If you don't intend to use these features, though, the net effect is code
that has less coupling to Isis and is arguably easier to understand (has "less magic" happening).
