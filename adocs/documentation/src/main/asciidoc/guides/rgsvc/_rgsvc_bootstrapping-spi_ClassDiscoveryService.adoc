The `ClassDiscoveryService2` service is used to automatically discover subclasses of any given type on the classpath.
The primary use case is to support "convention-over-configuration" designs that work with a minimum of configuration.

This service is used by the xref:../rgcms/rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_super_FixtureScripts[`FixtureScripts`] service to automatically locate any xref:../rgcms/rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_super_FixtureScript[`FixtureScript`] implementations.



== SPI

The SPI defined by the service is:

[source,java]
----
public interface ClassDiscoveryService2  {
    @Programmatic
    <T> Set<Class<? extends T>> findSubTypesOfClasses(Class<T> type, String packagePrefix);
    @Deprecated
    @Programmatic
    <T> Set<Class<? extends T>> findSubTypesOfClasses(Class<T> type);       // <1>
}
----
<1> no longer used



== Implementation

Isis provides an implementation of this service, namely `o.a.i.applib.services.classdiscovery.ClassDiscoveryServiceUsingReflections`.

[NOTE]
====
This implementation is also used to discover domain services annotated with xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainService[`@DomainService`].
Currently this logic uses the implementation directly, so is not pluggable.
====



== Usage

The usage will vary depending upon the conventions of the design.
As of 1.9.0, the usage of the service has been centralized such that the packages to be scanned are located from the xref:../rgcms/rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_AppManifest-bootstrapping[`AppManifest`]'s `#getModules()` method.

For example, the xref:../ugfun/ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_getting-started_simpleapp-archetype[SimpleApp archetype]'s app manifest includes:

[source,java]
----
public class DomainAppAppManifest implements AppManifest {
    @Override
    public List<Class<?>> getModules() {
        return Arrays.asList(
                DomainAppDomainModule.class,  // domain (entities and repositories)
                DomainAppFixtureModule.class, // fixtures
                DomainAppAppModule.class      // home page service etc
        );
    }
    ...
}
----

where the three module classes in effect define three different package prefixes to search under (for domain services, fixture scripts and persistent entities).

Other usages of the `ClassDiscoveryService` are likely to work in a similar way, requiring some sort of scope to be specified.


== Registering the Services

Assuming that the `configuration-and-annotation` services installer is configured (implicit if using the
`AppManifest` to xref:../rgcms/rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_AppManifest-bootstrapping[bootstrap the app]) then Apache Isis' core implementation of `ClassDiscoveryService2` service is automatically registered and injected (it is annotated with `@DomainService`) so no further configuration is required.

To use an alternative implementation, use xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainServiceLayout_menuOrder[`@DomainServiceLayout#menuOrder()`] (as explained
in the xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#__rgsvc_intro_overriding-the-services[introduction] to this guide).
