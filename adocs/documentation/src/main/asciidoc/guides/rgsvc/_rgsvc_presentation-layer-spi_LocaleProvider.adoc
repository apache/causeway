The `LocaleProvider` service is one of the services that work together to implement Apache Isis' support for i18n, being used by Isis' default implementation of xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_presentation-layer-spi_TranslationService[`TranslationService`].

The role of the service itself is simply to return the `Locale` of the current user.


[NOTE]
====
For the "big picture" and further details on Apache Isis' i18n support, see xref:../ugbtb/ugbtb.adoc#_ugbtb_i18n[here].

== SPI

The SPI defined by this service is:

[source,java]
----
public interface LocaleProvider {
    @Programmatic
    Locale getLocale();
}
----

This is notionally request-scoped, returning the `Locale` of the current user; _not_ that of the server.  (Note that the implementation is not required to actually be xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-RequestScoped[`@RequestScoped`], however).




== Implementation

Isis' xref:../ugvw/ugvw.adoc#[Wicket viewer] provides an implementation of this service (`LocaleProviderWicket`) which leverages Apache Wicket APIs.

[NOTE]
====
Currently there is no equivalent implementation for the xref:../ugvro/ugvro.adoc#[RestfulObjects viewer].
====




== Registering the Services

Assuming that the `configuration-and-annotation` services installer is configured (implicit if using the
`AppManifest` to xref:../rgcms/rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_AppManifest-bootstrapping[bootstrap the app]), __and__ that the
xref:../ugvw/ugvw.adoc#[Wicket viewer] is being used, then an implementation of `LocaleProvider` is
automatically registered and injected (it is annotated with `@DomainService`) so no further configuration is required.

To use an alternative implementation, use
xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainServiceLayout_menuOrder[`@DomainServiceLayout#menuOrder()`] (as explained
in the xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#__rgsvc_intro_overriding-the-services[introduction] to this guide).




== Related Services

This service works in conjunction with xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_presentation-layer-spi_TranslationService[`TranslationService`] and xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_presentation-layer-spi_TranslationsResolver[`TranslationsResolver`] in order to provide i18n support.
