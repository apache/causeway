The `AuditerService` auditing service provides a simple mechanism to capture changes to data.
It is called for each property that has changed on any domain object, as a set of pre- and post-values.



== SPI

The SPI for the service is:

[source,java]
----
public interface AuditerService {
    boolean isEnabled();                                    // <1>
    public void audit(
            UUID transactionId, int sequence,               // <2>
            String targetClassName,
            Bookmark target,                                // <3>
            String memberIdentifier,
            String propertyName,                            // <4>
            String preValue, String postValue,              // <5>
            String user, java.sql.Timestamp timestamp);     // <6>
  }
----
<1> whether this implementation is enabled.
If all configured implementations are disabled, then auditing is suppressed (a minor performance optimization).
<2> together the `transactionId` (misnamed; really is the request/interaction Id) and the `sequence` uniquely identify
the transaction in which the object was changed.
<3> identifies the object that has changed
<4> the property of the object that has changed.
The combination of the `transactionId`, `sequence`, `target` and `propertyName` is unique.
<5> the before and after values of the property (in string format).
If the object was created then "[NEW]" is used as the pre-value; if the object was deleted then "[DELETED]" is used as the post-value.
<6> the user that changed the object, and the date/time that this occurred.

The framework will call this for each and every domain object property that is modified within a transaction.



== Implementations

The framework allows multiple implementations of this service to be registered; all will be called.
The framework provides one implementation of its own, `AuditerServiceLogging` (in `o.a.i.applib.services.audit` package); this
logs simple messages to an SLF4J logger.


For example, this can be configured to write to a separate log file by adding the following to `logging.properties`:

[source,ini]
----
log4j.appender.AuditerServiceLogging=org.apache.log4j.FileAppender
log4j.appender.AuditerServiceLogging.File=./logs/AuditerServiceLogging.log
log4j.appender.AuditerServiceLogging.Append=false
log4j.appender.AuditerServiceLogging.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout
log4j.appender.AuditerServiceLogging.layout.ConversionPattern=%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS} %m%n

log4j.logger.org.apache.isis.applib.services.audit.AuditerServiceLogging=DEBUG,AuditerServiceLogging
log4j.additivity.org.apache.isis.applib.services.audit.AuditerServiceLogging=false
----




== Usage

The typical way to indicate that an object should be audited is to annotate it with the xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainObject_auditing[`@DomainObject#auditing()`] annotation.


== Alternative Implementations

The (non-ASF) link:http://platform.incode.org[Incode Platform^]'s audit module provides an implementation of this service (`AuditerService`), and also provides a number of related domain services (`AuditingServiceMenu`, `AuditingServiceRepository` and `AuditingServiceContributions`).

The (non-ASF) link:http://platform.incode.org[Incode Platform^]'s audit module also provides an implementation, `org.isisaddons.module.audit.dom.AuditerServiceUsingJdo`.
This creates an audit record for each changed property (ie every time that `AuditerService#audit(...)` is called.

The module also provides:

* `AuditingServiceMenu` service which provides actions to search for ``AuditEntry``s, underneath an 'Activity' menu on
the secondary menu bar.

* `AuditingServiceRepository` service to to search for persisted `AuditEntry``s.
None of its actions are visible in the user interface (they are all `@Programmatic`).

* `AuditingServiceContributions` which contributes collections to the xref:../rgcms/rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_mixins_HasTransactionId[ `HasTransactionId`] interface.
This will therefore display all audit entries that occurred in a given request/transaction, in other words whenever a command, a published event or another audit entry is displayed.


These services can be activated by updating the `pom.xml` and updating the `AppManifest#getModules()` method.

If menu items or contributions are not required in the UI, these can be suppressed either using security or by implementing a xref:../ugbtb/ugbtb.adoc#_ugbtb_hints-and-tips_vetoing-visibility[vetoing subscriber].



== Related Services

The auditing service works very well with implementations of xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_persistence-layer-spi_PublisherService[`PublisherService`] that persist the ``Interaction.Execution`` objects obtained from the xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_application-layer-api_InteractionContext[`InteractionContext`] service.
The interaction execution captures the _cause_ of an interaction (an action was invoked, a property was edited), while the `AuditerService` audit entries capture the _effect_ of that interaction in terms of changed state.

The xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_application-layer-spi_CommandService[`CommandService`] can also be combined with the auditer service, however
``Command``s are primarily concerned with capture the _intent_ of an action, not the actual action invocation itself.
