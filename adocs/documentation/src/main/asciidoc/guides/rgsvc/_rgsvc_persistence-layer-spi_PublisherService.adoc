The `PublisherService` API is intended for coarse-grained publish/subscribe for system-to-system interactions, from Apache Isis to some other system.
Events that can be published are action invocations/property edits, and changed objects.
A typical use case is to publish onto a pub/sub bus such as link:http://activemq.apache.org/[ActiveMQ] with link:http://camel.apache.org[Camel] to keep other systems up to date.

An alternative use is for profiling: for each execution (action invocation/property edit) the framework captures metrics of the number of objects loaded or dirtied as the result of that execution.
If the xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_application-layer-api_WrapperFactory[`WrapperFactory`] is used to call other objects then the metrics are captured for each sub-execution.
The framework provides a default implementation, `PublisherServiceLogging`, that will log these execution graphs (in XML form, per the xref:../rgcms/rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_schema-ixn["ixn" schema]) to an SLF4J logger.

Only actions/properties/domain objects annotated for publishing (using xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-Action_publishing[`@Action#publishing()`], xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-Property_publishing[`@Property#publishing()`] or xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainObject_publishing[`@DomainObject#publishing()`]) are published.


== SPI

The SPI defined by the service is:

[source,java]
----
public interface PublisherService {
    void publish(final Interaction.Execution<?, ?> execution);  // <1>
    void publish(final PublishedObjects publishedObjects);      // <2>
}
----
<1> to publish an individual action invocation or property edit, as captured within an `Interaction.Execution`.
<2> to publish a set of changed objects.

Each `Interaction.Execution` has an owning `Interaction`; this is the same object obtainable from xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_spi_InteractionContext[`InteractionContext`].
Implementations that publish member executions can use `Interaction.Execution#getDto()` method to return a DTO (as per the xref:../rgcms/rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_schema-ixn["ixn" schema]) which can be converted into a serializable XML representation using the `InteractionDtoUtils` utility class.
The XML can either serialize a single execution, or can be a "deep" serialization of an execution and all sub-executions.

The full API of `PublishedObjects` itself is:

[source,java]
----
public interface PublishedObjects extends HasTransactionId, HasUsername {
    UUID getTransactionId();                                    // <1>
    String getUsername();                                       // <2>
    Timestamp getCompletedAt();                                 // <3>
    ChangesDto getDto();                                        // <4>

    int getNumberLoaded();                                      // <5>
    int getNumberCreated();
    int getNumberUpdated();
    int getNumberDeleted();
    int getNumberPropertiesModified();
}
----
<1> inherited from `HasTransactionId`, correlates back to the unique identifier of the transaction in which these objects were changed.
<2> inherited from `HasUsername`, is the user that initiated the transaction causing these objects to change
<3> the time that this set of objects was collated (just before the completion of the transaction completes)..
<4> returns a DTO (as per the xref:../rgcms/rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_schema-chg["chg" schema]) which can be converted into a serializable XML representation can be obtained using the `ChangesDtoUtils` utility class.
<5> metrics as to the number of objects loaded, created, updated or deleted and the number of object properties modified (in other words the "size" or "weight" of the transaction).


== Implementations

The framework allows multiple implementations of this service to be registered; all will be called.
The framework provides one implementation of its own, `PublisherServiceLogging` (in `o.a.i.applib.services.publish` package); this logs "deep" serializations to an SLF4J logger.

For example, this can be configured to write to a separate log file by adding the following to `logging.properties`:

[source,ini]
----
log4j.appender.PublisherServiceLogging=org.apache.log4j.FileAppender
log4j.appender.PublisherServiceLogging.File=./logs/PublisherServiceLogging.log
log4j.appender.PublisherServiceLogging.Append=false
log4j.appender.PublisherServiceLogging.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout
log4j.appender.PublisherServiceLogging.layout.ConversionPattern=%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS} %m%n

log4j.logger.org.apache.isis.applib.services.publish.PublisherServiceLogging=DEBUG,PublisherServiceLogging
log4j.additivity.org.apache.isis.applib.services.publish.PublisherServiceLogging=false
----




== Usage

To indicate that:

* an action invocation should be published, annotate it with the xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-Action_publishing[`@Action#publishing()`] annotation.
* an property edit should be published, annotate it with the xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-Property_publishing[`@Property#publishing()`] annotation.
* a changed object should be published is to annotate it with the xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainObject_publishing[`@DomainObject#publishing()`] annotation.



== Alternative Implementations

The (non-ASF) link:http://platform.incode.org[Incode Platform^]'s publishmq module also provides an implementation (`o.ia.m.publishmq.dom.servicespi.PublisherServiceUsingActiveMq`).
This implementation:

* publishes each member execution as an event on an link:http://activemq.apache.org[ActiveMQ] message queue.
* persists each execution as a `PublishedEvent` entity, allowing the event to be republished if necessary.
* provides the ability to log additional `StatusMessage` entities, correlated on the transactionId, useful for diagnosing and monitoring the activity of subscribers of said message queues.


This service can be activated by updating the `pom.xml` and updating the `AppManifest#getModules()` method.

The module also provide services that contribute to the UI.
If contributions are not required in the UI, these can be suppressed either using security or by implementing a xref:../ugbtb/ugbtb.adoc#_ugbtb_hints-and-tips_vetoing-visibility[vetoing subscriber].




== Related Services

This service supports two main use cases:

* coarse-grained publish/subscribe for system-to-system interactions, from Apache Isis to some other system.

* profiling of interactions/transactions, eg to diagnose response/throughput issues.


To support these use cases several other services are involved:

* the xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_application-layer-api_InteractionContext[`InteractionContext`] is used to obtain the `Interaction` from which the member executions are published.

* the (internal) xref:../rgfis/rgfis.adoc#_rgfis_persistence-layer_ChangedObjectsServiceInternal[`ChangedObjectsServiceInternal`] domain service is used to obtain the set of objects modified throughout the transaction

* the (internal) xref:../rgfis/rgfis.adoc#_rgfis_spi_PublisherServiceInternal[`PublisherServiceInternal`] domain service filters these down to those changed objects that are also published (as per xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainObject_publishing[`@DomainObject#publishing()`]) and delegates to the `PublisherService`.

* the xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_persistence-layer-api_MetricsService[`MetricsService`] is used to obtain the objects that are loaded throughout the transaction; this info is used in order to instantiate the `PublishedObjects` object passed through to the `PublisherService`.

The xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_core-domain-api_EventBusService[`EventBusService`] differs from the `PublisherService` in that it is intended for fine-grained publish/subscribe for object-to-object interactions within an Apache Isis domain object model.
The event propagation is strictly in-memory, and there are no restrictions on the object acting as the event; it need not be serializable, for example.
That said, it is possible to obtain a serialization of the action invocation/property edit causing the current event to be raised using xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_application-layer-api_InteractionContext[`InteractionContext`] domain service.
