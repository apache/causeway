The `MetaModelService3` service provides access to a number of aspects of Apache Isis' internal metamodel.


== API


The API defined by the service is:

[source,java]
----
public interface MetaModelService2 {
    Class<?> fromObjectType(String objectType);   // <1>
    String toObjectType(Class<?> domainType);     // <2>
    void rebuild(Class<?> domainType);            // <3>
    List<DomainMember> export();                  // <4>

    enum Sort {                                   // <5>
        VIEW_MODEL, JDO_ENTITY, DOMAIN_SERVICE,
        MIXIN, VALUE, COLLECTION, UNKNOWN;
    }
    enum Mode {
        STRICT,
        RELAXED
    }
    Sort sortOf(Class<?> domainType);             // <6>
    Sort sortOf(Bookmark bookmark);
    Sort sortOf(Class<?> domainType, Mode mode);
    Sort sortOf(Bookmark bookmark, Mode mode);
}
----
<1> reverse lookup of a domain class' object type
<2> lookup of a domain class' object type
<3> invalidate and rebuild the internal metadata (an `ObjectSpecification`) for the specified domain type.
<4> returns a list of representations of each of member of each domain class.
<5> what sort of object a domain type is (or bookmark) represents
<6> whether to throw an exception or return `Sort.UNKNOWN` if the object type is not recognized.  (The overloads with no `Mode` parameter default to strict mode).


== Implementation

The framework provides a default implementation of this service, `o.a.i.c.m.services.metamodel.MetaModelServiceDefault`.


== Registering the Service

Assuming that the `configuration-and-annotation` services installer is configured (implicit if using the
`AppManifest` to xref:../rgcms/rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_AppManifest-bootstrapping[bootstrap the app]) then Apache Isis' core
implementation of `MetamodelService` service is automatically registered and injected (it is annotated with
`@DomainService`) so no further configuration is required.

To use an alternative implementation, use
xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainServiceLayout_menuOrder[`@DomainServiceLayout#menuOrder()`] (as explained
in the xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#__rgsvc_intro_overriding-the-services[introduction] to this guide).


== Related Services

The `MetaModelServiceMenu` provides a method to download all domain members as a CSV.  Internally
this calls `MetaModelService#export()`.  Under the covers this uses the API provided by the
xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_metadata-api_ApplicationFeatureRepository[`ApplicationFeatureRepository`] domain service.
