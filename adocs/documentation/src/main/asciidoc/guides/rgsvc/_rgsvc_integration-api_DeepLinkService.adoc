The `DeepLinkService` provides the ability to obtain a `java.net.URI` that links to a representation of any (persisted) domain entity or
view model.

A typical use case is to generate a clickable link for rendering in an email, PDF, tweet or other communication.



== API & Implementation

The API defined by `DeepLinkService` is:

[source,java]
----
public interface DeepLinkService {
    URI deepLinkFor(Object domainObject); // <1>
}
----
<1> Creates a URI that can be used to obtain a representation of the provided domain object in one of the Apache Isis viewers.

The xref:../ugvw/ugvw.adoc#[Wicket viewer] this provides an implementation for accessing the representation through this viewer.  (For the xref:../ugvro/ugvro.adoc#[RestfulObjects viewer], a URL can be constructed according to the link:http://www.restfulobjects.org[Restful Objects spec] in conjunction with a `Bookmark` obtained via the xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_integration-api_BookmarkService[`BookmarkService`]).



== Usage within the framework

The xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_presentation-layer-spi_EmailNotificationService[`EmailNotificationService`] uses this service in order to generate emails as part of xref:../ugvw/ugvw.adoc#_ugvw_features_user-registration[user registration].



== Implementations

The Wicket viewer core framework provides a default implementation of this API:

* `org.apache.isis.viewer.wicket.viewer.services.DeepLinkServiceWicket`




== Registering the Services

Assuming that the `configuration-and-annotation` services installer is configured (implicit if using the
`AppManifest` to xref:../rgcms/rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_AppManifest-bootstrapping[bootstrap the app]), _and_ that the
xref:../ugvw/ugvw.adoc#[Wicket viewer] is being used, then an implementation of `DeepLinkService` is
automatically registered and injected (it is annotated with `@DomainService`) so no further configuration is required.

To use an alternative implementation, use
xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainServiceLayout_menuOrder[`@DomainServiceLayout#menuOrder()`] (as explained
in the xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#__rgsvc_intro_overriding-the-services[introduction] to this guide).
