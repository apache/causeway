The security API allows the domain object to obtain the identity of the user interacting with said object.

[source,java]
----
public interface DomainObjectContainer {
    UserMemento getUser();
    ...
}
----

where in turn (the essence of) `UserMemento` is:

[source,java]
----
public final class UserMemento {
    public String getName() { ... }
    public boolean isCurrentUser(final String userName) { ... }

    public List<RoleMemento> getRoles() { ... }
    public boolean hasRole(final RoleMemento role) { ... }
    public boolean hasRole(final String roleName) { ... }
    ...
}
----

and `RoleMemento` is simpler still:

[source,java]
----
public final class RoleMemento {
    public String getName() { ... }
    public String getDescription() { ... }
    ...
}
----

The roles associated with the `UserMemento` will be based on the configured xref:../ugsec/ugsec.adoc#[security] (typically Shiro).

In addition, when using the xref:../ugvw/ugvw.adoc#[Wicket viewer] there will be an additional "org.apache.isis.viewer.wicket.roles.USER" role; this is used internally to restrict access to web pages without authenticating.
