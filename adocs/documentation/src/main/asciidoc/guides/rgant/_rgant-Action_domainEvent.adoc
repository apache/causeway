Whenever a domain object (or list of domain objects) is to be rendered, the framework fires off multiple domain events for every property, collection and action of the domain object.
In the cases of the domain object's actions, the events that are fired are:

* hide phase: to check that the action is visible (has not been hidden)
* disable phase: to check that the action is usable (has not been disabled)
* validate phase: to check that the action's arguments are valid
* pre-execute phase: before the invocation of the action
* post-execute: after the invocation of the action

Subscribers subscribe through the xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_core-domain-api_EventBusService[`EventBusService`] using either link:https://github.com/google/guava[Guava] or link:http://www.axonframework.org/[Axon Framework] annotations and can influence each of these phases.

By default the event raised is `ActionDomainEvent.Default`.
For example:

[source,java]
----
public class ToDoItem {
    @Action()
    public ToDoItem completed() { ... }
    ...
}
----


The `domainEvent()` attribute allows a custom subclass to be emitted allowing more precise subscriptions (to those
subclasses) to be defined instead.
This attribute is also supported for
xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-Collection_domainEvent[collections] and xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-Property_domainEvent[properties].

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class ToDoItem {
    public static class CompletedEvent extends ActionDomainEvent<ToDoItem> { }  // <1>
    @Action(domainEvent=CompletedEvent.class)
    public ToDoItem completed() { ... }
}
----

The benefit is that subscribers can be more targeted as to the events that they subscribe to.


[NOTE]
====
The framework provides no-arg constructor and will initialize the domain event using (non-API) setters rather than through the constructor.
This substantially reduces the boilerplate required in subclasses because no explicit constructor is required.

== Subscribers

Subscribers (which must be domain services) subscribe using either the link:https://github.com/google/guava[Guava] API or (if the xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_core-domain-api_EventBusService[`EventBusService`] has been appropriately configured) using the link:http://www.axonframework.org/[Axon Framework] API.  The examples below use the Guava API.

Subscribers can be either coarse-grained (if they subscribe to the top-level event type):

[source,java]
----
@DomainService(nature=NatureOfService.DOMAIN)
public class SomeSubscriber extends AbstractSubscriber {
    @org.axonframework.eventhandling.EventHandler       // if using axon
    @com.google.common.eventbus.Subscribe               // if using guava
    public void on(ActionDomainEvent ev) {
        ...
    }
}
----

or can be fine-grained (by subscribing to specific event subtypes):

[source,java]
----
@DomainService(nature=NatureOfService.DOMAIN)
public class SomeSubscriber extends AbstractSubscriber {
    @org.axonframework.eventhandling.EventHandler       // if using axon
    @com.google.common.eventbus.Subscribe               // if using guava
    public void on(ToDoItem.CompletedEvent ev) {
        ...
    }
}
----



The subscriber's method is called (up to) 5 times:

* whether to veto visibility (hide)
* whether to veto usability (disable)
* whether to veto execution (validate)
* steps to perform prior to the action being invoked
* steps to perform after the action has been invoked

The subscriber can distinguish these by calling `ev.getEventPhase()`.
Thus the general form is:

[source,java]
----
@org.axonframework.eventhandling.EventHandler   // if using axon
@com.google.common.eventbus.Subscribe           // if using guava
public void on(ActionDomainEvent ev) {
    switch(ev.getEventPhase()) {
        case HIDE:
            // call ev.hide() or ev.veto("") to hide the action
            break;
        case DISABLE:
            // call ev.disable("...") or ev.veto("...") to disable the action
            break;
        case VALIDATE:
            // call ev.invalidate("...") or ev.veto("...")
            // if action arguments are invalid
            break;
        case EXECUTING:
            break;
        case EXECUTED:
            break;
    }
}
----

It is also possible to abort the transaction during the executing or executed phases by throwing an exception. If the exception is a subtype of `RecoverableException` then the exception will be rendered as a user-friendly warning (eg Growl/toast) rather than an error.




== Default, Doop and Noop events

If the `domainEvent` attribute is not explicitly specified (is left as its default value, `ActionDomainEvent.Default`), then the framework will, by default, post an event.

If this is not required, then the `isis.reflector.facet.actionAnnotation.domainEvent.postForDefault` configuration property can be set to "false"; this will disable posting.

On the other hand, if the `domainEvent` has been explicitly specified to some subclass, then an event will be posted.
The framework provides `ActionDomainEvent.Doop` as such a subclass, so setting the `domainEvent` attribute to this class will ensure that the event to be posted, irrespective of the configuration property setting.

And, conversely, the framework also provides `ActionDomainEvent.Noop`; if `domainEvent` attribute is set to this class, then no event will be posted.



=== Class-level default

Sometimes a subscriber is interested in all of the actions of a given class, though not any individual action.
A common use case is to hide or disable all actions for some particular object for some particular user group.

For this use, the default action domain event can be annotated using `@DomainObject`:

[source,java]
----
@DomainObject(
    actionDomainEvent=ToDoItem.ActionDomainEventDefault.class
)
public class ToDoItem {
    public static class ActionDomainEventDefault
        extends org.apache.isis.applib.services.eventbus.ActionDomainEvent<Object> { }
    ...

    public void updateDescription(final String description) {
        this.description = description;
    }

}
----


== Raising events programmatically

Normally events are only raised for interactions through the UI.
However, events can be raised programmatically either by calling the xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_core-domain-api_EventBusService[`EventBusService`] API directly, or by emulating the UI by wrapping the target object using the xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_application-layer-api_WrapperFactory[`WrapperFactory`] domain service.
