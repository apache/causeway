The `auditing()` attribute indicates that if the object is modified, then each of its changed properties should be submitted to the registered xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_persistence-layer-spi_AuditerService[`AuditerService`](s).

The default value for the attribute is `AS_CONFIGURED`, meaning that the xref:../rgcfg/rgcfg.adoc#_rgcfg_configuring-core[configuration property] `isis.services.audit.objects` is used to determine the whether the action is audited:

* `all` +
+
all changed properties of objects are audited

* `none` +
+
no changed properties of objects are audited

If there is no configuration property in `isis.properties` then auditing is automatically enabled for domain objects.

This default can be overridden on an object-by-object basis; if `auditing()` is set to `ENABLED` then changed
properties of instances of the domain class are audited irrespective of the configured value; if set to `DISABLED` then
the changed properties of instances are _not_ audited, again irrespective of the configured value.

For example:

[source,java]
----
@DomainObject(
    auditing=Auditing.ENABLED  // <1>
)
public class Customer {
    ...
}
----
<1> because set to enabled, will be audited irrespective of the configured value.
