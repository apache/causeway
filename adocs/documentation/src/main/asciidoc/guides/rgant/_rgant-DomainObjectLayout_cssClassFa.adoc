The `cssClassFa()` attribute is used to specify the name of a link:http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/[Font Awesome icon] name, to be rendered as the domain object's icon.

These attributes can also be applied to xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-ViewModelLayout_cssClassFa[view models] to specify the object's icon, and to xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-ActionLayout_cssClassFa[actions] to specify an icon for the action's representation as a button or menu item.

If necessary the icon specified can be overridden by a particular object instance using the xref:../rgcms/rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_methods_reserved_iconName[`iconName()`] method.



For example:

[source,java]
----
@DomainObjectLayout(
    cssClassFa="fa-check-circle"
)
public class ToDoItem { ... }
----

There can be multiple "fa-" classes, eg to mirror or rotate the icon.
There is no need to include the mandatory `fa` "marker" CSS class; it will be automatically added to the list.
The `fa-` prefix can also be omitted from the class names; it will be prepended to each if required.


The related `cssClassFaPosition()` attribute is currently unused for domain objects; the icon is always rendered to the left.


[TIP]
====
The similar xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainObjectLayout_cssClass[`@DomainObjectLayout#cssClass()`] annotation attribute is also used as a hint to apply CSS, but for wrapping the representation of an object or object member so that it can be styled in an application-specific way.
