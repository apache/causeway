The `editing()` attribute can be used to prevent a property from being modified or cleared, ie to make it read-only.

The related `editingDisabledReason()` attribute specifies the a hard-coded reason why the property cannot be modified directly.

Whether a property is enabled or disabled depends upon these factors:

* whether the domain object has been configured as immutable through the xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#\_rgant-DomainObject_editing[`@DomainObject#editing()`] attribute

* else (that is, if the domain object's editability is specified as being `AS_CONFIGURED`), then the value of the xref:../rgcfg/rgcfg.adoc#\_rgcfg_configuring-core[configuration property] `isis.objects.editing`.  If set to `false`, then the object's properties (and collections) are __not__ editable

* else, then the value of the `@Property(editing=...)` attribute itself

* else, the result of invoking any supporting xref:../rgcms/rgcms.adoc#\_rgcms_methods_prefixes_disable[`disable...()`] supporting methods


Thus, to make a property read-only even if the object would otherwise be editable, use:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {
    @Property(
        editing=Editing.DISABLED,
        editingDisabledReason="The credit rating is derived from multiple factors"
    )
    public int getInitialCreditRating(){ ... }
    public void setInitialCreditRating(int initialCreditRating) { ... }
}
----

[NOTE]
====
To reiterate, it is _not_ possible to enable editing for a property if editing has been disabled at the object-level.

This attribute can also be specified for:

* xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-Collection_editing[collections]
* xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainObject_editing[domain object].
