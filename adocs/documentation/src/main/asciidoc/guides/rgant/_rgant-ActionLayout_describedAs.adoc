The `describedAs()` attribute is used to provide a short description of the action to the user.  In the xref:../ugvw/ugvw.adoc#[Wicket viewer] it is displayed as a 'tool tip'.


For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Customer {
    @ActionLayout(describedAs="Place a repeat order of the last (most recently placed) order")
    public Order placeRepeatOrder(...) { ... }
}
----




== Alternatives

As an alternative to using the annotation, the dynamic xref:../ugvw/ugvw.adoc#_ugvw_layout_file-based[file-based layout] can be used instead.
