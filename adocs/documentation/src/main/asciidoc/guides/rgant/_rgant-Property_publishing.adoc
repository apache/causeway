The `publishing()` attribute determines whether and how a property edit is published via the registered implementation of xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_persistence-layer-spi_PublisherService[`PublisherService`].
This attribute is also supported for xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainObject_publishing[domain objects], where it controls whether changed objects are published as events, and for xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-Property_publishing[`@Property#publishing()`], where it controls whether property edits are published as events.

A common use case is to notify external "downstream" systems of changes in the state of the Isis application.
The default value for the attribute is `AS_CONFIGURED`, meaning that the
xref:../rgcfg/rgcfg.adoc#_rgcfg_configuring-core[configuration property] `isis.services.publish.properties` is used to
determine the whether the property is published:

* `all` +
+
all property edits are published

* `none` +
+
no property edits are published

If there is no configuration property in `isis.properties` then publishing is automatically enabled.

This default can be overridden on an property-by-property basis; if `publishing()` is set to `ENABLED` then the
property edit is published irrespective of the configured value; if set to `DISABLED` then the property edit is
_not_ published, again irrespective of the configured value.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Order {
    @Property(publishing=Publishing.ENABLED)        // <1>
    public int getQuantity() { ... }
    public void setQuantity(int quantity) { ... }
}
----
<1> because set to enabled, will be published irrespective of the configured value.
