Whenever a (persistent) domain object has been modified and has been updated in the database, an "updated" lifecycle
event is fired.

Subscribers subscribe through the xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_core-domain-api_EventBusService[`EventBusService`] and can
use the event to obtain a reference to the domain object.

[WARNING]
====
The object should _not_ be modified during the updated callback.
====

By default the event raised is `ObjectUpdatedEvent.Default`. For example:

[source,java]
----
@DomainObject
public class ToDoItemDto {
    ...
}
----

The purpose of the `updatedLifecycleEvent()` attribute is to allows a custom subclass to be emitted instead.  A similar
attribute is available for other lifecycle events.

For example:

[source,java]
----
@DomainObjectLayout(
    updatedLifecycleEvent=ToDoItem.UpdatedEvent.class
)
public class ToDoItem {
    public static class UpdatedEvent
        extends org.apache.isis.applib.events.lifecycle.ObjectUpdatedEvent<ToDoItem> { }
    ...
}
----

The benefit is that subscribers can be more targeted as to the events that they subscribe to.




== Subscribers

Subscribers (which must be domain services) subscribe using either the link:https://github.com/google/guava[Guava] API or (if the xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_core-domain-api_EventBusService[`EventBusService`] has been appropriately configured) using the link:http://www.axonframework.org/[Axon Framework] API.
The examples below are compatible with both.

Subscribers can be either coarse-grained (if they subscribe to the top-level event type):

[source,java]
----
@DomainService(nature=NatureOfService.DOMAIN)
public class SomeSubscriber extends AbstractSubscriber {
    @org.axonframework.eventhandling.EventHandler       // if using axon
    @com.google.common.eventbus.Subscribe               // if using guava
    public void on(ObjectUpdatedEvent ev) {
        if(ev.getSource() instanceof ToDoItem) { ... }
    }
}
----

or can be fine-grained (by subscribing to specific event subtypes):

[source,java]
----
@DomainService(nature=NatureOfService.DOMAIN)
public class SomeSubscriber extends AbstractSubscriber {
    @org.axonframework.eventhandling.EventHandler       // if using axon
    @com.google.common.eventbus.Subscribe               // if using guava
    public void on(ToDoItem.ObjectUpdatedEvent ev) {
        ...
    }
}
----








== Default, Doop and Noop events

If the `updatedLifecycleEvent` attribute is not explicitly specified (is left as its default value, `ObjectUpdatedEvent.Default`),
then the framework will, by default, post an event.

If this is not required, then the `isis.reflector.facet.domainObjectAnnotation.updatedLifecycleEvent.postForDefault`
configuration property can be set to "false"; this will disable posting.

On the other hand, if the `updatedLifecycleEvent` has been explicitly specified to some subclass, then an event will be posted.
The framework provides `ObjectUpdatedEvent.Doop` as such a subclass, so setting the `updatedLifecycleEvent` attribute to this class
will ensure that the event to be posted, irrespective of the configuration property setting.

And, conversely, the framework also provides `ObjectUpdatedEvent.Noop`; if `updatedLifecycleEvent` attribute is set to this class,
then no event will be posted.
