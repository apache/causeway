The `publishing()` attribute determines whether and how a modified object instance is published via the registered implementation of xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_persistence-layer-spi_PublisherService[`PublisherService`].
This attribute is also supported for xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-Action_publishing[actions], where it controls whether action invocations are published as events, and for xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-Property_publishing[`@Property#publishing()`], where it controls whether property edits are published as events.

A common use case is to notify external "downstream" systems of changes in the state of the Isis application.

The default value for the attribute is `AS_CONFIGURED`, meaning that the xref:../rgcfg/rgcfg.adoc#_rgcfg_configuring-core[configuration property] `isis.services.publish.objects` is used to determine the whether the action is published:

* `all` +
+
all changed objects are published

* `none` +
+
no changed objects are published

If there is no configuration property in `isis.properties` then publishing is automatically disabled for domain objects.

This default can be overridden on an object-by-object basis; if `publishing()` is set to `ENABLED` then changed instances of the domain class are published irrespective of the configured value; if set to `DISABLED` then the changed instances are _not_ published, again irrespective of the configured value.

For example:

[source,java]
----
@DomainObject(
    publishing=Publishing.ENABLED  // <1>
)
public class InterestRate {
    ...
}
----
<1> because set to enabled, will be published irrespective of the configured value.
