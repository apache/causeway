The `paged()` attribute specifies the number of rows to display in a standalone collection, as returned from an action invocation.
This attribute can also be applied to xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-CollectionLayout_paged[collections] and xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-ViewModelLayout_paged[view models].


[WARNING]
====
The xref:../ugvro/ugvro.adoc#[RestfulObjects viewer] currently does not support paging.
The xref:../ugvw/ugvw.adoc#[Wicket viewer] _does_ support paging, but note that the paging is performed client-side rather than server-side.

We therefore recommend that large collections should instead be modelled as actions (to allow filtering to be applied to limit the number of rows).
====


For example:

[source,java]
----
@DomainObjectLayout(paged=15)
public class Order {
    ...
}
----


It is also possible to specify a global default for the page size of standalone collections, using the xref:../rgcfg/rgcfg.adoc#_rgcfg_configuring-core[configuration property] `isis.viewer.paged.standalone`.
