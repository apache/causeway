The `render()` attribute specifies that the collection be rendered either "eagerly" (shown open, displaying its contents) or "lazily" (shown closed, hiding its contents). The terminology here is based on the similar concept of lazy loading of collections in the domain/persistence layer boundary (except that the rendering relates to the presentation/domain layer boundary).


For example:

[source,java]
----
public class Order {
    @CollectionLayout(render=RenderType.EAGERLY)
    public SortedSet<LineItem> getDetails() { ... }
    ...
}
----


[NOTE]
====
Note that xref:../ugfun/ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_how-tos_contributed-members[contributed collections] (which, under the covers are just action invocations against a domain service) are always rendered eagerly.

Also, if a xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-CollectionLayout_defaultView[`@CollectionLayout#defaultView()`] attribute has been specified then that will take precedence over the value of the `render()` attribute.
====

== Alternatives

As an alternative to using the annotation, the dynamic xref:../ugvw/ugvw.adoc#_ugvw_layout_file-based[file-based layout] can be used instead.
