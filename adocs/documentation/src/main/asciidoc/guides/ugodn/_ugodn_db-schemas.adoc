In the same way that Java packages act as a namespace for domain objects, it's good practice to map domain entities to their own (database) schemas.

As of 1.9.0, all the link:http://www.isisaddons.org[Isis Addons] (non-ASF) modules do this.
For example:


[source,java]
----
@javax.jdo.annotations.PersistenceCapable( ...
        schema = "isissecurity",
        table = "ApplicationUser")
public class ApplicationUser ... { ... }
----

results in a `CREATE TABLE` statement of:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE isissecurity."ApplicationUser" (
    ...
)
----


while:

[source,java]
----
@javax.jdo.annotations.PersistenceCapable( ...
        schema = "isisaudit",
        table="AuditEntry")
public class AuditEntry ... { ... }
----

similarly results in:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE isisaudit."AuditEntry" (
    ...
)
----


[TIP]
====
If for some reason you don't want to use schemas (though we strongly recommend that you do), then note that you can override the `@PersistenceCapable` annotation by providing XML metadata (the `mappings.jdo` file).
See the section on xref:../ugodn/ugodn.adoc#_ugodn_configuring[configuring DataNucleus Overriding Annotations] for more details.

== Listener to create schema

JDO/DataNucleus does not automatically create these schema objects, but it _does_ provide a listener callback API on the initialization of each class into the JDO metamodel.

[TIP]
====
Actually, the above statement isn't quite true.
In DN 3.2.x (as used by Apache Isis up to v1.8.0) there was no support for schemas.
As of Apache Isis 1.9.0 and DN 4.0 there is now support.
But we implemented this feature initially against DN 3.2.x, and it still works, so for now we've decided to leave it in.
====

Therefore Apache Isis attaches a listener, `CreateSchemaObjectFromClassMetadata`, that checks for the schema's existence, and creates the schema if required.

The guts of its implementation is:

[source,java]
----
public class CreateSchemaObjectFromClassMetadata
        implements MetaDataListener,
                   DataNucleusPropertiesAware {
    @Override
    public void loaded(final AbstractClassMetaData cmd) { ... }

    protected String buildSqlToCheck(final AbstractClassMetaData cmd) {
        final String schemaName = schemaNameFor(cmd);
        return String.format(
            "SELECT count(*) FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA where SCHEMA_NAME = '%s'", schemaName);
    }
    protected String buildSqlToExec(final AbstractClassMetaData cmd) {
        final String schemaName = schemaNameFor(cmd);
        return String.format("CREATE SCHEMA \"%s\"", schemaName);
    }
}
----

where `MetaDataListener` is the DataNucleus listener API:

[source,java]
----
public interface MetaDataListener {
    void loaded(AbstractClassMetaData cmd);
}
----

Although not formal API, the default `CreateSchemaObjectFromClassMetadata` has been designed to be easily overrideable if you need to tweak it to support other RDBMS'.
Any implementation must implement `org.datanucleus.metadata.MetaDataListener`:

The implementation provided has has been tested for HSQLDB, PostgreSQL and MS SQL Server, and is used automatically unless an alternative implementation is specified (as described in the section below).





== Alternative implementation

An alternative implementation can be registered and used through the following configuration property:

[source,ini]
----
isis.persistor.datanucleus.classMetadataLoadedListener=\
        org.apache.isis.objectstore.jdo.datanucleus.CreateSchemaObjectFromClassMetadata
----


Because this pertains to the JDO Objectstore we suggest you put this configuration property in `WEB-INF/persistor_datanucleus.properties`; but putting it in `isis.properties` will also work.

Any implementation must implement `org.datanucleus.metadata.MetaDataListener`.
In many cases simply subclassing from `CreateSchemaObjectFromClassMetadata` and overriding `buildSqlToCheck(...)` and `buildSqlToExec(...)` should suffice.

If you _do_ need more control, your implementation can also optionally implement `org.apache.isis.objectstore.jdo.datanucleus.DataNucleusPropertiesAware`:

[source,java]
----
public interface DataNucleusPropertiesAware {
    public void setDataNucleusProperties(final Map<String, String> properties);
}
----

This provides access to the properties passed through to JDO/DataNucleus.


[IMPORTANT]
====
If you do extend Apache Isis' `CreateSchemaObjectFromClassMetadata` class for some other database, please https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ISIS[contribute back] your improvements.
