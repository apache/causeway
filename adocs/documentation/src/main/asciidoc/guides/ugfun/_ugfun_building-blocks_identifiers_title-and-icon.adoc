To allow the end-user to distinguish one domain object from another, it is rendered with a title and an icon.
The icon informally identifies the type of the domain object, while the title identifies the instance.

== Title

The title of a domain object is shown in several places: as the main heading for an object; as a link text for an object referencing another object, and also in tables representing collections of objects.

The title is not formally required to be a unique identify the object within its type, but it needs to be "unique enough" that a human user is able to distinguish one instance from another.

The title is usually just a simple string, but the framework also allows for the title to be translated into different locales.

== Icon

Sometimes it's helpful for the icon to represent more than just the object's type; it might also indicate the state of an object.
For example, a shipped `Order` might have a slightly different icon to a yet-to-be-shipped `Order`; or an overdue `Loan` might be distinguished separately from an item that is available.

== CSS Class

In addition to the title and icon, it is also possible for a domain object to provide a CSS class hint.
In conjunction with xref:../ugvw/ugvw.adoc#_ugvw_customisation_tweaking-css-classes[customized CSS] this can be used to apply arbitrary styling; for example each object could be rendered in a page with a different background colour.
