Domain events are fired -- through the internal xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_core-domain-api_EventBusService[event bus] -- for every user interaction with each object member (property, collection or action).

By default, rendering a property causes a `PropertyDomainEvent` to be fired, though the xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-Property_domainEvent[`@Property#domainEvent()`] attribute allows a custom subclass to be specified if necessary.
Similarly, rendering a collection causes a `CollectionDomainEvent` to be fired, and rendering an action causes an `ActionDomainEvent` to be fired.

In fact, each event can be fired up to five times, with the event's `getEventPhase()` method indicating to the subscriber the phase:

* *hide* phase allows the subscriber to hide the member

* *disable* phase allows the subscriber to disable the member.
+
For a property this makes it read-only; for an action this makes it "greyed out".
(Collections are implicitly read-only).

* *validate* phase allows the subscriber to validate the proposed change.
+
For a property this means validating the proposed new value of the property; for an action this means validating the action parameter arguments.
For example, a referential integrity restrict could be implemented here.

* *executing* phase is prior to the actual property edit/action invocation, allowing the subscriber to perform side-effects.
+
For example, a cascade delete could be implemented here.

* *executed* phase is after the actual property edit/action invocation.
+
For example, a business audit event could be implemented here.


For more details on the actual domain event classes, see the xref:../rgcms/rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_domainevent[domain event] section of the relevant reference guide.
