Domain services acting as event subscribers can subscribe to xref:../ugfun/ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_building-blocks_events_domain-events[domain], xref:../ugfun/ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_building-blocks_events_ui-events[UI] and xref:../ugfun/ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_building-blocks_events_lifecycle-events[lifecycle] events, influencing the rendering and behaviour of other objects.

All subscribers must subscribe to the xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_core-domain-api_EventBusService[`EventBusService`]; as this amounts to a few lines of boilerplate it's easiest to inherit from the convenience `AbstractSubscriber` class.

We suggest naming such classes `XxxSubscriptions`, for example:

[source,java]
----
@DomainService(
    nature=NatureOfService.DOMAIN                      // <1>
)
@DomainServiceLayout(
    menuOrder="10",
    name="...",
}
public class CustomerOrderSubscriptions
                    extends AbstractSubscriber {        // <2>

    @org.axonframework.eventhandling.EventHandler       // if using axon
    @com.google.common.eventbus.Subscribe               // if using guava
    public void on(final Customer.DeletedEvent ev) {    // <3>
        Customer customer = ev.getSource();
        orderRepository.delete(customer);
    }

    @Inject
    OrderRepository orderRepository;
}
----
<1> subscriptions do not appear in the UI at all, so should use the domain nature of service
<2> subclass from the `AbstractSubscriber` convenience superclass
<3> the parameter type of the method corresponds to the event emitted on the event bus.
The actual method name does not matter (though it must have `public` visibility).
