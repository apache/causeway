The metadata for domain objects is obtained both xref:../ugvw/ugvw.adoc#_ugvw_layout_annotation-based[annotations] and xref:../ugvw/ugvw.adoc#_ugvw_layout_file-based[files].
There is also deprecated support for reading layouts from `.layout.json` files.
This service provides an SPI (and default implementation) for reading layouts defined in this fashion.


== Default implementation

The default implementation for reading dynamic layout metadata is `org.apache.isis.core.metamodel.layoutmetadata.json.LayoutMetadataReaderFromJson`, which is responsible for reading from the `Xxx.layout.json` files on the classpath (for each domain entity `Xxx`).

You can also implement your own metadata readers and plug them into Apache Isis.  These could read from a different file format, or they could, even, read data dynamically from a URL or database.  (Indeed, one could imagine an implementation whereby users could share layouts, all stored in some central repository).




== API and Implementation

Any reader must implement Apache Isis' internal `LayoutMetadataReader` interface:

[source,java]
----
public interface LayoutMetadataReader {
    public Properties asProperties(Class<?> domainClass) throws ReaderException;
}
----

The implementation "simply" returns a set of properties where the property key is a unique identifier to both the class member and also the facet of the class member to which the metadata relates.

See the implementation of the built-in `LayoutMetadataReaderFromJson` for more detail.

Returning either `null` or throwing an exception indicates that the reader was unable to load any metadata for the specified class.


=== Extended API

Optionally the reader can implement the extended `LayoutMetadaReader2` API:

[source,java]
----
public interface LayoutMetadataReader2 extends LayoutMetadataReader {
    public static class Support {
        public static Support entitiesOnly() {
            return new Support(false,false,false,false,false,false,false);
        }
        ...
        public boolean interfaces() { ... } // <1>
        public boolean anonymous() { ... }  // <2>
        public boolean synthetic() { ... }  // <3>
        public boolean array() { ... }      // <4>
        public boolean enums() { ... }      // <5>
        public boolean applibValueTypes() { // <6>
        public boolean services() { ... }   // <7>
    }
    Support support();
}
----
<1> whether this implementation can provide metadata for interface types.
<2> whether this implementation can provide metadata for anonymous classes.
<3> whether this implementation can provide metadata for synthetic types.
<4> whether this implementation can provide metadata for arrays.
<5> whether this implementation can provide metadata for enums.
<6> whether this implementation can provide metadata for applib value types.
<7> whether this implementation can provide metadata for domain services.

The `support()` method returns a struct class that describes the types of classes are supported by this implementation.

The `LayoutMetadataReaderFromJson` implements this extended API.



== Configuration

Once you have implemented your validator, you must register it with the framework by defining the appropriate configuration property:

[source,ini]
----
isis.reflector.layoutMetadataReaders=\
           com.mycompany.myapp.MyMetaModelValidator,\
           org.apache.isis.core.metamodel.layoutmetadata.json.LayoutMetadataReaderFromJson   # <1>
----
<1> the property replaces any existing metadata readers; if you want to preserve the ability to read from `Xxx.layout.json` then also register Apache Isis' built-in implementation.
