The framework provides default implementations for many of the xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#[domain services].
This is convenient, but sometimes you will want to replace the default implementation with your own service implementation.

For example, suppose you wanted to provide your own implementation of xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_presentation-layer-spi_LocaleProvider[`LocaleProvider`].
The trick is to use the xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainService_menuOrder[`@DomainService#menuOrder()`] attribute, specifying a low number (typically `"1"`).

Here's how:

[source,java]
----
@DomainService(
        nature = NatureOfService.DOMAIN
)
public class MyLocaleProvider implements LocaleProvider {
    @Override
    public Locale getLocale() {
        return ...
    }
}
----

The framework uses the value of the `menuOrder` attribute to determine priority; lowest number wins.

However, there is no need to specify the `menuOrder` attribute: its default value is now set to a lower value (specifically: `Integer.MAX_VALUE - 100`) than all of the framework-provided implementations, and thus always takes precedence.

Thus, if a single instance is to be injected, eg:

[source,java]
----
@javax.inject.Inject
LocalProvider localeProvider;
----

then the custom implementation will be used in preference to the framework's default implementation.

If multiple instances are injected, eg:

[source,java]
----
@javax.inject.Inject
List<LocalProvider> localeProviders;
----

then all implementations will be present in the list, ordered by priority; your custom implementation will be first in the list.





[NOTE]
====
It is also possible to use xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainServiceLayout_menuOrder[`@DomainServiceLayout#menuOrder()`] attribute, rather than xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainService_menuOrder[`@DomainService#menuOrder()`].
The general convention is to use the former only for services that are rendered in the UI, the latter for programmatic services.

If both attributes are present, then the value of xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainServiceLayout_menuOrder[`@DomainServiceLayout#menuOrder()`] is used.

== Decorating existing implementations

It's also quite common to want to decorate the existing implementation (ie have your own implementation delegate to the default); this is also possible and quite easy:

[source,java]
----
@DomainService(
        nature = NatureOfService.DOMAIN
)
@DomainServiceLayout(
        menuOrder = "1"                                                                             // <1>
)
public class MyLocaleProvider implements LocaleProvider {
    @Override
    public Locale getLocale() {
        return getDelegateLocaleProvider().getLocale();                                             // <2>
    }
    Optional<LocaleProvider> delegateLocaleProvider;                                                // <3>
    private LocaleProvider getDelegateLocaleProvider() {
        if(delegateLocaleProvider == null) {
            delegateLocaleProvider = Iterables.tryFind(localeProviders, input -> input != this);    // <4>
        }
        return delegateLocaleProvider.orNull();
    }
    @Inject
    List<LocaleProvider> localeProviders;                                                           // <5>
}
----
<1> takes precedence over the default implementation when injected elsewhere.
<2> this implementation merely delegates to the default implementation
<3> lazily populated
<4> delegate to the first implementation that isn't _this_ implementation (else infinite loop!)
<5> Injects all implementations, including this implemenation
