Normally the title of an object is not persisted to the database, rather it is recomputed automatically from underlying properties.  On occasion though you might want the title to also be persisted; either to make things easier for the DBA, or for an integration scenario, or some other purpose.

We can implement this feature by leveraging the xref:../rgcms/rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_methods_lifecycle_jdo-api[JDO lifecycle].  In the design we discuss here we make it a responsibility of the entities to persist the title as a property, by implementing a `ObjectWithPersistedTitle` interface:

[source,java]
----
public interface ObjectWithPersistedTitle {
    @PropertyLayout(hidden = Where.EVERYWHERE)  // <1>
    String getTitle();
    void setTitle(final String title);
}
----
<1> we don't want to expose this in the UI because the title is already prominently displayed.

We can then define a subscribing domain service that leverage this.

[source,java]
----
@DomainService(nature = NatureOfService.DOMAIN)
public class TitlingService extends AbstractSubscriber {
    @Subscribe
    public void on(final ObjectPersistingEvent ev) {
        handle(ev.getSource());
    }
    @Subscribe
    public void on(final ObjectUpdatingEvent ev) {
        handle(ev.getSource());
    }
    private void handle(final Object persistentInstance) {
        if(persistentInstance instanceof ObjectWithPersistedTitle) {
            final ObjectWithPersistedTitle objectWithPersistedTitle =
                (ObjectWithPersistedTitle) persistentInstance;
            objectWithPersistedTitle.setTitle(titleService.titleOf(objectWithPersistedTitle));
        }
    }
    @Inject
    TitleService titleService;
}
----

It is also possible to accomplish this by accessing the JDO API directly:

[source,java]
----
@RequestScoped
@DomainService(nature = NatureOfService.DOMAIN)
public class TitlingService {
    @PostConstruct
    public void init() {
        isisJdoSupport.getJdoPersistenceManager().addInstanceLifecycleListener(
            new StoreLifecycleListener() {
                @Override
                public void preStore(final InstanceLifecycleEvent event) {
                    final Object persistentInstance = event.getPersistentInstance();
                    if(persistentInstance instanceof ObjectWithPersistedTitle) {
                        final ObjectWithPersistedTitle objectWithPersistedTitle =
                            (ObjectWithPersistedTitle) persistentInstance;
                        objectWithPersistedTitle.setTitle(titleService.titleOf(objectWithPersistedTitle));
                    }
                }
                @Override
                public void postStore(final InstanceLifecycleEvent event) {
                }
            }, null);
    }
    @Inject
    IsisJdoSupport isisJdoSupport;
    @Inject
    TitleService titleService;
}
----

The above is probably the easiest and most straightforward design. One could imagine other designs where the persisted title is stored elsewhere.  It could even be stored off into an link:http://lucene.apache.org/[Apache Lucene] (or similar) database to allow for free-text searches.
