The quickest way to get started with Apache Isis is to run the simple archetype.  This will generate a very simple one-class domain model, called `SimpleObject`, with a single property `name`.

There is also a corresponding `SimpleObjects` domain service which acts as a repository for `SimpleObject` entity.  From this you can easily rename these initial classes, and extend to build up your own Apache Isis domain application.

Finally, the domain service also includes a `HomePageViewModel` which acts as a home page for the app.



== Generating the App

Create a new directory, and `cd` into that directory.

To build the app from the latest stable release, then run the following command:

[source,bash]
----
mvn archetype:generate  \
    -D archetypeGroupId=org.apache.isis.archetype \
    -D archetypeArtifactId=simpleapp-archetype \
    -D archetypeVersion=1.13.1 \
    -D groupId=com.mycompany \
    -D artifactId=myapp \
    -D version=1.0-SNAPSHOT \
    -B
----

where:

- `groupId` represents your own organization, and
- `artifactId` is a unique identifier for this app within your organization.
- `version` is the initial (snapshot) version of your app

The archetype generation process will then run; it only takes a few seconds.


We also maintain the archetype for the most current `-SNAPSHOT`; an app generated with this archetype will contain the latest features of Apache Isis, but the usual caveats apply: some features still in development may be unstable.

The process is almost identical to that for stable releases, however the `archetype:generate` goal is called with slightly different arguments:

[source,bash]
----
mvn archetype:generate  \
    -D archetypeGroupId=org.apache.isis.archetype \
    -D archetypeArtifactId=simpleapp-archetype \
    -D archetypeVersion=1.14.0-SNAPSHOT \
    -D groupId=com.mycompany \
    -D artifactId=myapp \
    -D version=1.0-SNAPSHOT \
    -D archetypeRepository=http://repository-estatio.forge.cloudbees.com/snapshot/ \
    -B
----

where as before:

- `groupId` represents your own organization, and
- `artifactId` is a unique identifier for this app within your organization.
- `version` is the initial (snapshot) version of your app

but also:

- `archetypeVersion` is the SNAPSHOT version of Apache Isis.
- `archetypeRepository` specifies the location of our snapshot repo (hosted on link:http://www.cloudbees.com[CloudBees]), and

The archetype generation process will then run; it only takes a few seconds.



== Building the App

Switch into the root directory of your newly generated app, and build your app:

[source,bash]
----
cd myapp
mvn clean install
----

where `myapp` is the `artifactId` entered above.




== Running the App

The `simpleapp` archetype generates a single WAR file, configured to run both the xref:ugvw.adoc#[Wicket viewer] and the xref:ugvro.adoc#[Restful Objects viewer].  The archetype also configures the DataNucleus/JDO Objectstore to use an in-memory HSQLDB connection.

Once you've built the app, you can run the WAR in a variety of ways.


=== Using mvn Jetty plugin

First, you could run the WAR in a Maven-hosted Jetty instance, though you need to `cd` into the `webapp` module:

[source,bash]
----
cd webapp
mvn jetty:run
----


You can also provide a system property to change the port:

[source,bash]
----
cd webapp
mvn jetty:run -D jetty.port=9090
----


=== Using a regular servlet container

You can also take the built WAR file and deploy it into a standalone servlet container such as [Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org).  The default configuration does not require any configuration of the servlet container; just drop the WAR file into the `webapps` directory.



=== From within the IDE

Most of the time, though, you'll probably want to run the app from within your IDE.  The mechanics of doing this will vary by IDE; see the xref:dg.adoc#_dg_ide[Developers' Guide] for details of setting up Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA.  Basically, though, it amounts to running `org.apache.isis.WebServer`, and ensuring that the xref:ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_getting-started_datanucleus-enhancer[DataNucleus enhancer] has properly processed all domain entities.

Here's what the setup looks like in IntelliJ IDEA:

image::{_imagesdir}getting-started/simpleapp-webapp.png[width="600px",link="{_imagesdir}getting-started/simpleapp-webapp.png"]



== Running with Fixtures

It is also possible to start the application with a pre-defined set of data; useful for demos or manual exploratory testing.  This is done by specifying a xref:ugtst.adoc#_ugtst_fixture-scripts[fixture script] on the command line.

If you are running the app from an IDE, then you can specify the fixture script using the `--fixture` flag.  The archetype provides the `domainapp.fixture.scenarios.RecreateSimpleObjects` fixture script, for example:

image::{_imagesdir}getting-started/simpleapp-webapp-with-fixtures.png[width="600px",link="{_imagesdir}getting-started/simpleapp-webapp-with-fixtures.png"]

Alternatively, you can run with a different xref:rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_AppManifest-bootstrapping[`AppManifest`] using the `--appManifest` (or `-m`) flag.  The archetype provides
`domainapp.app.DomainAppAppManifestWithFixtures` which specifies the aforementioned `RecreateSimpleObjects` fixture.



== Using the App

[NOTE]
====
These screenshots are for v1.10.0.
====


When you start the app, you'll be presented with a welcome page from which you can access the webapp using either the xref:ugvw.adoc#[Wicket viewer] or the xref:ugvro.adoc#[Restful Objects viewer]:

image::{_imagesdir}getting-started/using-simple-app/010-root-page.png[width="600px",link="{_imagesdir}getting-started/using-simple-app/010-root-page.png"]


The Wicket viewer provides a human usable web UI (implemented, as you might have guessed from its name, using link:http://wicket.apache.org[Apache Wicket]), so choose that and navigate to the login page:

image::{_imagesdir}getting-started/using-simple-app/020-login-to-wicket-viewer.png[width="600px",link="{_imagesdir}getting-started/using-simple-app/020-login-to-wicket-viewer.png"]

The app itself is configured to run using xref:ugsec.adoc#[shiro security], as configured in the `WEB-INF/shiro.ini` config file.  You can login with:

* username: _sven_
* password: _pass_

The application is configured to run with an in-memory database, and (unless you started the app with fixture scripts as described above), initially there is no data.  We can though run a fixture script from the app itself:

image::{_imagesdir}getting-started/using-simple-app/030-home-page-run-fixture-scripts.png[width="600px",link="{_imagesdir}getting-started/using-simple-app/030-home-page-run-fixture-scripts.png"]

The fixture script creates three objects, and the action returns the first of these:

image::{_imagesdir}getting-started/using-simple-app/040-first-object.png[width="600px",link="{_imagesdir}getting-started/using-simple-app/040-first-object.png"]

The application generated is deliberaetly very minimal; we don't want you to have to waste valuable time removing generated files.  The object contains a single "name" property, and a single action to update that property:

image::{_imagesdir}getting-started/using-simple-app/050-update-name-prompt.png[width="600px",link="{_imagesdir}getting-started/using-simple-app/050-update-name-prompt.png"]

When you hit OK, the object is updated:

image::{_imagesdir}getting-started/using-simple-app/060-object-updated.png[width="600px",link="{_imagesdir}getting-started/using-simple-app/060-object-updated.png"]


For your most signficant domain entities you'll likely have a domain service to retrieve or create instances of those obejcts.  In the generated app we have a "Simple Objects" domain service that lets us list all objects:

image::{_imagesdir}getting-started/using-simple-app/070-list-all-prompt.png[width="600px",link="{_imagesdir}getting-started/using-simple-app/070-list-all-prompt.png"]

whereby we see the three objects created by the fixture script (one having been updated):

image::{_imagesdir}getting-started/using-simple-app/080-list-all.png[width="600px",link="{_imagesdir}getting-started/using-simple-app/080-list-all.png"]

and we can also use the domain service to create new instances:

image::{_imagesdir}getting-started/using-simple-app/090-create.png[width="600px",link="{_imagesdir}getting-started/using-simple-app/090-create.png"]

prompting us for the mandatory information (the name):

image::{_imagesdir}getting-started/using-simple-app/100-create-prompt.png[width="600px",link="{_imagesdir}getting-started/using-simple-app/100-create-prompt.png"]

which, of course, returns the newly created object:

image::{_imagesdir}getting-started/using-simple-app/110-object-created.png[width="600px",link="{_imagesdir}getting-started/using-simple-app/110-object-created.png"]

When we list all objects again, we can see that the object was indeed created:

image::{_imagesdir}getting-started/using-simple-app/120-list-all.png[width="600px",link="{_imagesdir}getting-started/using-simple-app/120-list-all.png"]

Going back to the home page (link:http://localhost:8080[localhost:8080]) we can also access the Restful Objects viewer.  The generated application is configured to use HTTP Basic Auth:

image::{_imagesdir}getting-started/using-simple-app/220-login-to-restful-viewer.png[width="600px",link="{_imagesdir}getting-started/using-simple-app/220-login-to-restful-viewer.png"]

The Restful Objects viewer provides a REST API for computer-to-computer interaction, but we can still interact with it from a browser:

image::{_imagesdir}getting-started/using-simple-app/230-home-page.png[width="600px",link="{_imagesdir}getting-started/using-simple-app/230-home-page.png"]

[TIP]
====
Depending on your browser, you may need to install plugins.  For Chrome, we recommend json-view (which renders the JSON indented and automatically detects hyperlinks) and REST Postman.
====

The REST API is a complete hypermedia API, in other words you can follow the links to access all the behaviour exposed in the regular Wicket app.  For example, we can navigate to the `listAll/invoke` resource:

image::{_imagesdir}getting-started/using-simple-app/240-list-all-invoke.png[width="600px",link="{_imagesdir}getting-started/using-simple-app/240-list-all-invoke.png"]

which when invoked (with an HTTP GET) will return a representation of the domain objects.

image::{_imagesdir}getting-started/using-simple-app/250-list-all-results.png[width="600px",link="{_imagesdir}getting-started/using-simple-app/250-list-all-results.png"]


To log in, use `sven/pass`.





== Modifying the App

Once you are familiar with the generated app, you'll want to start modifying it.  There is plenty of guidance on this site; check out the 'programming model how-tos' section on the main link:../documentation.html[documentation] page first).

If you use IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse, do also install the xref:dg.adoc#_dg_ide_intellij_live-templates[live templates (for IntelliJ)] / xref:dg.adoc#_dg_ide_eclipse_editor-templates[editor templates (for Eclipse)]; these will help you follow the Apache Isis naming conventions.





== App Structure

As noted above, the generated app is a very simple application consisting of a single domain object that can be easily renamed and extended. The intention is not to showcase all of Apache Isis' capabilities; rather it is to allow you to very easily modify the generated application (eg rename `SimpleObject` to `Customer`) without having to waste time deleting lots of generated code.
