This class is a convenience superclass for domain objects and services, providing general purpose methods for interacting with the framework.
These include:

* `allMatches(Query)` - search for all objects matching the specified `Query`. +
+
+ Note that this, and other similar methods (eg `firstMatch(...)`, `uniqueMatch(...)`) will automatically flush the
current transaction.

* `newTransientInstance(Class)` - to create a new instance of an object, with any services injected into it

* `persistIfNotAlready(Object)` - to persist an object +
+
In fact, the object is queued up to be persisted, and is only actually persisted either when the transaction commits, or
when the transaction is flushed (typically when a query is performed).

* `warnUser(String)` - generate a warning to the user

* `getContainer()` - which returns the `DomainObjectContainer`

Each of these methods simply delegates to an equivalent method in xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_core-domain-api_DomainObjectContainer[`DomainObjectContainer`].

[TIP]
====
In practice we find that there's little to gain from subclassing; it's easier/less obscure to simply inject xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_core-domain-api_DomainObjectContainer[`DomainObjectContainer`] into a simple pojo class.
