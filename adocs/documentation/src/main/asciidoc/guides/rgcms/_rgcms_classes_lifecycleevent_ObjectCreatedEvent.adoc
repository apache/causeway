Subclass of xref:../rgcms/rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_lifecycleevent_AbstractLifecycleEvent[`AbstractLifecycleEvent`], broadcast when an object is first instantiated using the xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_core-domain-api_FactoryService[`FactoryServuce`]'s `#instantiate(...)` method.

`ObjectCreatedEvent.Default` is the implementation that is used by default, but this can be overridden using xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant_DomainObject_createdLifecycleEvent[`@DomainObject#createdLifecycleEvent()`].
