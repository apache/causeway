This class is the superclass for all domain events that are raised by the framework when interacting with actions,
properties or collections.

Its immediate subclasses are:

* xref:../rgcms/rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_domainevent_ActionDomainEvent[`ActionDomainEvent`]

* xref:../rgcms/rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_domainevent_PropertyDomainEvent[`PropertyDomainEvent`]

* xref:../rgcms/rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_domainevent_CollectionDomainEvent[`CollectionDomainEvent`]

The main purpose of the class is to define the protocol by which subscribers can influence an interaction (eg hide a
collection, disable a property, validate action arguments).  It class also provides a simple mechanism to allow
adhoc sharing of user data between different phases.

== API

The API of the class is:

[source,java]
----
public abstract class AbstractDomainEvent<S> extends java.util.EventObject {

    public S getSource();                                           // <1>
    public Object getMixedIn();                                     // <2>
    public Object getSubject();                                     // <3>

    public Identifier getIdentifier();                              // <4>

    public Phase getEventPhase();                                   // <5>

    public void hide();                                             // <6>
    public boolean isHidden();                                      // <7>

    public void disable(final String reason);                       // <8>
    public void disable(final TranslatableString reason);
    public String getDisabledReason();                              // <9>
    public TranslatableString getDisabledReasonTranslatable();
    public boolean isDisabled();

    public void invalidate(final String reason);                    // <10>
    public void invalidate(final TranslatableString reason);
    public String getInvalidityReason();                            // <11>
    public TranslatableString getInvalidityReasonTranslatable();
    public boolean isInvalid();

    public void veto(final String reason, final Object... args);    // <12>
    public void veto(final TranslatableString translatableReason);

    public Object get(Object key);                                  // <13>
    public void put(Object key, Object value);
}
----
<1> The domain object raising this event.
+
For a "regular" action, property or collection then this will be the target domain object.
But for a "mixin" action, this will be an instance of the mixin itself.

<2> For a "mixin", this will be the target object that is being contributed to.
+
For a "regular" action, this will return `null`.

<3> Returns the domain object being interacted with, irrespective of whether this is a "regular" action/property/collection or a "mixin".
+
* For a regular member, this will return the same as `getSource()`.
+
* For a mixin, this will return the same as `getMixedIn()`.

<4> Identifier of the action, property or collection being interacted with.

<5> Whether the framework is checking visibility, enablement, validity or actually executing
(invoking action, editing property), as per the `Phase` enum (defined below).

<6> API for subscribers to hide the member
<7> Used by the framework to determine if the member should be hidden (not rendered)
<8> API for subscribers to disable the member, specifying the reason why (possibly translated)
<9> Used by the framework to determine whether the member should be disabled (greyed out) when rendered.
<10> API for subscribers to invalidate an interaction, eg invalid arguments to an action
<11> Used by the framework to determine whether the interaction is invalid and should be blocked (eg pressing OK shows
message)
<12> Convenience API for subscribers to veto; will automatically call either `hide()`, `disable(...)` or
`invalidate(...)` based on the phase
<13> Mechanism to allow subscribers to share arbitrary information between phases.  One event instance is used for both
the hide and disable phases, and a different event instance is shared between validate/pre-execute/post-execute.

The referenced `Phase` enum is in turn:

[source,java]
----
public enum Phase {
    HIDE,
    DISABLE,
    VALIDATE,
    EXECUTING,
    EXECUTED;
    public boolean isValidatingOrLater();    // <1>
}
----
<1> The significance being that at this point the proposed values/arguments are known, and so the event can be fully
populated.
