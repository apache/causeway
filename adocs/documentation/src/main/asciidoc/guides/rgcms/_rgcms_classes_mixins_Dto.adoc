The `Dto` role interface is intended to be implemented by JAXB-annotated view models, that is, annotated using
xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-XmlRootElement[`@XmlRootElement`].
It enables the ability to download the XML and XSD schema of those objects using two xref:../ugfun/ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_building-blocks_types-of-domain-objects_mixins[mixins], `Dto_downloadXml` and `Dto_downloadXsd`.

The interface is just a marker interface (with no members), and is defined as:

[source,java]
----
public interface Dto { }
----

The `Dto_downloadXml` mixin defines the following action:

[source,java]
----
@Mixin(method="act")
public class Dto_downloadXml {
    public Dto_downloadXml(final Dto dto) { ... }     // <1>
    public Object act(final String fileName) { ... }   // <2>
    ...
}
----
<1> provided as an action to any class that (trivially) implements the `Dto` interface
<2> The action's name is derived from the class name.

This will return the XML text wrapped up in a xref:../rgcms/rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_value-types_Clob[`Clob`].

The `Dto_downloadXsd` mixin is similar:

[source,java]
----
@Mixin(method="act")
public class Dto_downloadXsd {
    public Dto_downloadXsd(final Dto dto) { ... }                                             // <1>
    public Object act(final String fileName, final IsisSchemes isisSchemas) { ... }   // <2>
}
----
<1> provided as an action to any class that (trivially) implements the `Dto` interface
<2> The action's name be derived from the class name.

If the domain object's JAXB annotations reference only a single XSD schema then this will return that XML text as a xref:../rgcms/rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_value-types_Clob[`Clob`] of that XSD.
If there are multiple XSD schemas referenced then the action will return a zip of those schemas, wrapped up in a xref:../rgcms/rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_classes_value-types_Blob[`Blob`].
The `IsisSchemas` parameter to the action can be used to optionally ignore the common xref:../rgcms/rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_schema[Apache Isis schemas] (useful if there is only one other XSD schema referenced by the DTO).

The `Dto_downloadXml` and `Dto_downloadXsd` delegate to the xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_integration-api_JaxbService[`JaxbService`] to actually generate the XML/XSD.
