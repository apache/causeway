This class provides an implementation of the optional `getId()` method for domain services, based upon the classes name.

In practice there is little to gain from subclassing.
Instead annotate with xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant_DomainService[`@DomainService`] and specify its xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant_DomainService_objectType[`#objectType()`]
