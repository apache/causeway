The quickest way to get started with Apache Isis is to run the simple archetype.  This will generate a very simple one-class domain model, called `SimpleObject`, with a single property `name`.  There is also a corresponding `SimpleObjectRepository` domain service.  From this you can easily rename these initial classes, and extend to build up your own Apache Isis domain application.





== Generating the App

Create a new directory, and `cd` into that directory.

Then run the following command:

[source,bash]
----
mvn archetype:generate  \
    -D archetypeGroupId=org.apache.isis.archetype \
    -D archetypeArtifactId=simpleapp-archetype \
    -D archetypeVersion=1.8.0 \
    -D groupId=com.mycompany \
    -D artifactId=myapp \
    -D version=1.0-SNAPSHOT \
    -B
----

where:

- `groupId` represents your own organization, and
- `artifactId` is a unique identifier for this app within your organization.
- `version` is the initial (snapshot) version of your app

The archetype generation process will then run; it only takes a few seconds.




=== Snapshot release

We also maintain the archetype for the most current `-SNAPSHOT`; an app generated with this archetype will contain the latest features of Apache Isis, but the usual caveats apply: some features still in development may be unstable.

The process is almost identical to that for stable releases, however the `archetype:generate` goal is called with slightly different arguments:

[source,bash]
----
mvn archetype:generate  \
    -D archetypeGroupId=org.apache.isis.archetype \
    -D archetypeArtifactId=simpleapp-archetype \
    -D archetypeVersion=1.10.0-SNAPSHOT \
    -D groupId=com.mycompany \
    -D artifactId=myapp \
    -D version=1.0-SNAPSHOT \
    -D archetypeRepository=http://repository-estatio.forge.cloudbees.com/snapshot/ \
    -B
----

where as before:

- `groupId` represents your own organization, and
- `artifactId` is a unique identifier for this app within your organization.
- `version` is the initial (snapshot) version of your app

but also:

- `archetypeVersion` is the SNAPSHOT version of Apache Isis.
- `archetypeRepository` specifies the location of our snapshot repo (hosted on [CloudBees](http://www.cloudbees.com)), and

The archetype generation process will then run; it only takes a few seconds.




== Building the App

Switch into the root directory of your newly generated app, and build your app:

[source,bash]
----
cd myapp
mvn clean install
----

where `myapp` is the `artifactId` entered above.




== Running the App

The `simpleapp` archetype generates a single WAR file, configured to run both the link:./guides/ug.html#_ug_wicket-viewer[Wicket viewer] and the link:./guides/ug.html#_ug_restfulobjects-viewer[Restful Objects viewer].   The archetype also configures the JDO/DataNucleus objectstore to use an in-memory HSQLDB connection.  

Once you've built the app, you can run the WAR in a variety of ways. 

The recommended approach when getting started is to run the self-hosting version of the WAR, allowing Apache Isis to run as a standalone app; for example:

[source,bash]
----
java -jar webapp/target/myapp-webapp-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jetty-console.jar
----



This can also be accomplished using an embedded Ant target provided in the build script:


[source,bash]
----
mvn -P self-host antrun:run
----


    
The first is to simply deploying the generated WAR (`webapp/target/myapp-webapp-1.0-SNAPSHOT.war`) to a servlet container.


Alternatively, you could run the WAR in a Maven-hosted Jetty instance, though you need to `cd` into the `webapp` module:

[source,bash]
----
cd webapp
mvn jetty:run -D jetty.port=9090
----


In the above, we've passed in a property to indicate a different port from the default port (8080).

Note that if you use `mvn jetty:run`, then the context path changes; check the console output (eg [http://localhost:9090/myapp-webapp](http://localhost:9090/myapp-webapp)).

Finally, you can also run the app by deploying to a standalone servlet container such as [Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org).




=== With Fixtures

It is also possible to start the application with a pre-defined set of data; useful for demos or manual exploratory
testing.  This is done by specifying a _fixture script_ on the command line:


[source,bash]
----
java -jar webapp/target/myapp-webapp-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jetty-console.jar \
     --initParam isis.persistor.datanucleus.install-fixtures=true  \
     --initParam isis.fixtures=fixture.simple.SimpleObjectsFixture
----

    
where (in the above example) `fixture.simple.SimpleObjectsFixture` is the fully qualified class name of the fixture 
script to be run.




== Using the App

The archetype provides a welcome page that explains the classes and files generated, and provides detailed guidance and what to do next.

The app itself is configured to run using shiro security, as configured in the `WEB-INF/shiro.ini` config file.  To log in, use `sven/pass`.



== Modifying the App

Once you are familiar with the generated app, you'll want to start modifying it.  Check out our the link:.guides/ug.html[Users' Guide], which has how-tos and a complete reference guide (as well as some background concepts and discussion of more advanced techniques).

If you use IntelliJ or Eclipse, you'll also want to set up your IDE; this is also described in the link:cg.adoc#_cg_ide[Contributors' Guide].


== App Structure

As noted above, the generated app is a very simple application consisting of a single domain object that can be easily renamed and extended. The intention is not to showcase all of Apache Isis' capabilities; rather it is to allow you to very easily modify the generated application (eg rename `SimpleObject` to `Customer`) without having to waste time deleting lots of generated code.
