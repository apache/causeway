The (internal) `PublishingServiceInternal` domain service acts as an internal facade to any configured xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_persistence-layer-spi_PublisherService[`PublisherService`] domain service(s).

For published action invocations/ property edits, it provides an API for those member executions to call.

For published objects, it provides an API for the framework to call at the end of the interaction; it obtains details of the changed objects (from the xref:../rgfis/rgfis.adoc#_rgfis_persistence-layer_ChangedObjectsServiceInternal[`ChangedObjectsServiceInternal`]) and filters them to just those objects that are to be published; these are then passed through to any configured `PublisherService` implementations.


== SPI and Implementation

The SPI of the service is:

[source,java]
----
public class PublishingServiceInternal {
    void publishAction(                             // <1>
            Interaction.Execution execution);
    void publishProperty(                           // <2>
            Interaction.Execution execution);
    void publishObjects();                          // <3>
}
----
<1> to publish an action invocation, as represented by the specified member `Execution` parameter and with the xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-Action_publishing[`@Action#publishing()`] annotation attribute or equivalent, to any configured xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_persistence-layer-spi_PublisherService[`PublisherService`].
The `Execution` object will be an instance of `ActionInvocation` (see xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_application-layer-api_InteractionContext[`InteractionContext`] for details).
<2> to publish a property edit, as as represented by the specified member `Execution` parameter and with the xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-Property_publishing[`@Property#publishing()`] annotation attribute or equivalent, to any configured xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_persistence-layer-spi_PublisherService[`PublisherService`].
The `Execution` object will be an instance of `PropertyEdit` (see xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_application-layer-api_InteractionContext[`InteractionContext`] for details).
<3> to publish all changed objects that are to be published (with the xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainObject_publishing[`@DomainObject#publishing()`] annotation attribute or equivalent).


The service implementation is `o.a.i.c.m.s.publishing.PublishingServiceInternal`.



== Registering the Service

Apache Isis' default implementation of `PublishingServiceInternal` class is automatically registered (it is annotated with `@DomainService`) so no further configuration is required.

To use an alternative implementation, use xref:../rgant/rgant.adoc#_rgant-DomainServiceLayout_menuOrder[`@DomainServiceLayout#menuOrder()`] (as explained in the xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc adoc#__rgsvc_intro_overriding-the-services[introduction] to this guide).


== Related Classes

The service delegates between the (internal) xref:../rgfis/rgfis.adoc#_rgfis_persistence-layer_ChangedObjectsServiceInternal[`ChangedObjectsServiceInternal`] domain service to the configured xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_persistence-layer-spi_PublisherService[`PublisherService`].

The (internal) xref:../rgfis/rgfis.adoc#_rgfis_persistence-layer_AuditingServiceInternal[`AuditingServiceInternal`] performs a similar function for the xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_persistence-layer-spi_PublisherService[`PublisherService`], also collating details of the changed objects from `ChangedObjectsServiceInternal`.
