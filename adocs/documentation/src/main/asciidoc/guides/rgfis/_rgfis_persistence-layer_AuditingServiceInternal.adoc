The (internal) `AuditingServiceInternal` domain service acts as an internal facade to any registered xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_persistence-layer-spi_AuditerService[`AuditerService`] service(s).
It is responsible for obtaining the details of all changes to domain objects within an interaction, and then to call the configured ``AuditerService``(s) to actually create audit entries of those changes.




== SPI and Implementation

The SPI of the service is:

[source,java]
----
public class AuditingServiceInternal {
    public boolean canAudit();              // <1>
    public void audit();                    // <2>
}
----
<1> minor performance optimization as to whether any auditing services are actually enabled; checks to see if any xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_persistence-layer-spi_AuditerService[`AuditerService`] are enabled.
<2> uses the xref:../rgfis/rgfis.adoc#_rgfis_persistence-layer_ChangedObjectsServiceInternal[`ChangedObjectsServiceInternal`] to obtain details of the changed properties, then call the configured xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_persistence-layer-spi_AuditerService[`AuditerService`](s).

The service implementation is `o.a.i.c.r.s.auditing.AuditingServiceInternal`.



== Registering the Service

Apache Isis' default implementation of `AuditingServiceInternal` class is automatically registered (it is annotated with `@DomainService`) so no further configuration is required.


== Related Classes

The service delegates between the (internal) xref:../rgfis/rgfis.adoc#_rgfis_persistence-layer_ChangedObjectsServiceInternal[`ChangedObjectsServiceInternal`] domain service  to the configured xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_persistence-layer-spi_AuditerService[`AuditerService`](s).
If no such service(s) are configured, then _this_ service is in effect a no-op.

The (internal) xref:../rgfis/rgfis.adoc#_rgfis_persistence-layer_PublishingServiceInternal[`PublishingServiceInternal`] performs a similar function for the xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_persistence-layer-spi_PublisherService[`PublisherService`], also collating details of the changed objects from `ChangedObjectsServiceInternal`.
