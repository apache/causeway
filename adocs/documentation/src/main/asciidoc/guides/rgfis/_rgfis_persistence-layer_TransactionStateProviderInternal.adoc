The (internal) `TransactionStateProviderInternal` domain service simply provides the ability to check as to the state of the current transaction.

[NOTE]
====
This service has been removed in `1.15.0-SNAPSHOT`, having been combined with xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_application-layer-api_TransactionService[`TransactionService`].
====


== SPI and Implementation

The SPI of the service is simply:

[source,java]
----
public interface TransactionStateProviderInternal {
    TransactionState getTransactionState();
}
----


== Runtime vs Noop implementation

The framework provides two implementations:

* `TransactionStateProviderInternalDefault` is provided by `isis-core-runtime`, and is used during normal use and integration tests

* `TransactionStateProviderInternalNoop` is provided as a fallback by `isis-core-metamodel`, and is provided to allow the xref:../rgmvn/rgmvn.adoc#[maven plugin] to be bootstrapped without any "backend" database.

The `...Default` implementation takes priority over the `...Noop` implementation.
