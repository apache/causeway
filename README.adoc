= Apache Causeway - Version 2.x (retired)

This branch is in the process of being decommissioned.

Version `2.1.0` was the very last _2.x_ release.

For _Apache Causeway_ documentation see: https://causeway.apache.org/

[WARNING]
====
This branch has vulnerabilities, see

== Build your own (Version `2.x`) 

Here are the recommended build instructions:

- use sdkman see https://sdkman.io
- install _Maven 3.9.12_ `sdk install maven 3.9.12`
- install _Java 25_ `sdk install java 25.0.1-tem`
- verify Maven and Java versions are as desired: `mvn -v`

Now build with _mvn_ command:
----
mvn install \
 -Drevision=2.2.0-SNAPSHOT \
 -Dmaven.compiler.release=11 \
 -Dmaven.compiler.proc=full \
 -Dmaven.source.skip=true \
 -Dmodule-regressiontests \
 -T 6 \
 -e
----

Note: the `revision` parameter can be set as desired

== Legacy (isis) Build

Before running the above `mvn install ...` one has to run:
----
export ROOT_PATH_LEGACY=$(pwd)
jshell scripts/ci/rename-all-published-sources.jsh
----

This will rename artifacts and packages from `causeway` to `isis`.

== CI Build using Gitlab

One can setup a gitlab repository just for the purpose of 
building and deploying _Causeway_ artifacts.

A minimal build script could look like:

[source,yaml]
..gitlab-ci.yml
----
image: maven:3.9.12-eclipse-temurin-25

include:
  - local: ci/causeway-v2.yml
  - local: ci/isis-v2.yml

stages:
  - checkout-patch-deploy
----

where the actual jobs are declared in their own files in the `ci` directory: 

TODO flesh out `ci/causeway-v2.yml`

TODO flesh out `ci/isis-v2.yml`
