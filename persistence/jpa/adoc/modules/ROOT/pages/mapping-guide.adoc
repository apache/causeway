There are plenty of resources for learning JPA annotations.
Take a look at:

* link:https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-book/tree/master/jpa/src/main/java/com/oreilly/springdata/jpa[Spring Daata Book - sample code showing several entities]

Although written for Hibernate, the JPA material should work fine.

== Custom Value Types

The framework provides a number of custom value types.
Some of these are wrappers around a single value (eg `AsciiDoc` or `Password`) while others map onto multiple values (eg `Blob`).

This section shows how to map each (and can be adapted for your own custom types or `@Embedded` values).


=== Mapping AsciiDoc

TODO: not really sufficient to use `@Lob`; should provide a custom converter.


=== Mapping Blobs and Clobs

While the JPA standard does provide a standardised mechanism to marshall single valued types, but does not (currently) provide a standardised mechanism to marshall multiple valued types.

There are two alternatives:

* use EclipseLink-specific extensions, specifically its link:https://www.eclipse.org/eclipselink/documentation/2.5/jpa/extensions/a_transformation.htm[@Transformation] annotation and the related link:https://www.eclipse.org/eclipselink/documentation/2.5/jpa/extensions/a_writetransformer.htm#BGBGGAEA[@WriteTransformer] and link:https://www.eclipse.org/eclipselink/documentation/2.5/jpa/extensions/a_readtransformer.htm#CHDGHHBA[@ReadTransformer].

* manually map the class to an link:https://www.eclipse.org/eclipselink/documentation/3.0/concepts/entities005.htm#BABGBFDG[@Embeddable] class.

We think the second approach is less boilerplate overall, and is easier to understand what is going on.
The framework provides an `@Embeddable` classes for each of `Blob` and `Clob`, explained in the sections below.

==== Blobs

To map a xref:refguide:applib:index/value/Blob.adoc[Blob], use the xref:refguide:persistence:index/jpa/applib/types/BlobJpaEmbedded.adoc[BlobJpaEmbedded] class:

[source]
.MyEntity.java
----
public class MyEntity ... {

    @Embedded
    private BlobJpaEmbeddable pdf;              // <.>

    @Property()
    @PropertyLayout()
    public Blob getPdf() {                      // <.>
        return BlobJpaEmbeddable.toBlob(pdf);
    }
    public void setPdf(final Blob pdf) {
        this.pdf = BlobJpaEmbeddable.fromBlob(pdf);
    }
}
----

<.> the field as it is persisted by the ORM
<.> the property as it is understood by Apache Isis.


TIP: if you have multiple instancs of an `@Embedded` type, the `@javax.persistence.AttributeOverrides` and `@javax.persistence.AttributeOverride` provide a standardised way of fine-tuning the column definitions.

==== Clobs

To map a xref:refguide:applib:index/value/Clob.adoc[Clob], use the xref:refguide:persistence:index/jpa/applib/types/ClobJpaEmbedded.adoc[ClobJpaEmbedded] class:

[source]
.MyEntity.java
----
public class MyEntity ... {

    @Embedded
    private ClobJpaEmbeddable xml;              // <.>

    @Property()
    @PropertyLayout()
    public Clob getXml() {                      // <.>
        return ClobJpaEmbeddable.toClob(xml);
    }
    public void setXml(final Clob xml) {
        this.xml = ClobJpaEmbeddable.fromClob(xml);
    }
}

<.> the field as it is persisted by the ORM
<.> the property as it is understood by Apache Isis.
