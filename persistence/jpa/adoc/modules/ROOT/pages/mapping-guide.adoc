There are plenty of resources for learning JPA annotations.
Take a look at:

* link:https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-book/tree/master/jpa/src/main/java/com/oreilly/springdata/jpa[Spring Daata Book - sample code showing several entities]

* link:https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/JavaPersistenceAPI/article.html[Vogella JPA tutorial]

* link:https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/annotations/3.5/reference/en/html/entity.html[JBoss reference guide]
