In the same way that Java packages act as a namespace for domain objects, it's good practice to map domain entities to their own (database) schemas.
(For more on database schemas, see for example link:https://crate.io/docs/sql-99/en/latest/chapters/17.html#create-schema-statement[here]).

We recommend all the entities within a module use the same schema, and moreover that the xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/DomainObject.adoc#logicalTypeName[logical type name] also follows the same pattern.

For example, xref:security:secman:about.adoc[SecMan]' JPA implementation resides in the `IsisModuleExtSecmanPersistenceJpa` module.
Its `ApplicationUser` entity is defined as:

[source,java]
.ApplicationUser.java
----
@Entity
@Table(
        schema = "isisExtensionsSecman",
        name = "ApplicationUser",
        ...
)
public class ApplicationUser ... { /* ... */ }
----

which results in a `CREATE TABLE` statement of:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE isisExtensionsSecman."ApplicationUser" (
    ...
)
----
