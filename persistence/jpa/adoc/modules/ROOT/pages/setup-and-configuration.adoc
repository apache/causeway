This section describes how to include the JPA module and setup its configuration properties.

include::docs:mavendeps:partial$setup-and-configure-mavendeps-jpa.adoc[leveloffset=+1]



== Update AppManifest

In your application's `AppManifest` (top-level Spring `@Configuration` used to bootstrap the app), import the

[source,java]
.AppManifest.java
----
@Configuration
@Import({
        ...
        CausewayModuleJpaEclipselink.class,
        ...
})
public class AppManifest {
}
----

== DataSource

The JPA object store uses Spring to provide a `javax.sql.DataSource`.
Normally this is done by setting the `spring.datasource` configuration properties, as described in the
link:https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/spring-boot-features.html#boot-features-connect-to-production-database-configuration[Spring Boot] documentation.

For example, the xref:docs:starters:simpleapp.adoc[SimpleApp] starter app defines these:

* for H2 (in-memory):
+
[source,properties]
.app.properties
----
spring.sql.init.platform=h2
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:simple;MODE=LEGACY
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=org.h2.Driver
----
NOTE: Eclipse Link needs `MODE=LEGACY` in the url above, because of this bug in EclipseLink: link:https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/eclipselink/issues/1393[eclipselink-issue-1393]

* for SQL Server:
+
[source,properties]
.app.properties
----
spring.sql.init.platform=sqlserver
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:sqlserver://localhost;databaseName=simpleapp
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerDriver
spring.datasource.username=simpleapp
spring.datasource.password=simpleapp
----

It is also possible to programmatically define a `DataSource`; see the link:https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/howto.html#howto-data-access[Spring docs] for details.



== EclipseLink Configuration Properties

The following configuration properties are set by default:

* link:https://www.eclipse.org/eclipselink/documentation/2.7/jpa/extensions/persistenceproperties_ref.htm#weaving[eclipselink.weaving]
+
is set to `false`

* link:https://www.eclipse.org/eclipselink/documentation/2.7/jpa/extensions/persistenceproperties_ref.htm#BABHEJJI[eclipselink.ddl-generation]
+
is set to `create-or-extend-tables`

* "jakarta.persistence.bean.manager"
+
is set to an Apache Causeway implementation, to assist with dependency injection into entities.

Generally these should not be changed, though if there is a requirement, then provide an alternate implementation of `org.apache.causeway.persistence.jpa.eclipselink.config.ElSettings` with an earlier `@Priority` precedence.

To set other EclipseLink configuration properties, use a subclass of xref:refguide:persistence:index/jpa/eclipselink/CausewayModulePersistenceJpaEclipselink.adoc[] and override `getVendorProperties()`.


== Other Configuration Properties

The JPA object store also supports the following configuration properties:

* xref:refguide:config:sections/causeway.persistence.schema.adoc#causeway.persistence.schema.additional-orm-files[causeway.persistence.schema.additional-orm-files]
+
Lookup additional "mapping-files" in `META-INF/orm-_name_.xml` (equivalent to "mapping-file" entries in `persistence.xml`) and adds these to those that are already configured the _Spring Data_ way (if any).
