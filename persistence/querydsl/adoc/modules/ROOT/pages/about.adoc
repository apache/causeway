link:http://querydsl.com/[QueryDSL] provides a way to express type-safe queries.
Apache Causeway's integration with QueryDSL provides the following capabilities:

* xref:refguide:persistence:index/querydsl/applib/services/repo/QueryDslRepository.adoc[]
+
Intended to be subclassed (it is `abstract`), and parameterized by the entity and its corresponding "Q" query class, this class provides a set of finder methods for a specified entity.
+
These finder methods take queries written as QueryDSL expressions.
More discussion on writing queries can be found xref:example-queries.adoc[here].
+
Internally, this class delegates to xref:refguide:persistence:index/querydsl/applib/services/support/QueryDslSupport.adoc[].

* xref:refguide:persistence:index/querydsl/applib/services/support/QueryDslSupport.adoc[] and xref:refguide:persistence:index/querydsl/applib/services/support/DetachedQueryFactory.adoc[]
+
Provides the mechanism to construct arbitrary queries against any entity.
+
The query expressions from xref:refguide:persistence:index/querydsl/applib/services/support/QueryDslSupport.adoc[] are attached, meaning they can be submitted directly to the database.
Those from xref:refguide:persistence:index/querydsl/applib/services/support/DetachedQueryFactory.adoc[] are detached; they cannot be submitted directly.
Instead, they are intended to be combined with the attached queries, e.g. in subqueries.
+
The xref:refguide:persistence:index/querydsl/applib/services/support/QueryDslSupport.adoc[] service is abstract, while the the xref:pjpa::about.adoc[JPA/EclipseLink] persistence mechanism provides the concrete implementations.

* xref:refguide:persistence:index/querydsl/applib/services/auto/AutoCompleteGeneratedQueryService.adoc[]
+
Primarily used internally to provide support for autocomplete (using xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/Property.adoc[@Property] and optionally xref:refguide:applib:index/annotation/DomainObject.adoc[@DomainObject]).
However, the service can also be called directly by the application if required.
+
More discussion on using the annotations can be found xref:autocomplete-annotations.adoc[here].
