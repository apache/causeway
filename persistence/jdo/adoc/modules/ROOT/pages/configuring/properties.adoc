(`o.a.i.os.` +
`jdo.dn.` +
`CreateSchemaObject` +

|`isis.persistor.` +
`datanucleus.` +
`RegisterEntities.` +
`packagePrefix`
|fully qualified package names, CSV
|This property is derived automatically derived from the set of modules provided in the xref:refguide:applib-cm:classes/super.adoc#AppManifest[`AppManifest`], and so does not need to be specified explicitly.

It holds the set of packages to search so that DataNucleus builds its metamodel eagerly rather than lazily.
