JDO/DataNucleus supports the ability to map the entity that is mapped to a view rather than a database table.
Moreover, DataNucleus itself can create/maintain this view.

One use case for this is to support use cases which act upon aggregate information.
An link:https://github.com/estatio/estatio/blob/b77d0b03ec86463227ba90f8341299066ddba69f/estatioapp/module/lease/dom/src/main/java/org/estatio/dom/lease/invoicing/viewmodel/InvoiceSummaryForPropertyDueDateStatus.java#L57[example] is in the (non-ASF) http://github.com/estatio/estatio[Estatio] application, which uses a view to define an "invoice run": a representatoin of all pending invoices to be sent out for a particular shopping centre.
(Note that example also shows the entity as being "non-durable", but if the view is read/write then -- I think -- that this isn't necessary required).
